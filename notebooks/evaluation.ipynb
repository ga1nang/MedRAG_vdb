      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Crusted Scabies (Norwegian Scabies)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The widespread, exfoliative rash, especially in the axillae, buttocks, and thighs, along with fissures on the wrists and knees, is highly characteristic of crusted scabies. The presence of flakes of skin on the mattress further supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "*   **Patient Demographics:** The patient is an indigenous Australian woman living in a remote community, which is a known risk factor for endemic scabies.\n",
      "*   **Systemic Symptoms:** The patient's fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and low blood pressure indicate sepsis, which is a common complication of crusted scabies due to secondary bacterial infections.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The skin scrapings confirmed the presence of scabies mites and eggs, supporting the diagnosis. The blood cultures revealed *Staphylococcus aureus* infection, which is a common secondary bacterial infection in crusted scabies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Initial Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial management should focus on:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Stabilization:** Addressing the patient's sepsis with oxygen, intravenous fluids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone and gentamicin) to cover for potential Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.\n",
      "2.  **Isolation:** Implementing strict contact precautions to prevent the spread of scabies to healthcare workers and other patients.\n",
      "3.  **Treatment:** Initiating a comprehensive scabies treatment regimen, including:\n",
      "    *   **Ivermectin:** A systemic anti-parasitic medication.\n",
      "    *   **Topical Scabicide:** Benzyl benzoate to kill the mites.\n",
      "    *   **Keratolytic Cream:** Lactic acid and urea cream to help remove the crusts.\n",
      "4.  **Environmental Control:** Treating the patient's home and belongings to eliminate mites.\n",
      "5.  **Family Treatment:** Treating all household contacts to prevent re-infection.\n",
      "6.  **Follow-up:** Regular follow-up with the health staff to monitor the patient's progress and ensure treatment effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The patient's age and immunocompromised state (due to the underlying condition) may increase the risk of complications.\n",
      "*   The possibility of other conditions (e.g., psoriasis, tinea corporis, skin malignancies) should be considered, but the clinical presentation strongly favors crusted scabies.\n",
      "*   The patient's MRSA infection requires appropriate antibiotic therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the provisional diagnosis is **Crusted Scabies (Norwegian Scabies)**, and the initial management should focus on stabilizing the patient, treating the scabies infection, and preventing the spread of the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with chronic back pain, progressive spastic paraparesis (difficulty walking), and a thoracic sensory level. This is a classic presentation of spinal cord compression.\n",
      "*   **Location:** The tenderness over the lower thoracic spine and the sensory level between T9 and T11 strongly suggest a lesion in the thoracic spinal cord.\n",
      "*   **History:** The patient's history of back pain for a year, followed by progressive neurological deficits, is consistent with a slowly progressive spinal cord process. The traditional healer's tattoos are a clue, although not definitive.\n",
      "*   **HIV Status:** The patient's HIV-positive status is a significant risk factor for opportunistic infections, including spinal TB.\n",
      "*   **Radiographic Findings:** The radiograph showing collapse of the T11 vertebral body and soft tissue swelling around the spine is highly suggestive of spinal TB.\n",
      "*   **Differential Diagnosis:** While other possibilities exist (e.g., spinal metastases, transverse myelitis, other causes of spinal cord compression), the combination of clinical and radiographic findings makes spinal TB the most probable diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Further Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Confirmation of Diagnosis:**\n",
      "    *   **Biopsy:** A spinal biopsy is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of spinal TB.\n",
      "    *   **MRI:** MRI of the spine is helpful to assess the extent of the lesion and the degree of spinal cord compression.\n",
      "2.  **Treatment:**\n",
      "    *   **Antituberculous Therapy:** Standard first-line antituberculous treatment (e.g., isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) should be initiated promptly.\n",
      "    *   **Vitamin B6:** Supplementation with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is recommended to prevent peripheral neuropathy, a common side effect of isoniazid.\n",
      "    *   **Surgical Intervention:** Surgical decompression may be considered in cases of severe spinal cord compression, instability, or failure of conservative treatment.\n",
      "3.  **Supportive Care:**\n",
      "    *   **Physiotherapy:** Physiotherapy is essential to maintain muscle strength and prevent contractures.\n",
      "    *   **Guardian Training:** Training the patient's guardian to provide proper care and support is crucial.\n",
      "    *   **Pain Management:** Pain relief should be provided to improve the patient's quality of life.\n",
      "    *   **Psychosocial Support:** The patient and his family will need psychosocial support to cope with the challenges of spinal cord disease.\n",
      "    *   **HIV Management:** Optimize antiretroviral therapy to improve immune function and reduce the risk of opportunistic infections.\n",
      "4.  **Monitoring:**\n",
      "    *   Regular follow-up is necessary to monitor the patient's response to treatment and to detect any complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the patient's presentation is highly suggestive of spinal tuberculosis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with antituberculous therapy are essential to prevent further neurological deterioration and improve the patient's prognosis.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Chancroid**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The description of numerous, painful, soft, and bleeding ulcers on the penis, scrotum, and inner thigh is highly characteristic of chancroid.\n",
      "*   **History:** The patient's unprotected sex with a commercial sex worker is a significant risk factor for chancroid.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Lymphadenopathy:** The absence of painful inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes) is more consistent with chancroid than syphilis. While lymphadenopathy is common in syphilis, it's often painless.\n",
      "*   **Treatment Response:** The patient's rapid improvement with erythromycin treatment is also suggestive of chancroid.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Confirmation:** The growth of *Haemophilus ducreyi* from a swab taken from the ulcer confirms the diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While chancroid is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities should be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Syphilis:** Primary syphilis can present with a single, painless ulcer, but the multiple, painful ulcers and the patient's history make this less likely.\n",
      "*   **Herpes Simplex:** Herpes ulcers are typically less painful and often have a more vesicular appearance.\n",
      "*   **Granuloma Inguinale (Donovanosis):** This presents with painless, progressive ulcerative lesions, but the lesions are typically more chronic and less likely to respond rapidly to antibiotics.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The management plan described in the text is appropriate:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Syphilis Treatment:** Benzathine penicillin is the treatment of choice for syphilis.\n",
      "*   **Chancroid Treatment:** Erythromycin is an effective treatment for chancroid.\n",
      "*   **HIV Testing:** Given the patient's risk factors, HIV testing is essential.\n",
      "*   **Partner Notification:** It's crucial to inform the patient's sexual partners about the diagnosis and encourage them to seek medical attention.\n",
      "*   **Culture:** Culture of *Haemophilus ducreyi* is important to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, based on the clinical presentation, history, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is chancroid, and the recommended treatment plan is appropriate.**\n",

      "Based on the provided information, the most important differential diagnoses for this 16-year-old Malawian girl with fever, abdominal pain, headache, mild jaundice, splenomegaly, and low-grade anemia are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Malaria:** This is a very common cause of fever and abdominal pain in malaria-endemic areas, especially in young women. The positive malaria test with low parasitaemia is consistent with this diagnosis.\n",
      "2.  **Enteric Fever (Typhoid or Paratyphoid):** The abdominal pain, headache, splenomegaly, and mild jaundice are all suggestive of enteric fever. The incubation period is also consistent with the 5-day history.\n",
      "3.  **Other possibilities:**\n",
      "    *   **Bacterial sepsis:** Although less likely given the negative blood cultures, it's important to rule out.\n",
      "    *   **Other infections:** Viral infections, bacterial infections (other than Salmonella), or parasitic infections (e.g., schistosomiasis) could also be considered, but are less likely given the clinical picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Approach to the Patient:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Immediate Actions:**\n",
      "    *   **Start treatment for malaria:** Given the positive malaria test and the patient's symptoms, begin antimalarial treatment according to national guidelines and local resistance patterns. Artemether/lumefantrine is a good choice.\n",
      "    *   **Start broad-spectrum antibiotics:** Initiate empirical antibiotic therapy to cover for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including *Salmonella* species. Ceftriaxone is a reasonable choice.\n",
      "    *   **Blood cultures:** Obtain blood cultures before starting antibiotics to identify the causative organism.\n",
      "    *   **Repeat HIV test:** Repeat the HIV test to confirm the initial negative result.\n",
      "    *   **Assess hydration status:** Ensure adequate hydration, especially if the patient is experiencing diarrhea or vomiting.\n",
      "    *   **Monitor vital signs:** Closely monitor temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Further Investigations:**\n",
      "    *   **Repeat HIV test:** Repeat the HIV test to confirm the initial negative result.\n",
      "    *   **Liver function tests (LFTs):** Although reagents are out of stock, obtain LFTs as soon as possible to assess for liver involvement.\n",
      "    *   **Complete blood count (CBC):** Repeat the CBC to monitor for changes in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count.\n",
      "    *   **Urinalysis:** Perform a urinalysis to rule out urinary tract infection.\n",
      "    *   **Abdominal ultrasound:** Perform an abdominal ultrasound to assess the liver, spleen, and other abdominal organs. This can help rule out posthepatic causes of jaundice and assess the size and texture of the liver and spleen.\n",
      "    *   **Consider other investigations:** Depending on the patient's clinical course and response to treatment, consider further investigations such as stool culture, urine culture, and serological tests for other infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Management:**\n",
      "    *   **Continue antimalarial treatment:** Continue antimalarial treatment until the patient is afebrile for 24-48 hours.\n",
      "    *   **Switch antibiotics:** If blood cultures grow *Salmonella* species, switch to a more specific antibiotic such as ciprofloxacin.\n",
      "    *   **Monitor for complications:** Monitor for complications such as intestinal perforation, myocarditis, or overwhelming toxaemia.\n",
      "    *   **Provide supportive care:** Provide supportive care such as fluids, nutrition, and pain relief.\n",
      "    *   **Consider vaccination:** Discuss the possibility of typhoid conjugate vaccine with the patient and her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Follow-up:**\n",
      "    *   **Follow-up with the patient and her family:** Follow up with the patient and her family to ensure that she is recovering well and to address any concerns they may have.\n",
      "    *   **Consider prophylaxis:** Consider prophylaxis for close contacts of the patient, especially if they are at high risk of infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the most likely diagnosis is enteric fever (typhoid or paratyphoid), but malaria must be ruled out and treated promptly. A comprehensive approach involving blood cultures, repeat HIV testing, and appropriate investigations is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective management.**\n",

      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for the 22-year-old woman from Bangladesh is **Cholera**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a history of profuse watery diarrhea resembling diluted milk or rice water, which is a classic symptom of cholera. The absence of fever and abdominal pain is also consistent with cholera.\n",
      "*   **Physical Findings:** The patient's physical examination reveals signs of dehydration, including sunken eyes, dry mouth, scaphoid abdomen, and slow skin pinch. These findings are indicative of significant fluid loss.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Results:** The stool examination shows the presence of *Vibrio cholerae* in the stool, confirmed by culture. The microscopic examination showing slender curved bacilli with darting motility is also characteristic of *V. cholerae*.\n",
      "*   **Epidemiological Context:** The patient's recent attendance at a religious festival where water was supplied in large metal containers, along with the presence of other ill individuals, strongly suggests an outbreak of cholera.\n",
      "*   **Outbreak:** The presence of multiple cases of diarrhea among attendees of the same event supports the diagnosis of an outbreak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and epidemiological context, the most likely diagnosis is cholera.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Melioidosis**, specifically a localized parotitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a unilateral, suppurative parotid swelling, fever, and purulent discharge from the ear. This is a classic presentation of melioidosis, particularly in endemic areas.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** The patient is from Laos, a region known to be endemic for melioidosis.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** Isolation of *Burkholderia pseudomallei* from the pus culture strongly supports the diagnosis of melioidosis.\n",
      "*   **Risk Factors:** The patient's occupation as a rice farmer increases the likelihood of exposure to *B. pseudomallei* in the soil and water.\n",
      "*   **Other Considerations:** While other diagnoses like bacterial parotitis (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae) are possible, the isolation of *B. pseudomallei* makes melioidosis the most probable diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis is **Melioidosis, localized parotitis.**\n",
      "\n",

      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a rapid onset of fever, confusion, drowsiness, convulsions, stiff neck, positive Kernig's sign, and a hazy CSF. These are all classic signs and symptoms of meningitis.\n",
      "*   **HIV Status:** While HIV can increase the risk of certain opportunistic infections, the acute and severe presentation is more suggestive of bacterial meningitis.\n",
      "*   **CSF Findings:** The hazy CSF with neutrophilic pleocytosis (high white blood cell count with a predominance of neutrophils) and low glucose is highly suggestive of bacterial meningitis.\n",
      "*   **Differential Diagnoses:** While cryptococcal meningitis (CCM) and tuberculous meningitis (TBM) are important considerations in HIV-positive patients, the acute onset, high CSF neutrophil count, and relatively high CD4 count (320 cells/μL) make them less likely than bacterial meningitis.\n",
      "*   **Treatment Priorities:** The immediate priority is to administer broad-spectrum antibiotics as quickly as possible. Ceftriaxone is the recommended first-line antibiotic.\n",
      "*   **Adjunctive Interventions:** Dexamethasone is generally not recommended in resource-limited settings due to lack of efficacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis is **acute bacterial meningitis, most likely caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae***.\n",
      "\n",

      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** Pancytopenia (low blood cell counts) is also a common finding in Talaromycosis, especially in immunocompromised individuals.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** The patient is from Thailand, which is an endemic area for Talaromycosis.\n",
      "*   **HIV Status:** The patient's HIV test came back positive, indicating significant immunosuppression, which is a major risk factor for Talaromycosis.\n",
      "*   **Histopathology:** The histopathology of the lymph node biopsy showing yeast-like structures is highly suggestive of Talaromycosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While Talaromycosis is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities should be considered, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **HIV:** Given the patient's HIV status, opportunistic infections like cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and other fungal infections should be considered.\n",
      "*   **CMV and EBV:** These viral infections can cause fever, lymphadenopathy, and rash, but umbilicated papular lesions are not typical.\n",
      "*   **Disseminated Tuberculosis:** TB can present with fever, lymphadenopathy, and skin lesions, but the lesions are usually not umbilicated.\n",
      "*   **Atypical Mycobacteria:** Infections with atypical mycobacteria can cause skin lesions and lymphadenopathy.\n",
      "*   **Melioidosis:** This is a bacterial infection endemic to Southeast Asia that can cause lymphadenitis and skin lesions.\n",
      "*   **Bartonella spp.:** These bacteria can cause bacillary angiomatosis, which presents with umbilicated papular lesions, but these lesions are usually erythematous.\n",
      "*   **Visceral Leishmaniasis:** This parasitic infection can cause fever, wasting, and lymphadenopathy, but it does not typically cause a papular rash.\n",
      "*   **Lymphoma:** Lymphomas can cause lymphadenopathy and skin lesions, but the lesions are usually not umbilicated.\n",
      "*   **Castleman's Disease:** This is a lymphoproliferative disorder that can cause lymphadenopathy and skin lesions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Further Investigations:** Blood cultures, cultures from the skin biopsy and lymph node, and further histopathological examination are crucial to confirm the diagnosis of Talaromycosis.\n",
      "*   **Treatment:** The patient should be started on intravenous liposomal amphotericin B followed by oral itraconazole.\n",
      "*   **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):** Initiating ART is essential to improve the patient's immune function and prevent further opportunistic infections.\n",
      "*   **Monitoring:** Close monitoring of the patient's response to treatment and ART is necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, geographic location, and HIV status, Talaromycosis is the most likely diagnosis. Further investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.**\n",

      "*   **History:** The patient's observation of similar eye changes and blindness in other family members in his village is a classic epidemiological clue.\n",
      "*   **Transmission:** The presence of biting flies near a fast-flowing river is consistent with the transmission vector of onchocerciasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While onchocerciasis is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities should be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Yaws:** This chronic infectious disease caused by *Treponema pallidum pertenue* can present with skin lesions and subcutaneous nodules. However, the corneal opacities are less typical of yaws.\n",
      "*   **Leprosy:** This chronic infectious disease caused by *Mycobacterium leprae* can cause skin lesions, nerve damage, and eye problems. The corneal opacities are less typical of leprosy.\n",
      "*   **Scabies:** This parasitic skin infestation can cause intense itching and skin changes. However, the subcutaneous nodules and corneal opacities are not typical of scabies.\n",
      "*   **Mansonellosis:** This parasitic infection can cause pruritus and skin lesions. However, the corneal opacities are less typical of Mansonellosis.\n",
      "*   **HIV:** HIV infection can cause a variety of skin conditions, including pruritic eruptions. However, the corneal opacities and subcutaneous nodules are not typical of HIV.\n",

      "\n",
      "The following investigations would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis of onchocerciasis:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Skin Snip Examination:** Examination of skin snips taken from the vicinity of a subcutaneous nodule under a microscope can reveal microfilariae of *Onchocerca volvulus*.\n",
      "*   **Slit-Lamp Examination of the Eyes:** Examination of the eyes under a slit lamp can reveal microfilariae in the anterior chamber of the eye and in the cornea.\n",
      "*   **Nodulectomy:** Removal of a subcutaneous nodule and examination of the tissue under a microscope can reveal adults of *O. volvulus*.\n",
      "*   **Serological Tests:** Serological tests that detect IgG4 responses to *O. volvulus* antigen (OvAg) and the recombinant Ov16 antigen are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). A positive result should be followed by ivermectin therapy.\n",
      "*   **Vector Sampling:** Testing of black fly pools for *O. volvulus* DNA (Ov150) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can help to assess the risk of reinfection.\n",
      "\n",

      "    *   Raised transaminases\n",
      "    *   The fact that she is from Sierra Leone, a known endemic area for Lassa fever, further strengthens this suspicion.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Response to Treatment:** The patient's lack of response to broad-spectrum antibiotics and antimalarials is a key indicator. Lassa fever is not typically responsive to these treatments.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** Sierra Leone is an endemic area for Lassa fever.\n",
      "*   **Confirmation:** The diagnosis was confirmed with antigen testing.\n",

      "1.  **Laboratory Tests:**\n",
      "    *   **Lassa Virus Antigen Test:** This is the most rapid and readily available test for Lassa fever.\n",
      "    *   **Lassa Virus PCR:** This is the most sensitive test but may not be available in all settings.\n",
      "    *   **Serology (IgM and IgG antibodies):** IgM antibodies may be positive early in the illness, but can also be falsely positive. IgG antibodies may be positive later in the illness.\n",
      "    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To assess for signs of infection and inflammation.\n",
      "    *   **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):** To assess for liver involvement.\n",
      "    *   **Renal Function Tests (RFTs):** To assess for renal impairment.\n",
      "    *   **Chest X-ray:** To assess for pulmonary involvement.\n",
      "    *   **Blood Cultures:** To rule out bacterial infections.\n",
      "2.  **Isolation:** The patient should be placed in a single room with negative pressure ventilation and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent the spread of the virus.\n",
      "3.  **Treatment:**\n",
      "    *   **Ribavirin:** IV ribavirin is the recommended treatment for Lassa fever. It is most effective when started early in the course of the illness.\n",
      "    *   **Supportive Care:** Supportive care, including fluid and electrolyte management, respiratory support, and management of complications, is essential.\n",
      "4.  **Contact Tracing:** All contacts of the patient should be identified and monitored for symptoms of Lassa fever.\n",
      "5.  **Public Health Measures:** Public health measures, such as rodent control and education, should be implemented in the community to prevent future outbreaks.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Okay, based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of my approach to managing this patient, along with the reasoning behind each step:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Initial Assessment and Stabilization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **ABCDEs:** Ensure the patient is stable (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure). This is always the first priority in any medical situation.\n",
      "*   **Brief History:** Gather a concise history focusing on:\n",
      "    *   The seizure itself: Onset, duration, frequency, and any associated symptoms (e.g., loss of consciousness, postictal confusion).\n",
      "    *   Preceding events: Any triggers, aura, or warning signs.\n",
      "    *   Medical history: HIV status, TB history, other relevant illnesses, medications, and allergies.\n",
      "    *   Social history: Occupation, living situation, and any potential exposures to infections.\n",
      "*   **Physical Examination:** A thorough neurological exam to assess for focal deficits, meningeal signs, and other abnormalities.\n",
      "*   **Basic Investigations:**\n",
      "    *   **Blood Tests:** Complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, glucose, renal function, liver function, and HIV viral load.\n",
      "    *   **Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT):** Rule out malaria, which is a common cause of seizures in endemic areas.\n",
      "    *   **Urine Analysis:** To rule out urinary tract infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the patient's HIV status, the following conditions should be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND):** This is a broad category that includes various neurological manifestations of HIV infection, including seizures.\n",
      "*   **Opportunistic Infections (OIs):**\n",
      "    *   **Tuberculosis (TB):** TB can cause brain lesions (tuberculomas) that can lead to seizures.\n",
      "    *   **Cryptococcal Meningitis/Encephalitis:** Cryptococcus is a common fungal infection in HIV-positive individuals.\n",
      "    *   **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML):** PML is a rare and often fatal viral infection caused by the JC virus. It typically presents with focal neurological deficits and seizures.\n",
      "    *   **Other OIs:** Less common OIs like toxoplasmosis, fungal abscesses, and lymphoma can also cause seizures.\n",
      "*   **Metabolic Causes:** Hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hypocalcemia), and hepatic encephalopathy can all cause seizures.\n",
      "*   **Structural Lesions:** Brain tumors, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and stroke can also cause seizures.\n",
      "*   **Epilepsy:** While less likely in a new-onset seizure, epilepsy should still be considered, especially if there are no other obvious causes.\n",
      "*   **Syncope/Pseudoseizures:** These conditions can mimic seizures and should be considered, especially in patients with a history of lightheadedness or fainting.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Investigations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Lumbar Puncture (LP):** This is crucial to rule out meningitis and encephalitis. The CSF should be analyzed for:\n",
      "    *   Cell count and differential\n",
      "    *   Protein and glucose levels\n",
      "    *   Gram stain and culture\n",
      "    *   India ink stain for Cryptococcus\n",
      "    *   Cryptococcal antigen\n",
      "    *   Viral PCR (for common viruses like herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and HIV)\n",
      "    *   JC virus DNA PCR (for PML)\n",
      "*   **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** This can help identify the type of seizure and localize the seizure focus.\n",
      "*   **Brain Imaging (CT or MRI):**\n",
      "    *   **CT Scan:** A CT scan is a good initial imaging study, especially if MRI is not readily available. It can help identify structural lesions, such as tumors, abscesses, and hemorrhage.\n",
      "    *   **MRI:** MRI is more sensitive than CT for detecting subtle brain lesions, such as those caused by PML or small infarcts.\n",
      "*   **HIV Viral Load and CD4 Count:** To assess the patient's immune status and guide treatment decisions.\n",
      "*   **Other Tests:** Depending on the clinical suspicion, other tests may be necessary, such as:\n",
      "    *   Tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA)\n",
      "    *   Blood cultures\n",
      "    *   Neuroimaging for other causes of seizures\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Seizure Management:**\n",
      "    *   **Benzodiazepines:** Administer benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, lorazepam) to stop the seizure.\n",
      "    *   **Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs):**\n",
      "        *   **Carbamazepine:** This is a commonly used AED in resource-limited settings. It is relatively inexpensive and effective for many types of seizures. However, it can interact with antiretroviral medications and should be used with caution in patients\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Brucella endocarditis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **History:** The patient's history of travel to Turkey, a known endemic area for Brucella, is a significant risk factor.\n",
      "*   **Symptoms:** The patient's initial presentation with fever, night sweats, chest pain, and fatigue is consistent with Brucella infection.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The negative blood cultures initially, followed by the isolation of *Brucella melitensis* biovar 2, strongly supports the diagnosis.\n",
      "*   **Imaging:** The echocardiogram showing a vegetation on the prosthetic mitral valve is highly suggestive of endocarditis.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Course:** The patient's deterioration after initial treatment with co-trimoxazole, followed by congestive heart failure, is a common complication of Brucella endocarditis.\n",
      "*   **Treatment Response:** The rapid improvement with rifampicin, doxycycline, and gentamicin is typical of Brucella treatment.\n",
      "*   **Further Complications:** The development of an annular abscess cavity around the aortic prosthesis further supports the diagnosis and indicates the severity of the infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis of Brucella endocarditis is the most likely explanation for the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Zika virus infection**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral edema, and lymphadenopathy, which are all consistent with Zika virus infection. The absence of fever is also more typical of Zika than dengue or chikungunya.\n",
      "*   **Travel History:** The patient's travel history to Central America, a region where Zika virus is endemic, is a significant risk factor.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The negative results for dengue and chikungunya RDTs, coupled with the positive Zika IgM and IgG results, strongly support a Zika diagnosis. The interpretation of the Dengue IgG as cross-reactivity is also consistent with the possibility of Zika.\n",
      "*   **Timeframe:** The patient's symptoms started 6 days after returning from the trip, which aligns with the typical incubation period for Zika virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis is most likely Zika virus infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided clinical presentation, history, and investigations, the most likely diagnosis is **Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), specifically East African Trypanosomiasis (T. brucei rhodesiense)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **History of Tsetse Fly Bites:** The patient's history of numerous painful bites by tsetse flies in the national game park is a significant clue. Tsetse flies are the vectors for *T. b. rhodesiense*.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The initial presentation with a circumscribed, painless swelling on the ankle (the \"trypanosomal chancre\"), fever, arthralgia, and a widespread urticarial rash is highly suggestive of HAT. The progression to anaphylactic shock is also consistent with the disease.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The presence of trypanosomes in the blood smear confirms the diagnosis.\n",
      "*   **Differential Diagnoses:** While other conditions like hypersensitivity reactions, schistosomiasis, and rickettsial diseases were considered, the presence of trypanosomes in the blood smear makes HAT the most likely diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Further Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Confirm Diagnosis:** The presence of trypanosomes in the blood smear confirms the diagnosis.\n",
      "2.  **Start Suramin Treatment:** Suramin is the treatment of choice for early-stage East African trypanosomiasis. The patient should receive a test dose of suramin followed by a course of suramin injections (as per the standard treatment protocol in the provided text).\n",
      "3.  **Monitor for Side Effects:** Suramin can cause side effects, including nephrotoxicity, so urine monitoring is essential.\n",
      "4.  **Check Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):** A lumbar puncture should be performed 24 hours after the first dose of suramin to assess for central nervous system involvement.\n",
      "5.  **Supportive Care:** The patient requires supportive care, including intravenous fluids, antihistamines, and corticosteroids to manage the anaphylactic shock.\n",
      "6.  **Education:** Educate the patient about tsetse fly prevention measures, such as using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and sleeping under insecticide-treated nets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The patient's history of a tick bite is less likely to be the cause of his illness, given the presence of trypanosomes in the blood smear.\n",
      "*   The anaphylactic shock is likely due to the invasive trypanosomes migrating from the chancre to the blood.\n",
      "*   The patient's \"allergic\" predisposition may have made him more susceptible to the effects of the trypanosomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis is **Human African Trypanosomiasis (East African), and the patient should be started on suramin treatment with close monitoring for side effects and central nervous system involvement.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Strongyloidiasis, specifically the hyperinfection syndrome form, due to HTLV-1 coinfection.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with chronic diarrhea, severe weight loss, and abdominal pain, all consistent with a parasitic infection causing malabsorption.\n",
      "*   **History:** The patient's origin from Peru, a region endemic for *Strongyloides stercoralis*, is a significant clue. The family history of abdominal symptoms and death in relatives also points towards a chronic parasitic infection.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The laboratory results show signs of malabsorption (low albumin, low protein) and inflammation (elevated ESR).\n",
      "*   **Histopathology:** The duodenal biopsy showing structures compatible with helminth infection strongly supports the presence of a parasitic infection.\n",
      "*   **Key Findings:** The presence of rhabditiform larvae in stool and respiratory secretions is highly suggestive of *Strongyloides stercoralis*. The confirmation of HTLV-1 coinfection is crucial, as it is a major risk factor for hyperinfection syndrome.\n",
      "*   **Differential Diagnosis:** While other parasitic infections (e.g., *Cryptosporidium*, *Cystoisospora*) could cause similar symptoms, the presence of rhabditiform larvae in both stool and respiratory secretions, along with the HTLV-1 coinfection, makes *Strongyloides stercoralis* hyperinfection syndrome the most likely diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis is **Strongyloidiasis, hyperinfection syndrome, due to HTLV-1 coinfection.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Further Investigations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Serology for HTLV-1:** Already performed and confirmed.\n",
      "*   **Repeat stool sample for Baermann test:** Already performed and positive.\n",
      "*   **Respiratory secretions for rhabditiform larvae:** Already performed and positive.\n",
      "*   **Consideration of other parasitic infections:** While less likely, other parasitic infections should be considered if the patient does not respond to treatment for *Strongyloides stercoralis* hyperinfection syndrome.\n",
      "*   **Consideration of other causes of malabsorption:** Although less likely given the clinical and parasitological findings, other causes of malabsorption should be considered if the patient does not respond to treatment for *Strongyloides stercoralis* hyperinfection syndrome.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Treatment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Ivermectin:** The drug of choice for *Strongyloides stercoralis* hyperinfection syndrome.\n",
      "*   **Albendazole:** Can be used in combination with ivermectin.\n",
      "*   **Broad-spectrum antibiotics:** To prevent Gram-negative infections.\n",
      "*   **Supportive care:** Including parenteral nutrition and fluid resuscitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The patient's condition is serious and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n",
      "*   Close monitoring is essential to assess the patient's response to treatment and to detect any signs of dissemination.\n",
      "*   Family members should be screened for both *Strongyloides stercoralis* and HTLV-1 infection.\n",
      "*   Patients originating from endemic countries should be screened for *Strongyloides stercoralis* infection before initiation of any immunosuppressive therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **cutaneous myiasis**, specifically **Tumbu fly myiasis** (Cordylobia anthropophaga).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Travel History:** The patient's recent travel to Ghana is a significant risk factor for myiasis, as the Tumbu fly is endemic to that region.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The description of the lesion (localized swelling, scab, pulsating end with transparent fluid) is highly suggestive of myiasis. The pulsating end with transparent fluid is a key indicator.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Systemic Symptoms:** The absence of fever or other systemic signs makes other infectious or inflammatory conditions less likely.\n",
      "*   **Itchiness:** The patient's report of itchiness is consistent with myiasis.\n",
      "*   **Treatment Response:** The successful removal of the maggot with forceps and the subsequent resolution of the lesion support the diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the approach would be to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Confirm the Diagnosis:** Gently remove the scab and examine the lesion under magnification to confirm the presence of a pulsating maggot.\n",
      "2.  **Treat the Myiasis:** Apply white petroleum jelly or liquid paraffin to the lesion to block the maggot's respiratory spiracles and deprive it of oxygen.\n",
      "3.  **Remove the Maggot:** Use forceps to carefully remove the maggot.\n",
      "4.  **Monitor for Complications:** Watch for signs of secondary infection.\n",
      "5.  **Provide Education:** Educate the patient about the risk of myiasis and how to prevent it in the future (e.g., avoiding lying on sandy ground, wearing shoes, using mosquito nets).\n",
      "\n",
      "Other considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   While less likely given the clinical picture, other possibilities to consider include a localized bacterial infection (e.g., furuncle, carbuncle) or a less common skin condition. However, the pulsating end with transparent fluid is a strong indicator of myiasis.\n",
      "*   If the diagnosis is uncertain, a skin biopsy could be considered to rule out other conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the clinical presentation strongly suggests Tumbu fly myiasis, and the appropriate management involves removing the maggot and applying petroleum jelly to the lesion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient is a 62-year-old Thai man with a solitary liver mass, no significant symptoms, and a markedly elevated CA19-9 level.\n",
      "*   **Imaging:** MRI shows a solid liver mass in the right lobe.\n",
      "*   **Pathology:** Histology confirms intrahepatic CCA.\n",
      "*   **Risk Factors:** The patient's origin in a region with high prevalence of liver fluke infection (Opisthorchis viverrini) and a history of praziquantel treatment (although not always effective in preventing re-infection) strongly suggests CCA.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** Elevated CA19-9 is a common marker for CCA.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC):** While HCC is a possibility, the presence of liver flukes in the bile duct and the patient's history make CCA more likely.\n",
      "*   **Metastatic Cancer:** This is a consideration, but the presence of liver flukes makes it less likely.\n",
      "*   **Other Liver Tumors:** Other types of liver tumors are less likely given the clinical and pathological findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Information to Obtain:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Detailed History of Liver Fluke Infection:** Specifically, when was the last treatment with praziquantel? How often does he eat raw or undercooked freshwater fish?\n",
      "*   **Family History:** Is there a family history of liver cancer or liver fluke infection?\n",
      "*   **Social History:** Alcohol consumption and smoking history.\n",
      "*   **Other Risk Factors:** Any other risk factors for liver cancer, such as chronic hepatitis B or C infection.\n",
      "*   **Further Imaging:** Consider further imaging studies, such as a CT scan or PET scan, to evaluate for metastasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the clinical picture, imaging findings, and pathology strongly suggest Cholangiocarcinoma, likely related to chronic liver fluke infection.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Brucellosis**, specifically complicated brucellosis with spondylitis and paravertebral abscess formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient's history of recurrent fever, night sweats, and progressive back pain, along with localized spinal tenderness, is highly suggestive of a chronic infectious process.\n",
      "*   **Imaging Findings:** The MRI showing signal enhancement of the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies, disc, and psoas muscle, along with disc space narrowing and irregularities of the vertebral endplates, is consistent with spondylodiscitis.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The slightly elevated CRP and ESR, along with negative blood cultures, are not uncommon in brucellosis. The negative sputum sample for acid-fast bacilli makes tuberculosis less likely.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location and History:** The patient's origin from Afghanistan, a region with a high prevalence of brucellosis, further strengthens the suspicion.\n",
      "*   **Diagnosis Confirmation:** The definitive diagnosis was confirmed by culture of the tissue sample revealing *Brucella melitensis*.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis is complicated brucellosis with spondylitis and paravertebral abscess formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Subarachnoid Neurocysticercosis (SANCC)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pathophysiology:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The pathophysiology of SANCC is primarily driven by the **inflammatory response** to the parasitic cysts in the subarachnoid space. The presence of the cysts triggers a significant inflammatory reaction, leading to:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Hydrocephalus:** The inflammation can obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), resulting in hydrocephalus (accumulation of CSF in the brain).\n",
      "*   **Vascular Involvement:** Inflammation can affect the blood vessels, leading to:\n",
      "    *   **Endarteritis:** Inflammation of the inner lining of the blood vessels.\n",
      "    *   **Aneurysm Formation:** Weakening and bulging of blood vessel walls.\n",
      "    *   **Thrombosis:** Blood clot formation within the vessels.\n",
      "    *   **Lacunar Infarcts:** Small strokes due to blockage of small blood vessels.\n",
      "*   **Meningitis:** Inflammation of the meninges (membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord).\n",
      "*   **Cerebrovascular Disease:** Overall increased risk of cerebrovascular events.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Approach to Diagnosis and Treatment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Diagnosis:**\n",
      "    *   **Imaging:** MRI is the preferred imaging modality for detecting subarachnoid cysts and assessing the extent of inflammation. CT can be used to detect parenchymal calcifications.\n",
      "    *   **Serology:** The immunoblot is the gold standard for detecting cysticercosis antibodies. A positive result is highly suggestive of SANCC. Serum cysticercosis antigen can also be used to monitor treatment response.\n",
      "    *   **Spinal MRI:** A spine MRI is recommended to rule out spinal involvement, which is common in SANCC.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Treatment:**\n",
      "    *   **Antiparasitic Therapy:** Dual therapy with albendazole and praziquantel is the standard treatment.\n",
      "    *   **Corticosteroids:** High-dose corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and prevent complications.\n",
      "    *   **Long-Term Management:** Treatment duration is typically longer than for parenchymal neurocysticercosis, often lasting several months or even years. Serial neuroimaging and serology are necessary to monitor treatment response and guide decision-making regarding discontinuation of therapy.\n",
      "    *   **Surgical Intervention:** In cases of severe hydrocephalus or other complications, surgical intervention (e.g., ventriculostomy) may be necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the patient's history, clinical presentation, and imaging findings are highly suggestive of SANCC. The diagnosis is confirmed by positive serology and imaging. Treatment involves antiparasitic therapy, corticosteroids, and long-term monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Paucibacillary Leprosy**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a hypopigmented macule on the right arm with reduced sensation, which is a classic sign of leprosy. The thickened ulnar nerve further supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "*   **Risk Factors:** The patient is from India, a region with a high prevalence of leprosy.\n",
      "*   **Treatment:** The patient was diagnosed with paucibacillary leprosy and treated with rifampicin and dapsone for 6 months, which is the standard treatment for this form of the disease.\n",
      "*   **Resolution:** The patient made a full recovery, which is consistent with successful treatment of leprosy.\n",
      "\n",
      "While other conditions can cause hypopigmentation, the combination of the clinical findings (hypopigmented macule, reduced sensation, thickened nerve) in an individual from a leprosy-endemic country strongly suggests leprosy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis is **Paucibacillary Leprosy**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Streptococcus suis meningitis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, neck stiffness, photophobia, and a petechial rash. These symptoms are highly suggestive of meningitis. The purpuric rash is particularly concerning and can be seen in severe cases of bacterial meningitis, especially with *Neisseria meningitidis* or *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. However, the presence of a petechial rash is more commonly associated with *Streptococcus suis* meningitis.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The CSF analysis shows a high white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance, elevated protein, and low glucose. This is consistent with bacterial meningitis. The negative Gram stain and India ink test make fungal meningitis less likely. The negative HSV PCR makes viral meningitis less likely.\n",
      "*   **Risk Factors:** The patient's occupation as a pig farmer and butcher in a local market significantly increases the risk of *Streptococcus suis* infection. Exposure to pigs and raw pork products is a known risk factor.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** Vietnam is an area where *Streptococcus suis* is endemic.\n",
      "*   **Culture Results:** The blood and CSF cultures grew *Streptococcus suis*, confirming the diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While *Streptococcus suis* is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities to consider include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Other Bacterial Meningitis:** *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Neisseria meningitidis*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, and *Listeria monocytogenes* are all potential causes of bacterial meningitis. However, the petechial rash is less common with these organisms.\n",
      "*   **Viral Meningitis:** While less likely given the CSF findings and the patient's risk factors, viral meningitis should still be considered.\n",
      "*   **Fungal Meningitis:** Less likely given the acute onset and the patient's risk factors.\n",
      "*   **Tuberculous Meningitis:** Less likely given the acute onset and the patient's risk factors.\n",
      "*   **Encephalitis:** The patient's symptoms could be due to encephalitis, but the CSF findings are more consistent with meningitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Empirical Treatment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the high suspicion for *Streptococcus suis* meningitis, the initial empirical treatment should include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Ceftriaxone:** A broad-spectrum cephalosporin that covers many common causes of bacterial meningitis.\n",
      "*   **Vancomycin:** Added to cover for penicillin-resistant *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.\n",
      "*   **Dexamethasone:** Considered in adults with suspected bacterial meningitis, particularly *Streptococcus pneumoniae* meningitis, to reduce the risk of neurological complications like hearing loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Investigations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Repeat Malaria Film and Rapid Diagnostic Tests:** To rule out malaria, given the patient's history and the presence of a petechial rash.\n",
      "*   **Blood Cultures:** To identify any other potential bloodstream infections.\n",
      "*   **Further Investigation of the Source of Infection:** Investigating the source of the *Streptococcus suis* infection (e.g., pig farm, pork products) is important to prevent further cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and risk factors, the most likely diagnosis is *Streptococcus suis* meningitis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with appropriate antibiotics, along with supportive care, are crucial for improving the patient's outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Yaws**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The description of a painless, non-healing leg ulcer with a crust, especially in a young person in the Solomon Islands, is highly suggestive of yaws. The presence of a satellite lesion is also a key indicator.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** A positive RPR test (at a titre of 1:64) is consistent with yaws.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** The Solomon Islands are a region where yaws remains endemic.\n",
      "*   **Treatment Response:** The patient's initial treatment with benzathine benzylpenicillin resulted in resolution of the skin lesion, which is typical of yaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Management and Follow-up:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Treatment:** The patient should be treated with a single intramuscular dose of benzathine benzylpenicillin (0.6 million units for children under 10 years, 1.2 million units for those 10 years and older). Azithromycin is also an acceptable alternative.\n",
      "2.  **Follow-up:** A four-fold fall in the RPR titre over 6 months is considered a sign of cure. The patient should be followed up to ensure this occurs. If the RPR titre does not fall sufficiently, further investigation and treatment may be necessary.\n",
      "3.  **Other Considerations:** While the initial ulcer is likely yaws, the persistence of the second ulcer on the other leg suggests a different etiology. Further investigation (e.g., skin biopsy, PCR) may be needed to rule out other possibilities, such as *Haemophilus ducreyi* infection (chancroid) or other bacterial infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the clinical picture and laboratory findings strongly point to yaws, and the recommended treatment and follow-up are appropriate.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the differential diagnoses and diagnostic tests:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The most likely differential diagnoses for this patient's persistent polyarthralgias, given his travel history and clinical presentation, are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Reactive Arthritis (Reiter's Syndrome):** This is a strong consideration, especially given the history of a preceding febrile illness and the symmetrical polyarthralgias. The lack of inflammatory signs on physical exam doesn't rule it out, as reactive arthritis can present with minimal or no inflammation.\n",
      "2.  **Viral Arthritis:** This is a broad category, but given the travel history and the persistence of symptoms, certain viral infections are more likely than others.\n",
      "    *   **Mayaro Virus (MAYV):** This is a key consideration, given the patient's travel to the Amazon Basin. MAYV is known to cause prolonged arthralgias.\n",
      "    *   **Chikungunya Virus:** While the patient's travel history doesn't place him in a high-risk area for Chikungunya at the time of his illness, it's still a possibility, especially if the virus was introduced to the Americas later.\n",
      "    *   **Other Alphaviruses:** Other alphaviruses like Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus, and O'Nyong Nyong virus are also possibilities, but less likely given the specific location and the patient's symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Diagnostic Tests:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The following diagnostic tests would be appropriate to investigate the patient's condition:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Serological Testing for Alphaviruses:** This is the most crucial step. Given the travel history and the possibility of Mayaro virus, testing for MAYV antibodies (IgM and IgG) is essential. Testing for other relevant alphaviruses (Chikungunya, Ross River, Barmah Forest, O'Nyong Nyong) should also be performed, as cross-reactivity can occur.\n",
      "2.  **Testing for Reactive Arthritis Markers:** If reactive arthritis is suspected, testing for HLA-B27 (although it's not always positive in reactive arthritis) and rheumatoid factor (RF) would be helpful.\n",
      "3.  **Testing for Other Infectious Agents:** While the initial tests were negative, it's important to consider other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. Testing for:\n",
      "    *   *Borrelia burgdorferi* (Lyme disease)\n",
      "    *   *Chlamydia trachomatis*\n",
      "    *   *Salmonella Typhi* and *S. Paratyphi* (typhoid fever)\n",
      "    *   *Parvovirus B19* (if the symptoms are more suggestive of a viral infection)\n",
      "    *   *Epstein-Barr virus* (EBV)\n",
      "    *   *Hepatitis B and C* (if there is a risk of exposure)\n",
      "4.  **Joint Fluid Analysis (if inflammation is present):** If there were any signs of inflammation in the joints (swelling, redness, effusion), joint fluid analysis would be helpful to rule out septic arthritis or other inflammatory conditions.\n",
      "5.  **Imaging Studies (if indicated):** If the diagnosis remains unclear, imaging studies such as X-rays or MRI of the affected joints may be considered to assess for structural damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the most important diagnostic test is serological testing for Mayaro virus, followed by testing for other relevant alphaviruses and reactive arthritis markers.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with fever, nausea, drowsiness, livedo reticularis, enlarged lymph node, and respiratory distress. These symptoms align with the typical presentation of SFTS.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** Elevated AST/ALT, LDH, CK, and low platelets are characteristic of SFTS.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** The patient lives in Kyushu, Japan, where SFTS cases have been reported.\n",
      "*   **Exposure History:** The patient's occupation (grape farming) and potential exposure to wild animals (boars, deer) increase the risk of tick bites, which are the primary mode of SFTS transmission.\n",
      "*   **Negative CRP:** A negative CRP is suggestive of SFTS rather than rickettsiosis.\n",
      "*   **Positive SFTS PCR:** The positive SFTS virus PCR confirms the diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While SFTS is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities to consider include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Rickettsial Infections:** Japanese spotted fever and scrub typhus are transmitted by mites and ticks, respectively, and can present with similar symptoms. However, the negative CRP makes rickettsiosis less likely.\n",
      "*   **Viral Infections:** Other viral infections could cause fever, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes.\n",
      "*   **Bacterial Infections:** Pneumonia, meningitis, or infective endocarditis could present with fever, altered mental status, and respiratory distress. However, the specific lab findings and the patient's history make these less likely.\n",
      "*   **Other Tick-Borne Diseases:** Other tick-borne diseases could be considered, but the clinical picture and lab results are more consistent with SFTS.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The management of SFTS involves:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Supportive Care:** Adequate fluid administration, respiratory support, and management of hypotension.\n",
      "*   **Monitoring:** Close monitoring of respiratory condition, blood pressure, platelet count, and liver function tests.\n",
      "*   **Thrombocytopenia Management:** Management of thrombocytopenia to prevent bleeding.\n",
      "*   **Hemophagocytic Syndrome Management:** Management of hemophagocytic syndrome if it develops.\n",
      "*   **Secondary Bacterial Infection Management:** Management of secondary bacterial infections.\n",
      "*   **Contact Precautions:** Contact precautions to prevent transmission to healthcare workers.\n",
      "*   **Antiviral Therapy:** There is no specific antiviral treatment for SFTS.\n",
      "*   **Consideration of Corticosteroids:** Hydrocortisone may be considered for refractory septic shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, based on the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, geographic location, and exposure history, the most likely diagnosis is Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS). Management should focus on supportive care, monitoring, and prevention of secondary complications.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the patient is a 30-year-old woman from Bolivia presenting with exertional dyspnea and palpitations. She has a history of living in a rural area during her childhood and has been living in an urban environment for the past 20 years. Her physical examination reveals sinus bradycardia with right bundle branch block on ECG and a moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray. Laboratory results are normal. Serological tests for Chagas disease are positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnosis:\n",
      "\n",
      "The most likely diagnosis is **Chagas cardiomyopathy**, a chronic manifestation of Chagas disease. The patient's symptoms (dyspnea, palpitations), ECG findings (sinus bradycardia with right bundle branch block), and chest X-ray findings (cardiomegaly) are consistent with this diagnosis. The positive serological tests further support this conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further Assessment and Management:\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the patient's intention to become pregnant, the following steps are crucial:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Complete Cardiological Evaluation:** A comprehensive evaluation of the heart is essential. This should include:\n",
      "    *   **Echocardiography:** To assess the size and function of the heart chambers, valve function, and presence of any structural abnormalities.\n",
      "    *   **Holter ECG Monitoring:** To evaluate for arrhythmias, especially sinus node dysfunction.\n",
      "    *   **Cardiac MRI:** To provide detailed anatomical and functional information about the heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Treatment of Chagas Cardiomyopathy:**\n",
      "    *   **Benznidazole or Nifurtimox:** These are the two trypanocidal drugs used to treat Chagas disease. Benznidazole is generally preferred due to a better safety profile.\n",
      "    *   **Dosage and Duration:** The standard treatment regimen involves 60 days of benznidazole 5 mg/kg per day.\n",
      "    *   **Monitoring:** Close monitoring for adverse effects is necessary during treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Management of Adverse Effects:**\n",
      "    *   **Hypersensitivity Reactions:** Skin rashes, fever, and eosinophilia are common side effects of benznidazole. These can be managed with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and, in severe cases, temporary discontinuation of the drug.\n",
      "    *   **Gastrointestinal Disturbances:** Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can occur. These can be managed with antiemetics and dietary modifications.\n",
      "    *   **Bone Marrow Suppression:** Benznidazole can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. This requires monitoring of blood counts and, in severe cases, temporary discontinuation of the drug.\n",
      "    *   **Peripheral Neuropathy:** Benznidazole can cause peripheral neuropathy, characterized by numbness, tingling, and pain in the extremities. This is a less common side effect but can be debilitating.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Pregnancy Considerations:**\n",
      "    *   **Treatment During Pregnancy:** Treatment of Chagas cardiomyopathy during pregnancy is controversial. The potential risks and benefits of treatment must be carefully weighed.\n",
      "    *   **Vertical Transmission:** Treatment of women of childbearing age is recommended to prevent vertical transmission of Chagas disease to the fetus.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Follow-up:**\n",
      "    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Regular follow-up with a cardiologist is essential to monitor cardiac function and assess for any signs of organ involvement.\n",
      "    *   **Cardiac Rehabilitation:** Cardiac rehabilitation may be beneficial for patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy.\n",

      "*   **CSF Findings:** The CSF findings (elevated protein, normal glucose, and increased cell count) can be seen in rabies, although they are not specific.\n",
      "*   **Autonomic Instability:** The development of autonomic instability (sweating, heart rate variability) is a common feature of paralytic rabies.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Mimics:** The clinical presentation is similar to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions.\n",

      "*   **Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS):** GBS can cause rapidly progressive ascending weakness and areflexia. However, the history of a dog bite and the presence of autonomic instability make GBS less likely.\n",
      "*   **Post-Vaccination Encephalomyelitis:** This is a rare complication of some vaccines, but it typically presents with encephalopathy (altered mental status) rather than primarily with weakness.\n",
      "*   **NMDAR Antibody-Mediated Encephalitis:** This autoimmune encephalitis can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, including weakness, but it is less likely given the history of a dog bite.\n",
      "*   **Campylobacter-Associated Summer Paralysis Syndrome:** This is a rare condition that can cause acute flaccid paralysis, but it is less likely given the history of a dog bite.\n",
      "*   **Other Encephalitides:** Other viral or bacterial infections that can cause encephalitis and paralysis should be considered.\n",
      "*   **Tetanus:** Tetanus can cause muscle rigidity and spasms, but it typically does not cause areflexia.\n",
      "*   **Snake or Scorpion Envenomation:** These envenomations can cause paralysis, but they typically have other characteristic features.\n",
      "*   **Organophosphate Poisoning:** This can cause cholinergic toxicity, which can cause muscle weakness, but it typically has other characteristic features.\n",
      "*   **Psychiatric Disorders:** Psychiatric disorders can sometimes cause neurological symptoms, but they typically do not cause rapidly progressive weakness and areflexia.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why Paralytic Rabies is the Most Likely Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the history of a dog bite, the rapid progression of weakness, the presence of areflexia, and the autonomic instability, paralytic rabies is the most likely diagnosis. The CSF findings are not specific, but they are consistent with rabies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Further Investigations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To confirm the diagnosis of paralytic rabies, the following investigations should be performed:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Saliva Samples:** Collect serial saliva samples at 3-6 hour intervals to test for rabies viral RNA by RT-PCR.\n",
      "*   **Nuchal Skin Biopsy:** Perform a nuchal skin biopsy for viral RNA by RT-PCR.\n",
      "*   **CSF Sample:** Collect a CSF sample for viral RNA by RT-PCR.\n",
      "*   **Brain Tissue:** If the patient survives, obtain brain tissue for dFA and RT-PCR.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Prevention:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient's lack of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) is a significant factor in his poor outcome. RIG is crucial for preventing rabies in individuals with severe exposures. The patient received a full course of active vaccine, but did not receive RIG.\n",

      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The fever, arthralgias, and retro-orbital pain are consistent with malaria.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The presence of Plasmodium species trophozoites in the blood smear, despite a negative rapid diagnostic test, strongly suggests malaria. The inability to identify the species on the thin film is a common challenge with Knowlesi malaria.\n",

      "\n",
      "    *   **Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHFs):** Dengue, Ebola, and other VHFs can cause similar symptoms. However, the negative dengue IgM and the lack of specific clinical features (e.g., severe thrombocytopenia, specific organ involvement) make them less likely.\n",
      "    *   **Leptospirosis:** While possible, the absence of significant renal impairment and the lack of a characteristic rash make it less likely.\n",
      "    *   **Brucellosis:** The negative Brucella serology makes this diagnosis less probable.\n",
      "    *   **Hepatitis:** While the patient has a history of hepatitis, the acute onset of severe symptoms and the presence of bleeding make this less likely.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Tests to Confirm the Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Yellow Fever IgM Capture ELISA:** This is the gold standard for confirming yellow fever infection. The positive result in this case is highly suggestive.\n",

      "*   **Opisthorchis:** This is less likely given the patient's location.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient's rapid clinical improvement and resolution of liver lesions after treatment with triclabendazole further support the diagnosis of fascioliasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)**, possibly with a component of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) overlap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a generalized mucocutaneous rash involving the skin and mucous membranes (lips, oral mucosa, conjunctivae, genital mucosa). The rash is described as maculopapular, non-itchy, and spares the palms and soles. The presence of hemorrhagic crusts on the lips and oral mucosa is highly suggestive of SJS/TEN.\n",
      "*   **Prodromal Symptoms:** The patient reports a cough, sore throat, and dysuria, which are common prodromal symptoms of SJS/TEN.\n",
      "*   **HIV Status:** The patient's HIV-positive status increases the risk of SJS/TEN, especially in resource-limited settings.\n",
      "*   **Medication History:** The recent initiation of nevirapine and co-trimoxazole is a significant risk factor for SJS/TEN.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Findings:** The patient's temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate are relatively stable, but the conjunctivitis and oral mucosal involvement are concerning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cause:** The most likely cause is a drug reaction, specifically to nevirapine and/or co-trimoxazole.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Approach:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Immediate Drug Withdrawal:** All potentially causative drugs (nevirapine and co-trimoxazole) should be immediately withdrawn.\n",
      "2.  **Supportive Care:** The patient requires supportive care, including:\n",
      "    *   Fluid and electrolyte management.\n",
      "    *   Pain control (opioids may be necessary).\n",
      "    *   Nutritional support (oral intake may be difficult, consider NG tube if needed).\n",
      "    *   Eye care (topical antiseptics and dexamethasone eye ointment for conjunctivitis).\n",
      "    *   Prevention of infection (urinary catheter to prevent urethral strictures).\n",
      "3.  **Monitoring:** Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory parameters (complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function) is essential.\n",
      "4.  **Consideration of Burns Unit:** Given the potential for significant epidermal detachment and fluid loss, the patient should be managed in a burns unit if available.\n",
      "5.  **Skin Biopsy:** A skin biopsy may be considered to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.\n",
      "6.  **Avoidance of culprit drug:** The patient should be advised to avoid the culprit drug and this should be clearly stated in the patient's documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Differential Diagnosis:** While SJS/TEN is the most likely diagnosis, other conditions such as toxic shock syndrome, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, and acute paraneoplastic pemphigus should be considered.\n",
      "*   **Resource-Limited Settings:** In resource-limited settings, it may be challenging to obtain laboratory results and manage patients with SJS/TEN. Close collaboration with specialists and access to appropriate resources are crucial.\n",
      "*   **Prognosis:** The prognosis of SJS/TEN depends on the severity of the condition, the patient's overall health, and access to appropriate care.\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Neurolathyrism**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a classic picture of neurolathyrism:\n",
      "    *   Young male farmer from rural Ethiopia.\n",
      "    *   Sudden onset of spastic paraparesis (difficulty walking) 10 years ago.\n",
      "    *   No sensory deficits or bladder dysfunction.\n",
      "    *   History of excessive consumption of *Lathyrus sativus* (grass pea) during a period of drought and famine.\n",
      "    *   Spastic gait with foot-dragging and toe-scraping.\n",
      "    *   No history of cassava exposure.\n",
      "*   **Risk Factors:** The patient has several risk factors for neurolathyrism:\n",
      "    *   Young age.\n",
      "    *   Male gender.\n",
      "    *   Prolonged physical exertion.\n",
      "    *   Monotonous diet consisting primarily of *Lathyrus sativus*.\n",
      "    *   History of similar cases in his village.\n",
      "*   **Exclusion of Other Diagnoses:** The patient's normal laboratory results (including HIV-1 serology and nerve conduction studies) help rule out other potential causes of spastic paraparesis, such as:\n",
      "    *   HTLV-1/2 myelopathy (less likely given the lack of sensory symptoms and the patient's age).\n",
      "    *   Neurocassavism (konzo) (less likely given the lack of cassava exposure).\n",
      "    *   Other metabolic or toxic causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses (and why they are less likely):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **HTLV-1/2 Myelopathy:** While possible, the absence of sensory symptoms and the patient's young age make this less likely. HTLV-1/2 myelopathy typically presents with a more insidious onset and often involves sensory deficits.\n",
      "*   **Neurocassavism (Konzo):** This is a possibility, but the lack of cassava exposure makes it less likely. Konzo is caused by the cassava brown-eye disease toxin, which is not present in *Lathyrus sativus*.\n",
      "*   **Spinal Cord Compression:** The absence of back pain, sensory level, and sphincter disturbance makes this less likely.\n",
      "*   **Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis:** While possible, the sudden onset and association with dietary factors make this less likely.\n",
      "*   **Other Toxic Myelopathies:** While other toxins can cause myelopathy, the specific history of *Lathyrus sativus* consumption strongly points to neurolathyrism.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Management and Prevention:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The management and prevention plan for neurolathyrism focuses on:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Education:** Educating communities about the risks of excessive *Lathyrus sativus* consumption.\n",
      "*   **Behavioral Changes:** Promoting alternative food sources and dietary practices to reduce toxin burden.\n",
      "*   **Public Health Interventions:** Implementing measures to reduce toxin exposure, such as:\n",
      "    *   Using metallic cooking utensils instead of clay pots.\n",
      "    *   Adding antioxidant seasonings to food.\n",
      "    *   Soaking seeds in lemon water.\n",
      "    *   Avoiding unripe seeds.\n",
      "*   **Symptomatic Treatment:** Providing physiotherapy, muscle relaxants, and assistive devices (walking canes, wheelchairs) to manage symptoms.\n",
      "*   **Surgery:** In severe cases, tendon and muscle release surgery may be considered to improve mobility.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the clinical presentation, risk factors, and exclusion of other diagnoses, the most likely diagnosis is neurolathyrism. A comprehensive management and prevention plan is crucial to address this preventable neurotoxic myelopathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Urogenital Schistosomiasis**, specifically caused by *Schistosoma haematobium*.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Patient Profile:** A young male fisherman from Malawi, a region endemic for *Schistosoma haematobium*.\n",
      "*   **Symptoms:** Shortness of breath, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, bilateral flank pain, nausea, and renal angle tenderness.\n",
      "*   **Physical Findings:** Pale conjunctivae, hypertension (200/130 mmHg), elevated creatinine (1200 μmol/L), hyperkalaemia (7.2 mmol/L), bilateral fine crackles in the lungs, and enlarged kidneys with hydronephrosis.\n",
      "*   **Imaging:** Chest radiograph showing bilateral infiltrates, and ultrasound revealing bilateral hydronephrosis with massive dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces, and thin renal parenchyma.\n",
      "*   **Cystoscopy:** Hyperaemic mucosa with \"sandy patches\" suggestive of granulomatous lesions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of these factors strongly points towards urogenital schistosomiasis. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and renal failure are consistent with the complications of chronic schistosomiasis, such as hydronephrosis and obstructive uropathy. The \"sandy patches\" seen on cystoscopy are a characteristic finding in urogenital schistosomiasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Further Investigations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Ultrasound of the Kidneys:** To confirm hydronephrosis, assess the degree of renal damage, and rule out other causes of renal failure.\n",
      "2.  **Cystoscopy:** To visualize the bladder mucosa and confirm the presence of \"sandy patches.\"\n",
      "3.  **Urine Analysis:** To look for *Schistosoma haematobium* eggs, although this may be negative in chronic cases.\n",
      "4.  **Histology of Bladder Biopsy:** If available, to confirm the diagnosis by identifying *Schistosoma haematobium* eggs and granulomatous inflammation.\n",
      "5.  **Blood Tests:** To assess for other possible causes of renal failure, such as glomerulonephritis or pyelonephritis.\n",
      "6.  **HIV Testing:** To rule out HIV as a contributing factor to the patient's condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are highly suggestive of urogenital schistosomiasis. Further investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided clinical presentation and information, the most likely diagnosis is **Scrub Typhus**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** The patient is from Sri Lanka, an endemic area for scrub typhus.\n",
      "*   **Symptoms:** The combination of fever, headache, myalgia, regional lymphadenopathy, and hearing loss is highly suggestive of scrub typhus.\n",
      "*   **Physical Findings:** The presence of a crater-like lesion in the axilla, even if not immediately apparent, is a key finding.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** While the initial CSF results are not definitive, the clinical picture strongly points towards scrub typhus.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Course:** The patient's improvement with doxycycline treatment further supports the diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis is **Scrub Typhus**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Paragonimiasis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient is a 71-year-old Japanese man with a nodular lesion in the lung, eosinophilia, and elevated IgE levels. These findings are highly suggestive of Paragonimiasis.\n",
      "*   **Imaging:** The PET-CT scan showing increased FDG uptake in the lesion further supports the possibility of an infectious or inflammatory process.\n",
      "*   **Exposure History:** The patient's origin from Japan, a region where Paragonimiasis is endemic, is a significant clue. The history of eating raw or undercooked freshwater crabs is a major risk factor for Paragonimiasis.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The positive multiple-dot ELISA for *P. westermani* confirms the diagnosis.\n",
      "*   **Treatment Response:** The patient's clinical improvement after praziquantel treatment is consistent with Paragonimiasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis is **Paragonimiasis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Kwashiorkor**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The child presents with generalized edema, skin lesions (peeling, ulcerations), hyperpigmentation, hair changes (brittle, sparse, fair), apathy, and poor appetite. These are all classic signs of Kwashiorkor.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** Low albumin and hemoglobin levels are consistent with Kwashiorkor.\n",
      "*   **History:** The child is from a region where a monotonous diet (e.g., maize, cassava) is common, which is a risk factor for Kwashiorkor. The history of pneumonia further supports the possibility of an infection preceding the onset of Kwashiorkor.\n",
      "*   **Distinguishing from Nephrotic Syndrome:** While both conditions cause edema, the key differences lie in the underlying cause and other clinical features. In nephrotic syndrome, the primary problem is excessive protein loss in the urine (proteinuria), leading to low albumin. In Kwashiorkor, the primary problem is severe protein deficiency, leading to low albumin and edema. The skin changes (peeling, hyperpigmentation), hair changes, and apathy are not typical of nephrotic syndrome. The urine dipstick test in nephrotic syndrome would show significant proteinuria (4+), while in Kwashiorkor, it would likely be less than 1+.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Therefore, the diagnosis is Kwashiorkor.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Acute Schistosomiasis (Katayama Syndrome)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Travel History:** The patient's travel to Mozambique, particularly the freshwater contact, is a significant risk factor for schistosomiasis.\n",
      "*   **Symptoms:** The fever, headache, and diarrhoea are consistent with Katayama syndrome.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The eosinophilia is a key finding, strongly suggestive of a parasitic infection. The negative stool and urine samples for Schistosoma eggs initially are not uncommon in the early stages of the disease.\n",
      "*   **Chest Radiography:** The nodular changes in the lungs are also consistent with Katayama syndrome.\n",
      "*   **Delayed Serology:** The negative initial serological tests are typical of Katayama syndrome, as the antibodies may not be detectable early in the infection. The positive serology later on confirms the diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis is Acute Schistosomiasis (Katayama Syndrome).\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Cryptococcal Meningitis (CM)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a sub-acute headache, blurred vision, and an abducens nerve palsy (left lateral gaze deficit). These are classic symptoms of CM, particularly in the context of HIV.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The patient has normocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are common findings in HIV infection and can be exacerbated by CM. The elevated CSF opening pressure is also suggestive of CM.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** Malawi has a high prevalence of HIV, making CM a significant concern.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Response to Treatment:** The patient's lack of response to antimalarial and antibiotic treatment further supports the diagnosis of CM, as these medications are ineffective against the fungal infection.\n",
      "*   **Positive HIV Serology:** The positive HIV serology confirms the patient's immunocompromised state, making her susceptible to opportunistic infections like CM.\n",
      "*   **Low CD4 Count:** The very low CD4 count (22/μL) indicates advanced HIV infection, which is a major risk factor for CM.\n",
      "*   **CSF Findings:** The CSF results, including the elevated opening pressure and the presence of the fungus (although India Ink was negative), are consistent with CM.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM):** TBM can present with similar symptoms, but the absence of fever and neck stiffness makes it less likely.\n",
      "*   **Bacterial Meningitis:** While possible, the gradual onset of symptoms and lack of response to antibiotics make this less probable.\n",
      "*   **Malaria:** Malaria can cause headache and anemia, but the unilateral abducens nerve palsy and lack of fever make it less likely.\n",
      "*   **Other Meningitides:** Other bacterial or viral causes of meningitis are less likely given the clinical context.\n",

      "*   **CD4 Count:** Already performed and very low.\n",
      "*   **Consider other investigations** if the diagnosis is uncertain, such as CT or MRI of the brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Treatment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Antifungal Therapy:** The patient should be started on oral fluconazole (1200 mg daily) or, if available, liposomal amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.\n",
      "*   **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):** ART should be initiated as soon as possible, ideally 4-10 weeks after starting antifungal treatment.\n",
      "*   **Lumbar Punctures:** Therapeutic lumbar punctures may be necessary to reduce intracranial pressure and relieve headache.\n",
      "*   **Supportive Care:** Supportive care, including hydration and management of complications, is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient's presentation strongly suggests Cryptococcal Meningitis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with appropriate antifungal therapy and ART are crucial to improve her prognosis.\n",
      "\n",

      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with acute onset of flaccid paraplegia, sensory level at T10, and urinary incontinence. This is a classic presentation of a spinal cord lesion.\n",
      "*   **History:** The history of a febrile illness 3 weeks prior is a significant clue, as infections are a common cause of ATM.\n",
      "*   **Neurological Examination:** The neurological exam findings (flaccid paraparesis, sensory level, extensor plantar reflexes) strongly support a spinal cord lesion.\n",
      "*   **CSF Findings:** The CSF analysis showing increased lymphocytes and elevated protein is consistent with inflammation within the spinal cord.\n",
      "*   **Imaging:** While spinal imaging (CT/MRI) is ideal, it's often not readily available in resource-limited settings. The absence of a compressive lesion on chest X-ray and spinal X-ray doesn't rule out ATM, as the lesion may be within the spinal cord itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While ATM is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities should be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Spinal Cord Ischemia:** This is less likely given the history of a recent infection and the CSF findings.\n",
      "*   **Metastatic Cancer:** This is less likely given the acute onset and lack of a known primary cancer.\n",
      "*   **Schistosomiasis:** This is a possibility, especially in endemic areas, but the CSF findings are more suggestive of inflammation.\n",
      "*   **Guillain-Barré Syndrome:** This typically presents with ascending weakness and areflexia, not a sensory level.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investigations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigations listed in the discussion are appropriate to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Full Blood Count (FBC):** To assess for infection or other systemic illness.\n",
      "*   **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):** To assess for inflammation.\n",
      "*   **Blood Glucose:** To rule out diabetes.\n",
      "*   **Renal and Liver Function Tests (LFTs):** To assess for organ damage.\n",

      "Therefore, the diagnosis of Hyperreactive Malarial Splenomegaly (HMS) is the most likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the patient's diagnosis is **Cerebral Sparganosis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and weakness of the right lower extremity. This is a common presentation for a space-occupying lesion in the brain.\n",
      "*   **Imaging Findings:** The MRI shows a ring-enhancing, tunnel-shaped lesion in the left occipital lobe. This is a classic finding in cerebral sparganosis, often referred to as the \"tunnel sign.\"\n",
      "*   **Surgical Findings:** During surgery, a live worm-like structure is removed from the brain, identified as a sparganum. This confirms the diagnosis.\n",
      "*   **History:** The patient's history of eating raw chicken meat approximately once a month is a significant risk factor for sparganosis, as it can be acquired by ingesting the first or second intermediate host.\n",
      "*   **Treatment:** The treatment of choice is the removal of the sparganum from the brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the combination of clinical presentation, imaging findings, surgical findings, and history strongly suggests cerebral sparganosis.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Giardiasis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Travel History:** The patient is a traveler to India, a region known to have a higher prevalence of Giardia.\n",
      "*   **Symptoms:** The patient presents with classic Giardiasis symptoms:\n",
      "    *   Diarrhea (loose stools, four or five episodes per day)\n",
      "    *   Flatulence\n",
      "    *   Abdominal cramping\n",
      "    *   Bloating and distension after milk consumption\n",
      "    *   Weight loss and anorexia\n",
      "    *   Greasy, foul-smelling stools\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The presence of Giardia trophozoites and cysts in the stool sample confirms the diagnosis.\n",
      "*   **Response to Treatment:** The patient's symptoms improved after taking tinidazole, a common treatment for Giardiasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Differential Diagnosis:** While Giardiasis is the most likely diagnosis, other causes of infectious diarrhea should be considered, especially if the patient does not respond to treatment. These include:\n",
      "    *   *Cryptosporidium*\n",
      "    *   *Entamoeba histolytica*\n",
      "    *   *Campylobacter*\n",
      "    *   *Shigella*\n",
      "    *   *Salmonella*\n",
      "    *   *E. coli* (various strains)\n",
      "*   **Complications:** Giardiasis can lead to malabsorption, particularly of fats and carbohydrates, which can contribute to weight loss and nutritional deficiencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the clinical presentation, travel history, and laboratory findings strongly suggest Giardiasis as the cause of the patient's diarrhea.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the clinical presentation and the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Noma**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Age:** Noma primarily affects children aged 1 to 7 years.\n",
      "*   **Location:** The lesion is on the face, specifically the lip and cheek.\n",
      "*   **Rapid Progression:** The lesion progressed quickly from a sore to eating through the cheek.\n",
      "*   **Symptoms:** Bad breath, listlessness, and the child's appearance (small, quiet, stunted, thin) are consistent with Noma.\n",
      "*   **History:** The child is unimmunized, had a fever and rash about 2 months ago, and lives in a poor area. These factors increase the risk of Noma.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Recognition:** The local doctors do not recognize the disease, which is common in areas where Noma is prevalent.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Findings:** The gangrenous lesion destroying tissue is a hallmark of Noma.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While Noma is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities to consider include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Oral Cancer:** Less likely in a 4-year-old.\n",
      "*   **Syphilis:** Less likely in a young child without a known history of exposure.\n",
      "*   **Yaws:** Less likely in a child who has not been vaccinated.\n",
      "*   **Cutaneous Leishmaniasis:** Less likely to develop at such a rapid pace and be so destructive.\n",
      "*   **Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis:** Possible, but less common in Laos.\n",
      "*   **Tooth Abscess and Cellulitis:** Possible initially, but the rapid progression and extent of tissue destruction are more suggestive of Noma.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Treatment:**\n",
      "    *   **Antibiotics:** Penicillin and metronidazole to cover the suspected aerobic and anaerobic oropharyngeal bacteria.\n",
      "    *   **Nutritional Support:** Crucial for survival and healing. Liquid foods (eggs, milk, soy products, peanuts) should be provided orally or enterally.\n",
      "    *   **Treat Underlying Infections:** Look for and treat malaria, intestinal parasites, tuberculosis, and vitamin deficiencies.\n",
      "    *   **Remove Necrotic Tissue:** To prevent further spread of infection.\n",
      "    *   **Physiotherapy:** To prevent contractures during healing.\n",
      "    *   **Reconstructive Surgery:** Should be delayed for at least 1 year to allow for healing and to improve the outcome. The surgery should be performed by an experienced surgical team.\n",
      "    *   **Improve Nutrition Before Surgery:** If surgery is necessary, improving the child's nutritional status beforehand can improve the outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Support:**\n",
      "    *   **Psychosocial Support:** Survivors of noma suffer from disfigurement, functional problems with speech and eating, and psychosocial isolation. They may present as young adults seeking help.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Prevention:**\n",
      "    *   **Address Poverty:** The elimination of extreme poverty is essential to prevent Noma.\n",
      "    *   **Prenatal Care:** Provide prenatal care to mothers.\n",
      "    *   **Exclusive Breastfeeding:** Promote exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life.\n",
      "    *   **Immunizations:** Ensure that children are fully immunized.\n",
      "    *   **Food Security:** Improve food security.\n",
      "    *   **Improved Nutrition:** Provide adequate nutrition for the poorest children.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the child likely has Noma, and the priority is to provide aggressive treatment with antibiotics, nutritional support, and address any underlying infections. Reconstructive surgery should be delayed until the child is well-nourished and the infection is under control.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Cystic Echinococcosis (CE)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Patient History:** The patient is a 24-year-old man of Turkish origin, which is a risk factor for CE, particularly in regions with high endemicity. He has a history of right upper quadrant pain and jaundice, which are common symptoms of CE.\n",
      "*   **Imaging Findings:** The ultrasound and CT scans show two cystic lesions in the liver, with calcified cyst walls. This is a characteristic finding in CE, especially in later stages.\n",
      "*   **Serology:** Positive serology for *Echinococcus granulosus* supports the diagnosis of CE.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Course:** The patient's initial presentation with right upper quadrant pain and jaundice, followed by the diagnosis of CE three years prior, and the subsequent finding of a cystobiliary fistula during ERC, is consistent with the typical progression of CE.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Approach to the Patient:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Confirm Diagnosis:** While the history, imaging, and serology are suggestive, a definitive diagnosis requires confirmation. This can be done through:\n",
      "    *   **Diagnostic cyst puncture and aspiration:** This involves inserting a needle into the cyst to collect fluid for analysis.\n",
      "    *   **MRI with contrast:** This can help differentiate between CE and other cystic liver lesions.\n",
      "2.  **Assess Cyst Stage:** The WHO classification of CE cysts (CE1, CE2, CE3a, CE3b, CE4, CE5) is important for determining the appropriate treatment strategy. The presence of calcification suggests a later stage.\n",
      "3.  **Evaluate for Complications:** The presence of a cystobiliary fistula is a significant complication that can lead to biliary obstruction and cholangitis.\n",
      "4.  **Treatment:**\n",
      "    *   **Cystobiliary Fistula:** The patient's presentation with a cystobiliary fistula and cholangitis necessitates prompt intervention. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) was used to remove the cyst content from the common bile duct and restore biliary flow. Antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and metronidazole) were administered to treat the cholangitis.\n",
      "    *   **Surgical Treatment:** After the biliary obstruction was resolved, the patient underwent partial cystectomy to remove the cysts.\n",
      "5.  **Follow-up:** Long-term follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence of the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Congenital Simple Hepatic Cyst:** These are common, benign cysts that are usually asymptomatic. They are typically not associated with calcification or a cystobiliary fistula.\n",
      "*   **Pseudocyst:** These are collections of fluid and debris that can occur after liver trauma or surgery. They are not typically associated with calcification or a cystobiliary fistula.\n",
      "*   **Infectious Abscess:** These are collections of pus that can occur due to bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infections. They are typically associated with fever, pain, and elevated inflammatory markers.\n",
      "*   **Tuberculoma:** These are granulomas that can occur in the liver due to tuberculosis infection. They are typically associated with fever, weight loss, and night sweats.\n",
      "*   **Benign and Malignant Liver Tumors:** These can present as cystic lesions, but they are less likely to be associated with calcification or a cystobiliary fistula.\n",
      "*   **Other parasitic infections:** Other parasitic infections can cause liver cysts, but they are less common than CE.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the patient's presentation is highly suggestive of cystic echinococcosis with a cystobiliary fistula. Prompt diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up are essential to prevent complications and improve the patient's outcome.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a slowly progressive, half-sided weakness (hemiparesis) and sensory loss. This is a classic presentation of PML.\n",
      "*   **HIV Status:** The patient is HIV-positive, which is a significant risk factor for PML.\n",
      "*   **CD4 Count:** The patient's CD4 count of 54/μL is low, indicating significant immunosuppression, which is a prerequisite for PML development.\n",
      "*   **Timeframe:** The onset of symptoms was approximately 3 months prior to presentation, and the patient was diagnosed with TB 5 months prior. The time frame is consistent with PML.\n",
      "*   **MRI Findings:** The MRI findings of multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions in the white matter, particularly in the subcortical regions, are highly suggestive of PML. The \"U-fibers\" appearance is also characteristic.\n",
      "*   **Exclusion of Other Diagnoses:** The normal CSF, negative India Ink and fungal cultures, and the absence of mass effect or contrast enhancement on CT make other diagnoses like toxoplasmosis, cryptococcoma, and cerebral TB less likely.\n",
      "*   **IRIS:** The patient's clinical deterioration after starting ART raises the possibility of PML-IRIS.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While PML is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities to consider include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Tuberculoma:** TB can cause focal lesions in the brain, but the MRI findings are more typical of PML.\n",
      "*   **Toxoplasmosis:** This is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive individuals, but the MRI findings are usually different.\n",
      "*   **Cryptococcoma:** This is another opportunistic infection, but the MRI findings are usually different.\n",
      "*   **CNS Lymphoma:** This is a less common but important consideration in HIV-positive individuals.\n",
      "*   **Stroke:** While possible, the slow progression and MRI findings make this less likely.\n",
      "*   **Other causes of focal lesions:** Brain tumor, cerebral abscess, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Diagnostic Approach in a Resource-Limited Setting:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the limited resources, the diagnostic approach would likely involve:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Clinical Evaluation:** A thorough neurological examination and history taking are crucial.\n",
      "2.  **HIV Testing:** Confirming the HIV status and CD4 count.\n",
      "3.  **MRI:** If available, MRI is the most valuable imaging modality for diagnosing PML.\n",
      "4.  **CSF Analysis:** Although often normal, CSF analysis can be helpful in excluding other diagnoses.\n",
      "5.  **Other Investigations:** Chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound to rule out TB.\n",
      "6.  **Treatment:** Empiric treatment for PML (e.g., ART, corticosteroids) should be initiated based on clinical suspicion and MRI findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the clinical presentation, HIV status, CD4 count, and MRI findings, PML is the most likely diagnosis. A definitive diagnosis can be confirmed with a brain biopsy, but this is not always necessary, especially in resource-limited settings. Treatment should be initiated promptly based on clinical suspicion and MRI findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Oroya Fever (Bartonellosis)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Patient Profile:** A 56-year-old male from Peru.\n",
      "*   **Exposure History:** Recent travel to the highlands of Peru, where sandflies (vectors of Bartonella) are present.\n",
      "*   **Symptoms:** Prolonged fever, jaundice, confusion, and severe anemia.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** Massive red blood cell infestation with cocco-bacillary structures on thin smear.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Course:** The patient progressed to shock, requiring vasopressors, and responded to antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone).\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of these factors strongly suggests Oroya Fever, a severe form of Bartonellosis transmitted by sandflies. The presence of verruga peruana (the chronic cutaneous stage) is also consistent with this diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Differential Diagnoses:\n",
      "\n",
      "While malaria is a possibility given the fever and travel history, the negative malaria smears and the presence of cocco-bacillary structures on the thin smear make it less likely. Other possibilities include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Rickettsial diseases:** (e.g., typhus) - Less likely given the specific findings on the thin smear.\n",
      "*   **Leptospirosis:** Less likely given the specific findings on the thin smear.\n",
      "*   **Typhoid fever:** Less likely given the specific findings on the thin smear.\n",
      "*   **Brucellosis:** Less likely given the specific findings on the thin smear.\n",
      "*   **Viral hepatitis:** Less likely given the specific findings on the thin smear.\n",
      "*   **Yellow fever:** Less likely given the specific findings on the thin smear.\n",
      "*   **Non-infectious causes of haemolysis:** Less likely given the specific findings on the thin smear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Confirm Diagnosis:** The thin smear showing cocco-bacillary structures is crucial for confirming the diagnosis of Oroya Fever.\n",
      "2.  **Start Treatment:** Initiate antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone, as recommended for severe cases.\n",
      "3.  **Monitor Response:** Closely monitor the patient's response to treatment, including fever, mental status, and blood counts.\n",
      "4.  **Consider Complications:** Be prepared to manage potential complications such as heart failure, opportunistic infections, and the development of verruga peruana.\n",
      "5.  **Provide Supportive Care:** Provide supportive care, including fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions, as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and exposure history, the most likely diagnosis is Oroya Fever (Bartonellosis).\n",

      "    *   Recent death of a husband from a similar febrile illness in a gold mine.\n",
      "    *   The fact that the husband worked in a gold mine is a significant clue, as MVD has been associated with mines.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** Uganda is an endemic area for MVD, as indicated in the figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Exposure History:** The husband's work in a gold mine raises suspicion for zoonotic transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Rapid Progression and High Mortality:** The rapid progression of the illness and the patient's deteriorating condition are consistent with MVD.\n",
      "\n",

      "*   **Other Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers:** Other viruses that can cause hemorrhagic fever, such as Lassa fever, should be considered, but are less likely given the specific context.\n",
      "*   **Severe Bacterial Sepsis:** While less likely given the conjunctivitis and the husband's death, bacterial sepsis should be considered, especially in a rural setting with limited access to healthcare.\n",
      "*   **Malaria:** Malaria is a common cause of fever and illness in Uganda, but the conjunctivitis and the husband's death make it less likely.\n",
      "*   **Typhoid Fever:** Typhoid fever can cause fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, but conjunctivitis is not a typical feature.\n",

      "1.  **Isolation:** The patient was isolated in a side room to prevent nosocomial spread.\n",
      "2.  **Strict Infection Control:** Protective measures (gloves, gowns) were used during patient care.\n",
      "3.  **Minimizing Invasive Procedures:** Invasive procedures were minimized to reduce the risk of transmission.\n",
      "4.  **Malaria Testing:** A malaria slide was performed, but the positive result did not rule out VHF.\n",
      "5.  **PCR Testing:** PCR testing for MVD and Ebola was performed on a sample of the patient's blood.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Travel History:** The patient's recent travel to South Africa, specifically KwaZulu-Natal, is a significant risk factor for ATBF.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The presence of a necrotic skin lesion (eschar) with surrounding inflammation and lymphadenopathy is highly characteristic of ATBF. The eschar is a hallmark of the disease.\n",
      "*   **Symptoms:** The patient's fever, headache, and night sweats are consistent with the typical symptoms of ATBF.\n",
      "*   **Negative Malaria Test:** The negative malaria test rules out malaria as the primary cause of the fever.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Diagnosis Confirmation:** While the clinical presentation is suggestive, PCR from the eschar scab or a skin swab can confirm the diagnosis.\n",
      "2.  **Treatment:** Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 3-7 days is the recommended treatment for ATBF.\n",
      "3.  **Supportive Care:** Rest, hydration, and antipyretics (like paracetamol) can help manage symptoms.\n",
      "4.  **Monitoring:** Monitor the patient for any signs of neurological involvement (encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, retinitis, panuveitis).\n",
      "5.  **Prevention:** Advise the patient to avoid tick bites in the future by wearing long sleeves and pants, using insect repellent, and checking for ticks after outdoor activities.\n",

      "*   **Lack of other symptoms:** The absence of lymphadenopathy and jaundice makes other diagnoses less likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact on Pregnancy:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Syphilis in pregnancy can lead to:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Stillbirth:** A significant risk, especially in untreated cases.\n",
      "*   **Low birth weight:** Increased risk of low birth weight infants.\n",
      "*   **Congenital syphilis:** If the mother is infected during pregnancy, the baby can be born with congenital syphilis, which can cause a variety of problems, including a rash, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone involvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The recommended management is:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Benzathine penicillin:** A single intramuscular dose of 2.4 million units is the treatment of choice.\n",
      "2.  **Treatment before 28 weeks:** Treatment before 28 weeks of gestation is recommended to prevent adverse outcomes for the fetus.\n",
      "3.  **Congenital syphilis treatment:** The infant should receive a course of procaine penicillin (50,000 units/kg daily for 10-14 days) after birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient likely has secondary syphilis. Prompt treatment with benzathine penicillin is crucial to prevent serious complications for both the mother and the fetus. The infant will also require treatment for congenital syphilis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is **Hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis** leading to **Portal Hypertension and Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (Haematemesis)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with haematemesis, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia. These findings are highly suggestive of portal hypertension.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** The patient is from Malawi, a region known to be endemic for schistosomiasis.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Results:** Pancytopenia (low counts of all blood cell types) is a common finding in schistosomiasis due to the parasite's effect on the bone marrow.\n",
      "*   **Ultrasound Findings:** The description of \"pipestem fibrosis\" on ultrasound is a characteristic finding in advanced hepatosplenic schistosomiasis.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Other Explanations:** The patient has no history of NSAID use, alcohol abuse, or other common causes of upper GI bleeding. Her HIV status is negative, making HIV-related complications less likely.\n",
      "*   **Treatment Response:** The patient responded to praziquantel treatment, further supporting the diagnosis of schistosomiasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the combination of clinical findings, geographic location, and ultrasound results strongly points to hepatosplenic schistosomiasis as the underlying cause of her haematemesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Intestinal Capillariasis** caused by *Capillaria philippinensis*.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reasoning:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient's symptoms (severe chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, weight loss, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, lower limb swelling, and prostration) are highly suggestive of intestinal capillariasis.\n",
      "*   **Stool Microscopy:** The presence of \"peanut-shaped helminth ova\" in the stool is a key diagnostic finding for *Capillaria philippinensis*. The description of the ova (protruding polar plugs, 36-42 μm) is also consistent with this parasite.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** The patient's origin in Egypt is relevant, as *Capillaria philippinensis* is endemic in various regions, including Egypt, Iran, and India.\n",
      "*   **Transmission:** The information about transmission through consumption of raw or undercooked fish supports the diagnosis of intestinal capillariasis.\n",
      "*   **Treatment Response:** The improvement in the patient's condition after albendazole treatment further strengthens the diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While other conditions could cause similar symptoms, the combination of the ova morphology, geographic location, and transmission route makes *Capillaria philippinensis* the most probable cause. Other possibilities to consider, but less likely, include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Other helminth infections (e.g., *Ascaris lumbricoides*, *Strongyloides stercoralis*)\n",
      "*   Protozoal infections (e.g., *Giardia lamblia*, *Cryptosporidium parvum*)\n",
      "*   Bacterial infections\n",
      "*   Malabsorption syndromes (e.g., celiac disease)\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the clinical presentation, microscopic findings, and epidemiological context strongly point to intestinal capillariasis caused by *Capillaria philippinensis*.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with widespread dark purplish skin lesions (plaques) on the skin and palate, along with shortness of breath and cough. This is a classic presentation of KS.\n",
      "*   **HIV Status:** The patient is HIV-positive, which is a significant risk factor for KS.\n",
      "*   **Chest Radiograph:** The chest radiograph shows bilateral peribronchovascular infiltration, which is consistent with pulmonary KS.\n",
      "*   **Negative TB Tests:** The negative sputum and GeneXpert tests for tuberculosis make TB less likely, although it's still important to consider.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Improvement with Antibiotics:** The lack of improvement with oral antibiotics further supports the diagnosis of KS.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While KS is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities to consider include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Tuberculosis (TB):** Although less likely given the negative TB tests, TB should still be considered, especially in resource-limited settings where TB is prevalent.\n",
      "*   **Other Infections:** Other opportunistic infections could potentially cause similar skin lesions and respiratory symptoms, but these are less likely given the patient's HIV status and the characteristic appearance of the lesions.\n",
      "*   **Drug Reaction:** A drug reaction could cause skin lesions and respiratory symptoms, but this is less likely without a known history of drug exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Approach:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Confirm KS Diagnosis:** A biopsy of the skin lesions is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of KS.\n",
      "2.  **Start Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):** The patient should be started on ART as soon as possible to control the HIV infection and potentially improve the response to KS treatment.\n",
      "3.  **Palliative Chemotherapy:** Given the patient's pulmonary involvement, palliative chemotherapy is indicated to manage the KS and improve his quality of life.\n",
      "4.  **Address Patient Concerns:** The patient's main concern is shortness of breath. His wife is also HIV-positive and not on ART, and his two children have not yet been tested. These issues should be addressed.\n",
      "5.  **Supportive Care:** Provide supportive care, including pain management, respiratory support, and psychological support.\n",
      "6.  **Referral:** Consider referral to a specialist in KS for further management.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Drug Availability and Access:** The availability and access to ART and chemotherapeutic agents may be limited in Malawi.\n",
      "*   **Side Effects of Chemotherapy:** The potential side effects of chemotherapy should be carefully considered.\n",
      "*   **Quality of Life:** The goal of care should be to improve the patient's quality of life and provide holistic palliative care.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the patient's presentation is highly suggestive of Kaposi's Sarcoma, and a prompt diagnosis and treatment plan are essential.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Gnathostomiasis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Travel History:** The patient's recent travel to the Okavango Delta in Botswana is a significant clue. Gnathostomiasis is endemic in areas where raw or undercooked freshwater fish and crustaceans are consumed.\n",
      "*   **Symptoms:** The patient's symptoms align with the classic presentation of gnathostomiasis:\n",
      "    *   Mobile, itchy mass under the skin.\n",
      "    *   Serpiginous (snake-like) rash tracking from the groin to the chest.\n",
      "    *   Eosinophilia (elevated eosinophil count).\n",
      "*   **Exposure:** The patient's admission of eating sushi made from fresh fish caught in the river strongly supports the diagnosis.\n",
      "*   **Differential Diagnoses:** While other conditions could present with similar symptoms, gnathostomiasis is the most likely given the combination of travel history, symptoms, and exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Risk of Untreated Gnathostomiasis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Untreated gnathostomiasis can be serious, especially if the larvae migrate to internal organs, such as the lungs, gut, genitourinary tract, eye, or central nervous system (CNS). CNS invasion can lead to severe neurological complications, including eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, subarachnoid hemorrhages, cranial neuritis, or painful radiculomyelitis. In rare cases, death can occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Therefore, the diagnosis is Gnathostomiasis, and the risk of untreated gnathostomiasis is significant, potentially leading to severe neurological complications or death.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for the 6-year-old boy from Malawi with a rapidly progressing, painless proptosis of the left eye is **Burkitt's Lymphoma**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Age:** Burkitt's lymphoma is the most common childhood cancer in areas with holoendemic malaria, and the peak age of presentation is 6 to 7 years.\n",
      "*   **Location:** The location of the mass is consistent with Burkitt's lymphoma, which often presents as a rapidly growing mass in the orbit.\n",
      "*   **Rapid Progression:** The rapid progression of the proptosis over 3 weeks is characteristic of Burkitt's lymphoma.\n",
      "*   **Painless:** The painless nature of the proptosis is more consistent with a malignancy than an infection.\n",
      "*   **Malaria Endemic Area:** The patient's residence in a malaria-endemic area is a significant risk factor for Burkitt's lymphoma.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Findings:** The absence of other systemic or neurological signs and symptoms, along with the normal appearance of the eye on examination, further supports the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investigations to Confirm Diagnosis and Direct Treatment Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The following investigations are crucial to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) or Biopsy:** This is the most important investigation to obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Histopathology will confirm the presence of Burkitt's lymphoma and allow for further classification and staging.\n",
      "2.  **Abdominal Ultrasound Scan:** To assess for intra-abdominal involvement, which is common in Burkitt's lymphoma.\n",
      "3.  **Cytospun Sample of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):** To rule out CNS involvement, which can occur in Burkitt's lymphoma.\n",
      "4.  **Full Blood Count (FBC):** To assess for anemia, thrombocytopenia, and other hematological abnormalities.\n",
      "5.  **Bone Marrow Aspirate (BMA):** To evaluate for bone marrow involvement, which is common in Burkitt's lymphoma.\n",
      "6.  **Chest Radiograph:** To rule out intrathoracic involvement.\n",
      "7.  **HIV Antibody Test:** To assess for HIV infection, which can increase the risk of Burkitt's lymphoma.\n",
      "8.  **Stool and Urine Microscopy:** To exclude or treat malaria or other parasitic infections.\n",
      "9.  **Renal Function Tests:** To assess for renal involvement.\n",
      "10. **Liver Function Tests:** To assess for liver involvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Treatment Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The treatment plan for Burkitt's lymphoma typically involves intensive chemotherapy, often with a combination of drugs such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP). The specific chemotherapy regimen will be determined by the oncologist based on the stage and extent of the disease. Supportive care, including nutritional support and management of complications, is also essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Disclaimer:** This information is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice. A definitive diagnosis and treatment plan can only be determined by a qualified healthcare professional after a thorough evaluation of the patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Histoplasmosis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a history of fever, weight loss, and disseminated cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, along with lymphadenopathy. This is a classic presentation of disseminated histoplasmosis.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** The patient is from Thailand, which is an endemic area for histoplasmosis.\n",
      "*   **Failed Antibiotic Therapy:** The patient's symptoms have not responded to various antibiotic therapies, suggesting a non-bacterial cause.\n",
      "*   **Lymph Node Biopsy:** Histopathology of a lymph node biopsy showed non-specific lymphadenitis, which can be seen in histoplasmosis.\n",
      "*   **Imaging Findings:** Radiograph of the left elbow shows osteomyelitis, which can be a complication of histoplasmosis.\n",
      "*   **Treatment Response:** The patient responded dramatically to liposomal amphotericin B, which is the standard treatment for histoplasmosis.\n",
      "*   **Negative Cultures:** The initial cultures from skin and lymph node biopsies were negative, which is not uncommon in histoplasmosis, especially in immunocompetent individuals. However, the subsequent lymph node biopsy revealed Histoplasma capsulatum by PCR, confirming the diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the combination of clinical presentation, geographic location, failed antibiotic therapy, and treatment response strongly suggests histoplasmosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is **Sickle Cell Disease with a Chronic Ankle Ulcer.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient is a 28-year-old man from Ghana with a chronic, painful ankle ulcer. He has a history of a similar ulcer on the other ankle, bone pain, jaundice, and pallor. These symptoms are highly suggestive of sickle cell disease.\n",
      "*   **Physical Examination:** The patient is short for an adult, pale, and has a tinge of jaundice. The ulcer is on his left ankle, next to the medial malleolus, with hyperpigmented skin surrounding it. Tenderness in both knee joints and in his right thigh is also consistent with sickle cell disease.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The blood film shows irreversibly sickled cells, polychromasia, target cells, and nucleated red cells. The sickle cell test is positive, and hemoglobin electrophoresis shows a homozygous HbSS-type. The wound swab grew *Pseudomonas* species sensitive to levofloxacin. Radiography shows a periosteal reaction with slightly sclerotic bones.\n",
      "*   **Differential Diagnosis:** While other conditions like tropical ulcer, diabetic ulcer, chronic osteomyelitis, Buruli ulcer, pyoderma gangrenosum, and malignant diseases could potentially cause chronic ulcers, the combination of the patient's history, physical examination findings, and laboratory results strongly points towards sickle cell disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Confirmation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To confirm the diagnosis, the following tests should be performed:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC) and Peripheral Blood Film:** To assess the presence of sickle cells, target cells, and other abnormal red blood cell morphologies.\n",
      "*   **Sickle Cell Test:** To confirm the presence of HbS.\n",
      "*   **Hemoglobin Electrophoresis:** To identify the specific type of hemoglobin present (in this case, homozygous HbSS).\n",
      "*   **Blood Culture and Wound Swab:** To rule out infection.\n",
      "*   **Radiograph of the Leg:** To assess for osteomyelitis or other bone abnormalities.\n",
      "*   **Fasting Blood Glucose:** To rule out diabetes.\n",
      "*   **Other investigations:** Liver function tests, renal function tests, and other relevant tests to assess for complications of sickle cell disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The management of sickle cell disease with a chronic ankle ulcer typically involves:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Wound Care:** Regular wound cleaning and dressing with normal saline irrigation and povidone-iodine.\n",
      "*   **Antibiotics:** Systemic antibiotics to treat infections.\n",
      "*   **Pain Management:** Analgesics such as paracetamol and tramadol for pain relief.\n",
      "*   **Folic Acid Supplementation:** To prevent megaloblastic anemia.\n",
      "*   **Hydroxyurea:** In some cases, hydroxyurea may be considered to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises.\n",
      "*   **Skin Grafting:** If the ulcer is large and not healing, skin grafting may be considered.\n",
      "*   **Nutritional Support:** Ensuring adequate nutrition to support wound healing.\n",
      "*   **Education:** Educating the patient and family about sickle cell disease and its management.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The patient's poor socioeconomic status and inability to afford a skin graft are significant challenges in managing his chronic ulcer.\n",
      "*   The high white cell counts are common in sickle cell disease and do not necessarily indicate systemic infection.\n",
      "*   The patient's bone pain should be managed conservatively with good hydration, prompt treatment of infections, and relief of other identifiable precipitants of crises.\n",
      "\n",

      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Lymphatic Filariasis (LF)**, specifically bancroftian filariasis, given the patient's history, clinical presentation, and location.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Unilateral Scrotal Swelling:** This is a common manifestation of LF, particularly hydrocoele.\n",
      "*   **Non-Tender and Non-Reducible:** This is typical of hydrocoele, which is fluid accumulation in the tunica vaginalis.\n",
      "*   **History from Myanmar:** LF is endemic in South and Southeast Asia, including Myanmar.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Fever:** While acute adenolymphangitis (ADLA) can occur in LF, the absence of fever makes it less likely.\n",
      "*   **Ultrasound Confirmation:** The ultrasound confirming hydrocoele supports the diagnosis.\n",
      "*   **Hydrocoelectomy:** The surgical drainage of 3 liters of fluid further strengthens the suspicion of hydrocoele due to LF.\n",
      "*   **Lost to Follow-up:** This is common in resource-limited settings where long-term follow-up is difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Inguinal Hernia:** While a possibility, the non-reducible nature of the swelling and the lack of palpable inguinal lymph nodes make this less likely.\n",
      "*   **Testicular Tumor:** This should be considered, but the gradual onset and lack of other testicular symptoms make it less probable.\n",
      "*   **Hydrocoele:** This is a common cause of scrotal swelling, but the patient's history and location make LF a more likely consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Investigations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Ultrasound:** Already performed and confirmed hydrocoele.\n",
      "*   **Microfilariae in Blood:** The gold standard for diagnosis, but requires collection at the correct time (night).\n",
      "*   **Circulating Filarial Antigen (CFA) Test:** A more convenient and readily available test, especially in resource-limited settings.\n",
      "*   **Lymphangiography:** Can be used to visualize lymphatic vessels and identify the source of the hydrocoele.\n",
      "*   **Consider other causes of hydrocoele:** Testicular tumor, epididymal cyst, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Treatment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Anthelmintic Drugs:** Albendazole, ivermectin, and doxycycline are used to kill the adult worms.\n",
      "*   **Hydrocoelectomy:** Surgical drainage of the hydrocoele may be necessary for large collections.\n",
      "*   **Lymphoedema Management:** Meticulous hygiene, wound care, and specialized shoes are crucial for managing lymphoedema.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the clinical presentation, history, and investigations, the most likely diagnosis is Lymphatic Filariasis (bancroftian filariasis) with hydrocoele. Further investigations, such as microfilariae in blood and CFA tests, are recommended to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment with anthelmintic drugs and management of lymphoedema are essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **pellagra**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a classic triad of symptoms:\n",
      "    *   **Dermatitis:** The hyperpigmented, dry, and photosensitive rash, particularly around the neck and sun-exposed areas, is highly suggestive of pellagra. The description of the rash as \"dry, tender to touch\" and painful upon sun exposure further supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "    *   **Diarrhea:** Watery diarrhea is a common symptom of pellagra.\n",
      "    *   **Dementia:** The patient's confusion and restlessness are consistent with the neuropsychiatric manifestations of pellagra.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location and Season:** The patient is from Malawi, a region where pellagra is endemic, especially during the rainy season when food supplies are limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Dietary History:** The patient's diet, consisting mainly of maize porridge with a few vegetables, is likely deficient in tryptophan, the precursor to niacin (vitamin B3). Maize is a poor source of tryptophan, and the removal of the husks during processing further reduces its nutritional value.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Differential Diagnoses:** While pellagra is the most likely diagnosis, other conditions should be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **HIV Infection:** HIV can cause diarrhea, skin rashes, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, the patient's HIV status is unknown, and the classic pellagra triad is more prominent.\n",
      "    *   **Tuberculosis (TB):** TB meningitis can cause confusion and neurological symptoms. However, the rash is less typical of TB meningitis.\n",
      "    *   **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):** SLE can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin rashes, diarrhea, and neurological problems. However, the rash in SLE is often different from the pellagra rash.\n",
      "    *   **Iron Deficiency Anemia:** This can cause fatigue, weakness, and sometimes neurological symptoms. However, the rash and diarrhea are less typical.\n",
      "    *   **Other nutritional deficiencies:** Deficiencies in other vitamins and minerals can also cause similar symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The management of pellagra involves:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Diagnosis Confirmation:** While the clinical presentation is highly suggestive, a confirmatory test (e.g., niacin excretion test) may be considered.\n",
      "2.  **Niacin Supplementation:** Niacin (vitamin B3) is the primary treatment for pellagra. The recommended dose is 50-400 mg daily in the acute phase, followed by 50-150 mg daily for 2 weeks.\n",
      "3.  **Dietary Counseling:** Educate the patient and her family about the importance of a balanced diet rich in tryptophan-containing foods (e.g., peanuts, fish, meat, eggs, milk). Advise them to eat maize directly from the cob to retain the nutritious husks.\n",
      "4.  **Supportive Care:** Provide soothing applications for the skin lesions and advise the patient to avoid sun exposure until the rash resolves.\n",
      "5.  **Address other deficiencies:** Supplement with other B vitamins, zinc, magnesium and a diet rich in calories.\n",
      "6.  **Anthelmintic treatment:** Treat intestinal helminth infection.\n",
      "\n",

      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Falciparum Malaria, likely with a potential for secondary bacterial infection or other complications.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Initial Presentation:** The patient presents with fever, chills, headache, and dry cough, all consistent with malaria.\n",
      "*   **Positive Rapid Diagnostic Test (HRP-2):** A positive HRP-2 test indicates the presence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.\n",
      "*   **History of Artemether Treatment:** The patient received artemether, an antimalarial drug, but did not improve. This is a crucial piece of information.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Improvement with Artemether:** The lack of response to artemether, despite a history of malaria, raises suspicion for several possibilities.\n",
      "*   **Possible Causes of Lack of Response:**\n",
      "    *   **Artemisinin Resistance:** Southern Laos has been reported to have artemisinin-resistant malaria.\n",
      "    *   **Incorrect Dosage or Duration:** The patient may have received an inadequate dose or duration of artemether.\n",
      "    *   **Substandard Artemether:** The artemether may have been substandard, containing less active ingredient than stated.\n",
      "    *   **Secondary Bacterial Infection:** The patient's symptoms (abdominal tenderness, chest pain) could be due to a secondary bacterial infection.\n",
      "    *   **Other Infections:** The patient could have another infectious disease contracted in Laos.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Bacterial Coinfection:** Given the abdominal and chest pain, a bacterial infection is a significant concern.\n",
      "*   **Other Infectious Diseases:** Scrub typhus, murine typhus, leptospirosis, tuberculosis, and dengue fever are all possibilities in the region.\n",
      "*   **Drug-Induced Liver Injury:** Although less likely given the history, it should be considered.\n",
      "*   **Other Malarial Complications:** Cerebral malaria, severe anemia, or other complications of malaria.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Approach:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Repeat History:** Confirm the details of the treatment, including the dosage, duration, and source of the artemether.\n",
      "2.  **Physical Examination:** Thoroughly examine the patient for signs of secondary infection (e.g., abdominal tenderness, chest pain, skin lesions).\n",
      "3.  **Investigations:**\n",
      "    *   **Blood Cultures:** To rule out bacterial infection.\n",
      "    *   **Chest Radiograph:** To evaluate for pneumonia or other lung pathology.\n",
      "    *   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To assess for anemia or other hematological abnormalities.\n",
      "    *   **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):** To rule out drug-induced liver injury.\n",
      "    *   **Malaria Smear:** Although the rapid diagnostic test was positive, a repeat smear may be helpful to confirm the presence of parasites and assess the parasite density.\n",
      "    *   **Artemisinin Resistance Testing:** If available, testing for artemisinin resistance could help determine if the patient has a resistant strain of malaria.\n",
      "    *   **Other Tests:** Depending on the clinical findings, other tests may be necessary to rule out other infections (e.g., leptospirosis serology, scrub typhus serology, dengue serology).\n",
      "4.  **Treatment:**\n",
      "    *   **If Bacterial Infection is Confirmed:** Initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.\n",
      "    *   **If Artemisinin Resistance is Confirmed:** Consider alternative antimalarial treatment options.\n",
      "    *   **If Substandard Artemether is Suspected:** Retreat with a known, quality-assured antimalarial drug (e.g., oral artemether-lumefantrine).\n",
      "    *   **If No Obvious Cause is Found:** Continue treatment with quinine and doxycycline, monitoring the patient's response closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Quality of Medicines:** The case highlights the importance of ensuring the quality of antimalarial drugs.\n",
      "*   **National Treatment Guidelines:** Adherence to national treatment guidelines is crucial for effective malaria management.\n",
      "*   **Patient Education:** Educate patients about the importance of taking medications as prescribed and reporting any adverse effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the patient's presentation is highly suggestive of falciparum malaria, but the lack of response to artemether warrants further investigation to rule out secondary infections, drug resistance, or substandard medication.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for the 4-year-old girl from Uganda is **Retinopathy-Positive Cerebral Malaria**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The child presents with a coma, a positive malaria RDT, hepatosplenomegaly, and a gallop rhythm on cardiac examination. These findings are highly suggestive of cerebral malaria.\n",
      "*   **Ophthalmoscopic Findings:** The key finding is the presence of white-centred hemorrhages in both eyes, which are characteristic of malarial retinopathy.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Results:** The laboratory results show anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are common in malaria.\n",
      "*   **Differential Diagnosis:** While other conditions like bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, and intoxication are possible causes of coma, the combination of malaria RDT positivity, ophthalmological findings, and the child's location in a malaria-endemic area makes cerebral malaria the most probable diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis is retinopathy-positive cerebral malaria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the clinical presentation and the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Tetanus**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **History:** The patient is a 62-year-old woman from rural Ethiopia, which is a high-risk area for tetanus due to limited access to vaccination and potential exposure to contaminated wounds.\n",
      "*   **Symptoms:** Difficulty chewing (trismus) is a classic early symptom of tetanus. The progression to generalized spasms and dysphagia further supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Findings:** The unremarkable physical examination is consistent with early tetanus, where the initial symptoms may be subtle.\n",
      "*   **Management:** The patient received metronidazole (an antibiotic) and antitoxin, which are standard treatments for tetanus. The subsequent spasms and the need for intrathecal antitoxin and a prophylactic tracheotomy are also indicative of severe tetanus.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While tetanus is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities should be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA):** This is a less likely diagnosis given the patient's age and the lack of other typical GCA symptoms (e.g., headache, jaw claudication). However, an ESR should be performed to rule it out.\n",
      "*   **Other causes of trismus:** These include dental problems, temporomandibular joint disorders, and other muscle disorders. However, these are less likely given the patient's history and the progression of symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Immediate Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The immediate management of tetanus involves:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Antibiotics:** Metronidazole is the preferred antibiotic.\n",
      "*   **Antitoxin:** This is crucial to neutralize circulating tetanospasmin.\n",
      "*   **Supportive Care:** This includes a dark, quiet environment, diazepam for spasms, and monitoring for complications such as laryngeal spasm and respiratory failure.\n",
      "*   **Tracheotomy:** A prophylactic tracheotomy may be necessary to prevent laryngeal spasm and respiratory arrest.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the clinical picture strongly suggests tetanus, and prompt treatment with antibiotics, antitoxin, and supportive care is essential.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Buruli Ulcer (BU)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Bacterial Infections:** Cellulitis, erysipelas, necrotizing fasciitis (less likely given the chronic, slow progression and lack of systemic symptoms).\n",
      "*   **Fungal Infections:** Fungal infections can cause skin ulcers, but the described presentation with induration, hypo/hyperpigmentation, and satellite lesions is more characteristic of BU.\n",
      "*   **Viral Infections:** Herpes zoster (shingles) can cause painful skin lesions, but the lack of pain and the presence of induration make this less likely.\n",
      "*   **Parasitic Infections:** Cutaneous leishmaniasis can cause skin ulcers, but the described presentation is less typical.\n",
      "*   **Trauma:** While trauma could cause a skin ulcer, the presence of induration and satellite lesions is not typical of trauma alone.\n",
      "*   **Autoimmune Diseases:** Some autoimmune diseases can cause skin lesions, but the described presentation is not typical.\n",
      "*   **Hematological Disorders:** Certain hematological disorders can cause skin lesions, but the described presentation is not typical.\n",
      "*   **Neoplastic Diseases:** Skin cancer can cause skin ulcers, but the described presentation is not typical.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Appropriate Clinical Approach:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Immediate Wound Care:**\n",
      "    *   Provide pain relief.\n",
      "    *   Maintain a sterile, moist environment for the wound.\n",
      "    *   Use saline-soaked gauze and change it daily.\n",
      "    *   Consider povidone-iodine to control bacterial colonization.\n",
      "    *   Ensure tetanus prophylaxis.\n",
      "    *   Document wound progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Laboratory Confirmation:**\n",
      "    *   PCR from a wound swab to confirm the presence of *Mycobacterium ulcerans*.\n",
      "    *   Recognize that laboratory confirmation may be limited by availability and cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Treatment:**\n",
      "    *   Initiate specific antimycobacterial therapy (rifampicin, streptomycin, or clarithromycin) as soon as possible.\n",
      "    *   Consider delaying treatment for a few days if the patient has no systemic symptoms to minimize antibiotic toxicity.\n",
      "    *   Be prepared for potential paradoxical reactions (new lesions) during or after treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Surgical Debridement:**\n",
      "    *   Consider surgical debridement if the clinical picture warrants it, based on the availability of adequate anesthesia and surgical care.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Supportive Care:**\n",
      "    *   Provide adequate nutrition.\n",
      "    *   Address any secondary bacterial infections.\n",
      "    *   Correct any restricted movements with physiotherapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Expert Consultation:**\n",
      "    *   Consult with a specialist in tropical and infectious diseases for guidance on complex cases, especially if there is uncertainty about the diagnosis or treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The geographical location (West Africa) is highly suggestive of BU.\n",
      "*   The patient's age and the location of the lesions on the extremities are also consistent with BU.\n",
      "*   The absence of major trauma or systemic symptoms is also consistent with BU.\n",
      "*   The presence of induration, hypo/hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and satellite lesions is characteristic of BU.\n",
      "*   The slow progression of the lesions is also consistent with BU.\n",
      "*   The patient's anxiety should be addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case highlights the importance of considering BU in children presenting with skin ulcers in endemic areas. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications and improve outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Cutaneous Larva Migrans (CLM)**, also known as creeping eruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The description of the reddish, serpiginous tracks that move forward in an irregular pattern is highly characteristic of CLM. The intense itching is also a key symptom.\n",
      "*   **Travel History:** The patient's recent travel to northern Australia, particularly to a beach area, is a significant risk factor for CLM. Hookworm larvae are commonly found in sand and soil in warm, humid climates.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Other Findings:** The absence of fever, cough, or wheeze makes other infectious diseases less likely. The lack of enlarged lymph nodes also makes other conditions less likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While CLM is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities to consider include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Strongyloidiasis (Larva Currens):** This is a less likely diagnosis because the larvae move much faster than in CLM.\n",
      "*   **Other Nematode Infections:** Gnathostoma or Fasciola infections are less common causes of creeping eruptions.\n",
      "*   **Migratory Myiasis:** This is caused by fly larvae that burrow into the skin, but the description doesn't fit the typical appearance of myiasis.\n",
      "*   **Other Skin Conditions:** While less likely given the history, other skin conditions could present with similar lesions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The recommended management for CLM is:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Ivermectin:** A single dose of ivermectin (200 μg/kg) is the treatment of choice.\n",
      "*   **Albendazole:** An alternative is albendazole (400 mg twice daily for 3 days).\n",
      "*   **Topical Thiabendazole:** Topical thiabendazole can be used, but it requires more compliance and may be difficult in multiple lesions.\n",
      "*   **Hygiene:** Good hygiene is important to prevent secondary bacterial infections.\n",
      "*   **Prevention:** Educate the patient about the risk of CLM in tropical areas and advise them to wear appropriate footwear when walking on sand or soil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis is **Cutaneous Larva Migrans (CLM)**, and the recommended management is a single dose of ivermectin or albendazole, along with good hygiene and preventative measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a painful, growing lesion on the conjunctiva of her left eye that has progressed to blindness. This is a classic presentation of OSSN.\n",
      "*   **Risk Factors:** The patient is HIV-positive, which is a significant risk factor for OSSN, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "*   **Location:** OSSN is commonly found on the conjunctiva, which aligns with the patient's presentation.\n",
      "*   **Progression:** The lesion's progression from a whitish lesion to a reddish, growing tumor and eventual blindness is consistent with the natural history of OSSN.\n",
      "*   **Other Considerations:** While other possibilities exist (e.g., other types of tumors, inflammatory conditions), the combination of HIV status, location, and progression makes OSSN the most probable diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The management plan should include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Pain Control:** Analgesics (NSAIDs) to manage the pain.\n",
      "2.  **Surgical Excision:** The definitive treatment for OSSN is surgical excision. The patient should be counselled about the need for surgery.\n",
      "3.  **HIV Management:** Control of the patient's HIV infection is crucial. This includes:\n",
      "    *   Checking the CD4 count (if not already known).\n",
      "    *   Ensuring the patient is on effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) to achieve viral load control.\n",
      "    *   Considering a switch to a more effective ART regimen if the current regimen is not adequately controlling the viral load.\n",
      "4.  **Right Eye Examination:** A thorough examination of the right eye is necessary to rule out the development of OSSN in the unaffected eye.\n",
      "5.  **Fundoscopy:** A fundoscopy should be performed to rule out other causes of vision loss, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis.\n",
      "6.  **Counseling:** The patient should be counselled about the diagnosis, the need for surgery, and the importance of ART adherence.\n",
      "7.  **Discharge Plan:** The patient should be discharged with instructions to return to the hospital if she experiences any worsening of her symptoms or develops new symptoms. She should also be instructed to report to her ART clinic for follow-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Delay in Diagnosis:** The patient's delay in seeking treatment is common in resource-limited settings.\n",
      "*   **Patient Refusal of Surgery:** The patient's refusal of surgery is understandable, given her concerns and the potential for disfigurement. However, it is important to continue to counsel her about the benefits of surgery and the risks of delaying treatment.\n",
      "*   **Follow-up:** Close follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence and to ensure that the patient is adhering to her ART regimen.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the most likely diagnosis is OSSN, and the management should focus on pain control, surgical excision, HIV management, and close follow-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for this 7-year-old girl from South Sudan is **Visceral Leishmaniasis (Kala-Azar)**.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a 4-week history of undulating fever, anorexia, general body pains, dry cough, and progressive weight loss. These are classic symptoms of VL.\n",
      "*   **Physical Findings:** Splenomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy are highly suggestive of VL.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Results:** Pancytopenia (low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets) is a common finding in VL due to the parasite's effect on the reticuloendothelial system.\n",
      "*   **Negative Malaria Test:** The negative malaria RDT and blood film rule out malaria as the primary cause of the fever.\n",
      "*   **Negative Brucellosis and Leishmaniasis Serology:** While these are important to rule out, the negative serology does not exclude VL, especially in resource-limited settings where testing may be less sensitive.\n",
      "*   **Family History:** The uncle's history of VL treatment and the sister's TB treatment increase the likelihood of VL, as these conditions can weaken the immune system and increase susceptibility to infection.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** South Sudan is an endemic area for VL.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Approach:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Admission:** The patient's critical condition (severe malnutrition, progressive anaemia, and deteriorating health) necessitates immediate admission to a hospital with appropriate resources.\n",
      "2.  **Further Investigations:**\n",
      "    *   **Repeat Serological Tests:** Perform a second serological test, such as the Direct Agglutination Test (DAT), to confirm the diagnosis of VL.\n",
      "    *   **Tissue Biopsy:** Attempt to obtain a splenic aspirate for microscopic examination to confirm the presence of Leishmania amastigotes. This is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it carries risks, especially in resource-limited settings.\n",
      "    *   **Blood Cultures:** Obtain blood cultures to rule out bacterial infections, which can complicate VL.\n",
      "3.  **Treatment:**\n",
      "    *   **Liposomal Amphotericin B:** Start the patient on liposomal amphotericin B, the first-line treatment for VL.\n",
      "    *   **Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics:** Administer a broad-spectrum antibiotic (e.g., ceftriaxone) to prevent or treat bacterial superinfections.\n",
      "    *   **Nutritional Support:** Provide high-energy/high-protein ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and vitamin/mineral supplementation to address the severe malnutrition.\n",
      "4.  **Monitoring:** Closely monitor the patient's response to treatment, including fever reduction, weight gain, and improvement in hematological parameters.\n",
      "5.  **Public Health Measures:** Implement public health measures to control the spread of VL, such as vector control (sandfly control) and case detection and treatment.\n",
      "\n",

      "*   **Tuberculosis:** Can cause fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. However, the negative TB serology and the presence of splenomegaly make this less likely.\n",
      "*   **Malaria:** Although malaria was ruled out by the negative RDT and blood film, it is important to consider it as a possibility, especially in endemic areas.\n",
      "*   **HIV Infection:** Can cause fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. However, the negative HIV serology makes this less likely.\n",
      "*   **Other Infections:** Consider other infections that can cause fever, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy, such as typhoid fever, leptospirosis, and fungal infections.\n",
      "*   **Malignancies:** Consider malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma, which can present with fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Resource Constraints:** In resource-limited settings, diagnostic testing may be limited. A pragmatic clinical approach is necessary, based on the patient's history, physical examination, and available laboratory tests.\n",

      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The symptoms of dyspnoea, cyanosis, irritability, grunting, hepatomegaly, and oedematous extremities are all consistent with the \"wet\" form of beriberi, which is characterized by heart failure.\n",
      "*   **History:** The history of exclusive breastfeeding and maternal food avoidance is a significant risk factor for thiamine deficiency in infants. The mother's symptoms (anorexia, weakness, husky voice, paresthesias) further support this diagnosis.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** Laos is an endemic area for infantile beriberi.\n",
      "*   **Rapid Response to Thiamine:** The child's rapid improvement after intravenous thiamine administration is a strong indicator of thiamine deficiency.\n",
      "*   **Confirmation:** The laboratory confirmation of thiamine deficiency in both the child and the mother strengthens the diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Immediate Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Intravenous Thiamine:** Administer intravenous thiamine (50 mg) immediately to rapidly increase tissue thiamine levels.\n",
      "2.  **Monitoring:** Closely monitor the child's response to thiamine, including respiratory status, heart rate, and overall clinical condition.\n",
      "3.  **Thiamine Supplementation for Mother:** Provide oral thiamine supplementation to the mother to address her own thiamine deficiency.\n",
      "4.  **Dietary Education:** Educate the mother about thiamine-rich foods (e.g., pulses, groundnuts, whole wheat, fruits and vegetables) and the dangers of food avoidance.\n",

      "*   **Dietary History:** Obtain a more detailed dietary history from the mother to assess the extent of food avoidance and thiamine intake.\n",
      "*   **Other Symptoms:** Inquire about any other symptoms the child or mother may be experiencing, such as neurological symptoms (e.g., seizures, lethargy) or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While infantile beriberi is the most likely diagnosis, it's important to consider other possibilities, although less likely given the clinical picture:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Congenital Heart Disease:** Although the absence of a heart murmur makes this less likely, it should still be considered, especially if the child's symptoms are not fully explained by thiamine deficiency.\n",
      "*   **Respiratory Infections:** While less likely given the absence of cough and fever, respiratory infections can cause dyspnoea and cyanosis.\n",
      "*   **Meningitis:** The absence of fever and bulging fontanels makes this less likely.\n",
      "*   **Other Metabolic Disorders:** Other metabolic disorders can cause similar symptoms, but these are less likely given the history of food avoidance.\n",

      "Based on the provided clinical presentation, history, examination findings, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is an **amoebic liver abscess**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with fever, right hypochondrial pain, and a dry cough. These are classic symptoms of an amoebic liver abscess. The right-sided pain is particularly suggestive.\n",
      "*   **History:** The patient's history of consuming locally brewed alcohol ('toddy') is a significant risk factor for amoebiasis. The contamination of toddy with *Entamoeba histolytica* is a well-known cause of liver abscesses in endemic areas.\n",
      "*   **Examination Findings:** The tender hepatomegaly, intercostal tenderness, and elevated right hemidiaphragm on chest radiograph further support the diagnosis of a liver abscess. The absence of jaundice is also consistent with amoebic liver abscess, as it is less common than in other types of liver abscesses.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Results:** The mildly elevated transaminases (AST and ALT), elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and raised inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein) are non-specific but can be seen in liver inflammation and infection. The AST being higher than ALT is also consistent with alcoholic liver disease, but the clinical picture is more suggestive of an abscess.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Diagnosis Confirmation:**\n",
      "    *   **Ultrasound:** An abdominal ultrasound is crucial to confirm the presence of a liver lesion and assess its size and characteristics.\n",
      "    *   **Serology:** Serological tests for *Entamoeba histolytica* (e.g., ELISA) can be helpful, but they may have limited sensitivity in endemic areas.\n",
      "    *   **Aspiration and Culture:** Aspiration of the suspected abscess under ultrasound guidance is the gold standard for diagnosis. The aspirated fluid should be sent for Gram stain, culture, and microscopy to confirm the presence of *Entamoeba histolytica* trophozoites. Multiplex PCR testing on aspirated fluid is a rapid and robust diagnosis of amoebic liver abscess in patients with cystic focal liver lesions.\n",
      "2.  **Treatment:**\n",
      "    *   **Metronidazole:** Metronidazole is the first-line treatment for amoebic liver abscesses. It should be administered intravenously or orally for 7-10 days.\n",
      "    *   **Luminal Amoebicide:** A luminal amoebicide (e.g., paromomycin, diloxanide furoate, or iodoquinol) should be given concurrently with metronidazole to eradicate the parasite in the intestinal tract.\n",
      "    *   **Follow-up:** Close follow-up is essential to monitor the patient's response to treatment and to rule out complications such as rupture of the abscess.\n",
      "    *   **Consider drainage:** Therapeutic percutaneous aspiration or drainage may be considered in large abscesses, especially those located in the left liver lobe with high risk for rupturing into the pericardium, and in ALA that do not respond to nitroimidazole therapy within 72 hours when pyogenic infection is a concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Differential Diagnosis:** While amoebic liver abscess is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities should be considered, including pyogenic liver abscess, fungal liver abscess, and other infectious causes.\n",
      "*   **Complications:** Be aware of potential complications such as rupture of the abscess, secondary bacterial infection, and spread to other organs.\n",
      "*   **Patient Education:** Educate the patient about the importance of hygiene, sanitation, and safe food and water practices to prevent future infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis is most likely an amoebic liver abscess, and the management should focus on confirming the diagnosis with aspiration and culture, initiating treatment with metronidazole and a luminal amoebicide, and providing close follow-up.\n",

      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis** on top of tuberculous lymphadenitis, possibly iatrogenic due to the initial FNA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Initial Presentation:** The patient presented with a painful, swollen neck, fever, night sweats, and weight loss, all suggestive of TB lymphadenitis. The positive AFB in the FNA further supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Response to TB Treatment:** The patient's failure to improve on TB treatment despite being on ART and co-trimoxazole is a key indicator that something else is going on.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Deterioration:** The increasing fluctuance of the lymph nodes, along with the purulent material on FNA, strongly suggests a bacterial infection.\n",
      "*   **Microscopic Findings:** The presence of coccoid bacteria and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes on FNA is consistent with a bacterial infection.\n",
      "*   **HIV Status:** The patient's HIV status and low CD4 count (109 cells/μL) make him highly susceptible to opportunistic infections, including bacterial infections.\n",
      "*   **Other Considerations:** While IRIS is a possibility, the patient's lack of improvement on TB treatment and the presence of frank pus on FNA make a bacterial infection more likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is to treat the superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis with appropriate antibiotics, while continuing the patient on TB treatment and ART.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Further Investigations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **HIV Viral Load and CD4 Count:** To assess the response to ART and monitor for IRIS.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a painless papulovesicular lesion on the neck that has evolved into an ulcerated lesion with surrounding edema. This is a classic presentation of cutaneous anthrax.\n",
      "*   **History:** The patient reports a break in the skin at the lesion site, which is a common risk factor for anthrax.\n",
      "*   **Systemic Symptoms:** The patient experiences fatigue, diaphoresis, mild confusion, and headache, which can be associated with systemic anthrax.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The initial blood cultures were negative, but subsequent cultures and biopsy results confirmed the presence of *Bacillus anthracis*.\n",
      "*   **Exposure:** The patient's occupation as a postal worker raises the possibility of exposure to contaminated mail, which can be a source of anthrax spores.\n",
      "*   **Differential Diagnosis:** While other conditions like bacterial ecthyma, rickettsial diseases, and necrotic arachnidism can present with similar skin lesions, the combination of the clinical presentation, history, and laboratory findings strongly suggests anthrax.\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **severe malaria, specifically Plasmodium falciparum malaria, complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Travel History:** The patient's travel to rural Nigeria, a region with a high prevalence of malaria, is a significant risk factor.\n",
      "*   **Symptoms:** Fever, jaundice, confusion, and a low-grade fever at presentation are all consistent with malaria.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The presence of *Plasmodium falciparum* parasites in the blood confirms malaria. The elevated creatinine (430 μmol/L) indicates acute kidney injury, a known complication of severe malaria. The patient's deteriorating consciousness and the development of ARDS suggest severe malaria with complications.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Course:** The patient's initial improvement after artesunate treatment followed by a relapse and the development of ARDS are typical of severe malaria complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While malaria is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities to consider include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF):** Although the incubation period is longer than 18 days, VHF should be considered, especially given the patient's travel history. However, the absence of rash and injected sclerae makes this less likely.\n",
      "*   **Acute Viral Hepatitis:** This is less likely given the presence of malaria parasites in the blood.\n",
      "*   **Typhoid Fever:** This is a possibility, but the presence of malaria parasites makes it less likely.\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Patient Profile:** The patient is HIV-positive, which is a significant risk factor for PCP.\n",
      "*   **Symptoms:** The patient presents with a classic PCP presentation: progressive shortness of breath, dry cough, and drenching night sweats.\n",
      "*   **Physical Findings:** The patient is febrile and has hypoxemia (low oxygen saturation). The chest auscultation is clear, which is common in PCP.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The patient's CD4 count is low (150/μL), further supporting the diagnosis of PCP. The elevated CRP is also consistent with an inflammatory process.\n",
      "*   **Chest Radiography:** The chest radiograph shows bilateral perihilar infiltrates, which is a hallmark of PCP.\n",
      "*   **Travel History:** The patient's extensive travel history increases the risk of exposure to opportunistic infections like PCP.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Further Investigations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "To confirm the diagnosis, the following investigations are crucial:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Bronchoscopy with Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):** This is the gold standard for diagnosing PCP. The BAL fluid should be examined for the presence of *Pneumocystis jirovecii* cysts or trophozoites using methods like Grocott methenamine silver staining or PCR.\n",
      "2.  **Induced Sputum:** A less sensitive alternative to BAL, but can be used if bronchoscopy is not feasible.\n",
      "3.  **Serum 1,3 β-D-glucan:** This test is sensitive for PCP but not specific. A positive result should be followed by a definitive diagnosis with BAL or induced sputum.\n",
      "4.  **CD4 Count:** To assess the patient's immune status and guide treatment decisions.\n",
      "5.  **Chest CT Scan:** While not diagnostic, a CT scan can help rule out other conditions and assess the extent of the lung involvement.\n",
      "6.  **Sputum for Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB):** To rule out tuberculosis, which can present with similar symptoms.\n",
      "7.  **Blood Cultures:** To rule out bacterial infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Immediate Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Oxygen Therapy:** To correct hypoxemia and maintain oxygen saturation above 95%.\n",
      "2.  **High-Dose Co-trimoxazole:** This is the first-line treatment for PCP. It should be started as soon as possible.\n",
      "3.  **Corticosteroids:** In moderate to severe PCP, corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone or methylprednisolone) should be added to the treatment regimen.\n",
      "4.  **Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI):** To prevent gastrointestinal side effects of co-trimoxazole.\n",
      "5.  **Monitoring:** Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, oxygen saturation, and response to treatment is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While PCP is the most likely diagnosis, other conditions should be considered:\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Konzo**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with acute-onset, non-progressive spastic paraparesis, which is a hallmark of Konzo. The absence of sensory or bladder/bowel symptoms is also consistent with Konzo.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** The patient is from rural Tanzania, a region where Konzo is endemic.\n",
      "*   **Dietary History:** The patient's diet for the past two months has been almost exclusively cassava, which is a key risk factor for Konzo.\n",
      "*   **Epidemiological Context:** The fact that the patient's illness occurred around the same time as similar cases in his village strongly suggests an epidemic, which is common in Konzo outbreaks.\n",
      "*   **Investigations:** The investigations are normal, which helps to rule out other causes of spastic paraparesis such as spinal tuberculosis, spinal cord infections, spinal malignancy, and tropical nutritional myeloneuropathies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the clinical picture strongly points towards Konzo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the clinical presentation, history, and investigations, the most likely diagnosis is **Chromoblastomycosis**.\n",

      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **History:** The patient's history of a minor trauma (leech bite) followed by the development of verrucous, slowly spreading lesions over years is highly suggestive of chromoblastomycosis.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Findings:** The description of the lesions (cauliflower-like masses, oval plaque-like lesions, partly erythematous, partly fungating and purulent, oozing a bad odour) is consistent with chromoblastomycosis. The centripetal spread of the lesions is also characteristic.\n",
      "*   **Radiology:** The absence of bone involvement on radiography is typical for chromoblastomycosis.\n",
      "*   **Microscopy:** The identification of \"Medlar bodies\" (sclerotic cells) in skin scrapings is pathognomonic for chromoblastomycosis.\n",
      "*   **PCR:** The positive PCR result confirming the presence of *Fonsecaea* species (e.g., *F. pedrosoi*, *F. monophora*, *F. nubica*) further supports the diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Sporotrichosis:** While sporotrichosis can present with verrucous lesions, it typically has a more nodular and linear spread. The presence of sclerotic cells is not characteristic of sporotrichosis.\n",
      "*   **Mycetoma:** Although mycetoma can present with verrucous lesions, it is usually associated with granules in the lesions, which are not mentioned in the description.\n",
      "*   **Mycobacterial infections:** Cutaneous tuberculosis and lepromatous leprosy can present with verrucous lesions, but the presence of sclerotic cells is not typical.\n",
      "*   **Cutaneous leishmaniasis:** Cutaneous leishmaniasis can present with verrucous lesions, but the presence of sclerotic cells is not typical.\n",
      "*   **Kaposi's Sarcoma:** Kaposi's sarcoma can present with verrucous lesions, but it is more common in immunocompromised individuals.\n",
      "*   **Squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoidosis, chronic eczema, and psoriasis:** These conditions can present with skin lesions, but the verrucous, slowly spreading nature of the lesions in this case is less typical.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Diagnostic Tests:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Direct Microscopy:** Skin scrapings should be examined under a microscope to look for sclerotic cells (Medlar bodies).\n",

      "*   **Antifungal therapy:** Oral itraconazole is the most commonly used antifungal agent for chromoblastomycosis.\n",
      "*   **Surgical debridement:** Surgical debridement of the lesions can help remove infected tissue.\n",
      "*   **Topical therapy:** Topical antifungal agents can be used to treat localized lesions.\n",

      "*   **Snake Identification:** The description of the snake (brown with V-shaped black bands, approximately 1 meter long) strongly suggests an African Puff-Adder (Bitis arietans). This is a highly venomous snake known for its aggressive behavior and potent venom.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient's symptoms are consistent with a severe envenomation:\n",
      "    *   **Necrotic Wound:** Extensive necrosis of the foot is a hallmark of puff-adder bites.\n",
      "    *   **Swelling and Pain:** Significant swelling and pain are common local effects of the venom.\n",
      "    *   **Bleeding:** Gum bleeding and vomiting suggest systemic effects of the venom.\n",
      "    *   **Lymph Node Enlargement:** Enlarged lymph nodes indicate the body's immune response to the venom.\n",
      "    *   **Septic Shock:** The patient's presentation of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress points towards sepsis, likely secondary to the envenomation.\n",
      "*   **Timeframe:** The fact that the bite occurred 3 weeks prior is relevant. While antivenom is most effective when administered soon after the bite, it can still be beneficial in severe cases, especially if the patient develops systemic complications.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Antivenom Use:** The decision not to use antivenom after 3 weeks is understandable, given the delay. However, the severity of the patient's condition (sepsis, necrosis) might warrant its consideration, especially if the patient's condition deteriorates.\n",

      "2.  **Pain Relief:** Administer analgesics (e.g., paracetamol) for pain management. Avoid aspirin, as it can worsen bleeding.\n",
      "3.  **Immobilization:** Immobilize the affected limb to reduce venom absorption.\n",
      "4.  **Pressure Immobilization:** If neurotoxic venom is suspected, use a pressure immobilization technique (e.g., elastic bandage) to reduce venom spread.\n",
      "5.  **Wound Care:** Leave the wound open to prevent infection.\n",
      "6.  **Rapid Transport:** Transport the patient to a healthcare facility as quickly as possible.\n",

      "    *   Eosinophilia: A hallmark of parasitic infections, including Loiasis.\n",
      "    *   Transient subcutaneous swellings: These are characteristic of Loiasis, often described as \"Calabar swellings.\"\n",
      "    *   Palpitations: Can be associated with Loiasis, especially if the adult worms migrate through the heart.\n",
      "    *   Pericarditis: Although less common, Loiasis can cause cardiac complications.\n",
      "*   **Diagnostic Findings:**\n",
      "    *   Positive serology for filarial infections.\n",
      "    *   Microfilariae identified in blood samples with a tapered tail, characteristic of *Loa loa*.\n",
      "    *   Decreasing microfilarial count and eosinophil count after treatment.\n",
      "*   **Treatment Response:** The patient responded well to albendazole and ivermectin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The presence of sheathed microfilariae with a tapered tail, along with the patient's history and symptoms, strongly points to Loiasis. The diurnal periodicity of microfilariae in *Loa loa* is also consistent with the patient's symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the diagnosis is **Loiasis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the suspected diagnosis is **Invasive Non-Typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infection** in a 35-year-old Malawian woman with fever, severe anemia, and HIV-positive status.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with fever, weakness, weight loss, and severe anemia. These are common symptoms of iNTS infection, especially in individuals with advanced HIV.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The negative malaria rapid diagnostic test and positive HIV serology further support the possibility of iNTS infection, as it is a common cause of sepsis in HIV-positive individuals in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "*   **Physical Examination:** The presence of splenomegaly is also consistent with iNTS infection.\n",
      "*   **Differential Diagnosis:** While other conditions like tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and other infections could be considered, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings makes iNTS the most likely diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient requires immediate and comprehensive management, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Fluid Resuscitation:** Due to the patient's low blood pressure and signs of dehydration, intravenous fluids are essential to stabilize her condition.\n",
      "2.  **Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics:** Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated immediately, covering common causes of sepsis in HIV-positive individuals. Ceftriaxone is a good choice.\n",
      "3.  **Blood Cultures:** Blood cultures should be obtained before starting antibiotics to identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic selection.\n",
      "4.  **TB Screening:** Given the high prevalence of TB in HIV-positive individuals, a chest radiograph and other TB screening tests (e.g., LAM urine test) are crucial.\n",
      "5.  **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):** Starting ART as soon as possible is essential to improve the patient's immune function and prevent opportunistic infections.\n",
      "6.  **Co-trimoxazole Prophylaxis:** To prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and other opportunistic infections, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis should be initiated.\n",
      "7.  **Nutritional Support:** The patient's wasting and anemia require nutritional support, including therapeutic feeding.\n",
      "8.  **Monitoring:** Close monitoring of the patient's clinical status, laboratory values, and response to treatment is essential.\n",
      "9.  **Further Investigations:** Depending on the patient's response to treatment, further investigations may be needed to rule out other conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case highlights the importance of considering iNTS infection in HIV-positive individuals presenting with fever and sepsis, especially in resource-limited settings. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to improve outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Tuberculous Meningitis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with headache, confusion, fever, and a unilateral third nerve palsy (ptosis). This combination is highly suggestive of meningitis.\n",
      "*   **CSF Findings:** The CSF analysis reveals a high white blood cell count, low glucose, and elevated protein, all consistent with an inflammatory process within the central nervous system.\n",
      "*   **Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) in CSF:** The detection of AFB in the CSF is a strong indicator of mycobacterial infection, specifically *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.\n",
      "*   **HIV Status:** The patient's HIV-positive status increases the likelihood of tuberculous meningitis, as HIV infection is a significant risk factor.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Course:** The patient's deterioration into a coma and the development of basal ganglia infarctions are complications associated with tuberculous meningitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While tuberculous meningitis is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities should be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Bacterial Meningitis:** Although less likely given the CSF findings (low glucose), bacterial meningitis should be ruled out.\n",
      "*   **Cryptococcal Meningitis:** The negative cryptococcal antigen and culture make this less likely, but it should still be considered, especially in an immunocompromised patient.\n",
      "*   **Viral Meningitis:** Viral meningitis typically presents with a more benign course and less severe CSF abnormalities.\n",
      "*   **Other causes of meningitis:** Fungal, parasitic, or other bacterial causes of meningitis should be considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The management of tuberculous meningitis is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Key aspects include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Prompt Diagnosis:** Early diagnosis is crucial to initiate treatment and prevent complications.\n",
      "*   **Empiric Treatment:** Start empiric treatment with anti-tuberculosis medications (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) immediately, even before definitive confirmation of the diagnosis.\n",
      "*   **Corticosteroids:** Corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) are often used to reduce inflammation and improve outcomes, especially in patients with basal ganglia infarctions.\n",
      "*   **Antifungal Therapy:** If cryptococcal meningitis is suspected, antifungal therapy (e.g., fluconazole) should be initiated.\n",
      "*   **Supportive Care:** Provide supportive care, including monitoring vital signs, managing complications (e.g., seizures, hydrocephalus), and providing nutritional support.\n",
      "*   **Long-Term Treatment:** Tuberculous meningitis requires prolonged treatment (typically 6-9 months or longer) to eradicate the infection.\n",
      "*   **Monitoring:** Close monitoring of the patient's clinical status, CSF parameters, and neurological function is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the patient's presentation, CSF findings, and HIV status strongly suggest tuberculous meningitis. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment are critical to improve the patient's outcome.**\n",

      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis for this 12-year-old boy from rural Kenya is **Trachoma**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a classic constellation of symptoms and signs consistent with trachoma:\n",

      "    *   Traditional medicine use (ecucuka plant)\n",
      "    *   Lid scarring, trichiasis (in-turned lashes), conjunctival scarring, corneal opacity, and a perforated corneal ulcer with iris adhesion (leucoma).\n",
      "    *   The presence of follicles on the tarsal conjunctiva, corneal scarring, and trichiasis are all key diagnostic features.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Risk Factors:** The patient lives in a rural, arid area with poor sanitation, limited access to clean water, and a history of using traditional eye medicine. These factors are all significant risk factors for trachoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Diagnostic Criteria:** The patient meets the WHO's diagnostic criteria for trachoma, specifically the presence of follicles, conjunctival scarring, trichiasis, and corneal opacity.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The boy presents with a classic triad of symptoms associated with measles:\n",
      "    *   Fever\n",
      "    *   Cough\n",
      "    *   Conjunctivitis\n",
      "*   **Rash:** The description of a fine maculopapular rash starting behind the ears and spreading to the face, trunk, and limbs is highly characteristic of measles.\n",
      "*   **Other Symptoms:** Coryza (runny nose) and lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) are also common in measles.\n",
      "*   **Impaired Consciousness:** This can be a sign of measles encephalitis, a serious complication.\n",
      "*   **HIV Status:** The boy's HIV-positive status increases his risk of severe complications from measles.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):** The fact that he is not yet on ART makes him even more vulnerable.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Course:** The progression of the rash from behind the ears to the trunk and the development of scaling are consistent with measles.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While measles is the most likely diagnosis, other possibilities to consider include:\n",

      "    *   Vitamin A supplementation (to prevent blindness and death).\n",
      "    *   Antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections (e.g., pneumonia).\n",
      "*   **Isolation:** The child should be isolated to prevent the spread of the virus.\n",
      "*   **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):** Starting ART is crucial to improve the child's immune function and reduce the risk of complications.\n",
      "*   **Monitoring:** Close monitoring for signs of complications, such as encephalitis or pneumonia.\n",
      "*   **Vaccination:** If possible, the child should be vaccinated against measles, but this should be delayed until immune reconstitution is achieved with ART.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the clinical presentation strongly suggests measles in this 6-year-old boy from Malawi, and prompt management with supportive care, ART, and monitoring for complications is essential.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Melioidosis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Patient Profile:** A 44-year-old male farmer from Laos, a region known to be endemic for Melioidosis.\n",
      "*   **Symptoms:** Fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and a painful swelling on the back. These are consistent with the varied presentations of Melioidosis.\n",
      "*   **Diabetes:** Diabetes is a significant risk factor for Melioidosis.\n",
      "*   **Clinical Findings:** Septic appearance, fever, jaundice, crepitations, and reduced breath sounds suggest a severe infection with possible lung involvement.\n",
      "*   **Abscess:** The presence of a pus-filled abscess is a hallmark of Melioidosis.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Results:** Elevated WBC count, elevated liver enzymes, and jaundice support the diagnosis of a severe infection.\n",
      "*   **Imaging:** Chest radiograph showing pleural effusions further supports the possibility of lung involvement.\n",
      "*   **Culture Results:** Isolation of *Burkholderia pseudomallei* from the abscess and blood cultures confirms the diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Differential Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Bacterial Abscess with Sepsis:** While a bacterial abscess is possible, the presence of *Burkholderia pseudomallei* makes Melioidosis the more likely diagnosis.\n",
      "*   **Tuberculosis:** Tuberculosis can cause abscesses, but the patient's presentation is less typical for TB (e.g., no history of TB exposure, lack of cold abscess).\n",
      "*   **Fungal Infection:** Less likely given the patient's history and the isolation of *Burkholderia pseudomallei*.\n",
      "*   **Other Infections:** Other infections could be considered, but the combination of factors points strongly towards Melioidosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Investigations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Throat Swabs:** To rule out other bacterial infections.\n",
      "*   **Sputum Sample:** If there is pulmonary involvement, to assess for TB or other respiratory infections.\n",
      "*   **Chest Radiograph (CXR):** To evaluate for pneumonia or other lung abnormalities.\n",
      "*   **Abdominal Ultrasound:** To look for liver or splenic abscesses, which are common in Melioidosis.\n",
      "*   **Blood Culture:** To monitor the patient's response to treatment.\n",
      "*   **Further Imaging:** CT or MRI scan of the abdomen or chest may be needed to assess the extent of the infection.\n",
      "*   **Serology:** Although not very sensitive or specific, serological tests can be helpful in endemic areas.\n",
      "*   **PCR:** PCR assays on clinical specimens can provide a more rapid diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the patient's clinical presentation, risk factors, and laboratory findings strongly suggest a diagnosis of Melioidosis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to improve the patient's outcome.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (TB)** in an HIV-positive patient with advanced immunosuppression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a chronic cough, night sweats, and weight loss, which are classic TB symptoms.\n",
      "*   **HIV Status:** The patient's HIV-positive status significantly increases the likelihood of TB, especially with advanced immunosuppression.\n",
      "*   **CD4 Count:** The CD4 count of 54 cells/μL indicates advanced immunosuppression, which is a major risk factor for atypical TB presentations.\n",
      "*   **Chest Radiography:** The chest radiograph showing a prominent hilar region is consistent with TB lymphadenopathy.\n",
      "*   **Sputum Smear:** The negative sputum smear is typical of smear-negative TB in HIV-infected individuals.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Response to Antibiotics:** The patient's lack of response to oral antibiotics suggests a non-bacterial cause, such as TB.\n",
      "*   **Other Considerations:** While other conditions like PCP, KS, and malignancy are possible, they are less likely given the overall clinical picture and the patient's risk factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Approach:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Empiric Treatment for TB:** Given the high suspicion for TB and the patient's advanced immunosuppression, initiating empirical treatment for smear-negative TB is warranted. The standard regimen is typically isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R), pyrazinamide (P), and ethambutol (E).\n",
      "2.  **Consider Prednisolone:** Adding prednisolone during the first 4 weeks of antituberculous treatment is recommended to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).\n",
      "3.  **Further Investigations:**\n",
      "    *   **Sputum Culture:** Sputum culture should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and identify drug-resistant TB.\n",
      "    *   **PCR for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*:** PCR testing of sputum can be used to detect *M. tuberculosis* DNA.\n",
      "    *   **HIV Viral Load and CD4 Count:** Monitoring the patient's HIV viral load and CD4 count is essential to assess the response to treatment and adjust antiretroviral therapy as needed.\n",
      "    *   **Consider other investigations:** If the patient does not respond to treatment, consider other investigations such as bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to rule out other causes of lung disease.\n",
      "4.  **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):** Initiate ART as soon as possible, ideally within the first 8 weeks of starting antituberculous treatment.\n",
      "5.  **Monitoring:** Closely monitor the patient's clinical response to treatment, including fever, cough, and weight loss.\n",
      "6.  **Education:** Educate the patient about TB, HIV, and the importance of adherence to treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Drug Resistance:** Given the patient's advanced immunosuppression, there is a higher risk of drug-resistant TB.\n",
      "*   **IRIS:** Be vigilant for signs of IRIS, which can occur during the initial phase of treatment.\n",
      "*   **Multidisciplinary Approach:** Management of HIV/TB co-infection requires a multidisciplinary approach involving physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and social workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Disclaimer:** This diagnosis and approach are based solely on the information provided and should not be considered a substitute for a comprehensive clinical evaluation by a qualified healthcare professional.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Lymphocutaneous Sporotrichosis**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Presentation:** The patient presents with a chronic ulcer on the hand, followed by the development of multiple painless nodules along the lymphatic tract. This is a classic presentation of sporotrichosis.\n",
      "*   **Geographic Location:** Peru is an endemic area for sporotrichosis.\n",
      "*   **Lack of Improvement with Antimonials:** The patient failed to respond to a course of pentavalent antimonials, which is a common treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis. This makes leishmaniasis less likely.\n",
      "*   **Negative Leishmanin Skin Test:** A negative leishmanin skin test further reduces the likelihood of leishmaniasis.\n",
      "*   **Positive Culture:** The positive culture for *Sporothrix schenckii* confirms the diagnosis of sporotrichosis.\n",

       "[\"1 A 20-Year-Old Woman from Sudan With Fever, Haemorrhage and Shock DANIEL G. BAUSCH Clinical Presentation History A 20-year-old housewife presents to a hospital in northern Uganda with a 2-day history of fever, severe asthenia, chest and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and slight non-productive cough. The patient is a Sudanese refugee living in a camp in the region. She denies any contact with sick people. Clinical Findings The patient is prostrate and semiconscious on admission. Vital signs: temperature 39.6°C, (103.3°F) blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, pulse 90bpm, and respiratory rate 24 cycles per minute. Physical examination revealed abdominal ten- derness, especially in the right upper quadrant, hepatosple- nomegaly and bleeding from the gums. The lungs were clear. No rash or lymphadenopathy was noted. Questions 1. Is the patient's history and clinical presentation consistent with a haemorrhagic fever (HF) syndrome? 2. What degree of nursing precautions need to be implemented? Discussion This patient was seen during an outbreak of Ebola virus dis- ease in northern Uganda, so the diagnosis was strongly sus- pected. She was admitted to the isolation ward that had been established as part of the international outbreak response. No clinical laboratory data were available because, for biosafety reasons, such testing was suspended. Although it is a reasonable precaution, the suspension of routine testing often causes difficulty in ruling out the many other febrile syn- dromes in the differential diagnosis and increases mortality from other non-Ebola disease. Fortunately, many clinical lab- oratory tests can now be safely performed with point-of-care instruments, often brought into a specialized laboratory in the isolation ward, as long as the laboratory personnel are properly trained and equipped. Answer to Question 1 Is the Patient's History and Clinical Presentation Consistent with an HF Syndrome? The clinical presentation is indeed one of classic viral HF. However, most times the diagnosis is not so easy. Although some patients, such as this one, do progress to the classic syn- drome with haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction syn- drome and shock, haemorrhage is not invariably seen (and may even be noted in only a minority of cases with some virus species), and severe and fatal disease may still occur in its absence. The clinical presentation of viral HF is often very non-specific. Furthermore, haemorrhage may be seen in numerous other syndromes, such as complicated malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis and leptospirosis, which are the primary differential diagnoses, depending on the region. Answer to Question 2 What Degree of Nursing Precautions Needs to be Implemented? The spread of Ebola virus between humans is through direct contact with blood or bodily fluids. Secondary attack rates are generally 15% to 20% during outbreaks in Africa, and much lower if proper universal precautions are maintained. Specialized viral HF precautions and personal protective equipment are warranted when there is a confirmed case or high index of suspicion, such as in this case. The Case Continued... Intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics and analge- sics were begun on admission. Nevertheless, the patient's condition rapidly worsened, with subconjunctival haemor- rhage, copious bleeding from the mouth, nose and rectum tình hình bệnh của khu vực 1 2 CHAPTER 1 A 20-Year-Old Woman from Sudan With Fever, Haemorrhage and Shock • Fig. 1.1 Oral bleeding in Ebola virus disease.

She became comatose and died approximately 24 hours after admission. SUMMARY BOX Filoviral Diseases Ebola and Marburg virus disease are the two syndromes caused by filoviruses. Microvascular instability with capillary leak and impaired haemostasis, often including disseminated intravascular coagulation, are the pathogenic hallmarks. There are four known pathogenic species of Ebola and one of Marburg virus, with rel- atively consistent case fatality associated with each species, ranging from 25% to 85%. Ebola and Marburg diseases are generally indistinguishable, both with non-specific presentations typically including fever, headache, asthenia, myalgias, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Conjunctival injection and subconjunctival haemorrhage are common. A fleeting maculo- papular rash is occasionally seen. Typical laboratory findings include mild lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, and elevated hepatic transaminases, with AST > ALT. Leucocytosis may be seen in late stages. The differential diagnosis is extremely broad, including almost all febrile diseases common in the tropics. Ebola and Marburg virus diseases are endemic in sub- Saharan Africa, with Ebola virus typically found in tropical rain- forests in the central and western parts of the continent and Marburg virus in the drier forest or savannah in the east. Evidence strongly implicates fruit bats as the filovirus reservoir, especially the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) as the reservoir for Marburg virus. Human infection likely occurs from inadvertent exposure to infected bat excreta or saliva. Male-to-female sexual transmission may occur months after infection because of the virus's persistence in the semen, although these events are relatively rare. Miners, spelunkers, forestry workers and others with expo- sure in environments typically inhabited by bats are at risk, especially for Marburg virus disease. Non-human primates, especially gorillas and chimpanzees, and other wild animals may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit filoviruses to humans through contact with their blood and bodily fluids, usually asso- ciated with hunting and butchering. These wild animals are pre- sumably also infected by exposure to bats and usually develop severe and fatal disease similar to human viral HF. Most outbreaks are thought to result from a single or very few human introductions from a zoonotic source followed by nosocomial amplification through person-to-person transmission in a setting of inadequate universal precautions, usually in rural areas of countries where civil unrest has decimated the healthcare infrastructure. Because symptoms are generally non-specific and laboratory testing is not widely available, viral HF outbreaks are usually recognized only if a cluster of cases occurs, especially when healthcare workers are involved. Having been into caves or mines, and direct or indirect contact with wild animals or people with suspected viral HF, are key diagnostic clues, but these are not uniformly present. Outside consultation with experts in the field and testing of suspected cases should be rapidly undertaken and public health authorities must be alerted. Contact tracing should be undertaken to identify all persons with direct unprotected exposure with the case patient, with surveillance of contacts for fever for 21 days (the maximum incubation period for Ebola and Marburg virus diseases). Any contact developing fever or showing other signs of viral HF should immediately be isolated and tested. Treatment is supportive. Antimalarials and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given until the diagnosis of viral HF is con- firmed. Preliminary results from a clinical trial of experimental compounds conducted during an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo show very promising results, reducing case fatality to as low as 10% if treatment is administered early in the course of disease. Similarly, a clinical trial of an Ebola vaccine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and during the massive 2013 to 2016 outbreak in West Africa showed protective efficacy of over 90%.

       " \"10 A 55-Year-Old Indigenous Woman from Australia With a Widespread Exfoliating Rash and Sepsis BART J. CURRIE AND JAMES MCCARTHY Clinical Presentation History You are working in a remote indigenous community in tropical northern Australia, and the community health worker asks you to visit a house to assess an elderly woman who has been living in the crowded back room. Her family are worried that she has become increasingly withdrawn and hasn't been getting out of the house much at all. Clinical Findings The patient is a 55-year-old indigenous Australian woman with a widespread exfoliative rash involving all limbs and especially the armpits, buttocks and thighs (Fig. 10.1). Many flakes of skin cover the mattress she is lying on. In addition, she has fissures over her wrists and knees. She also looks pale, is clammy and poorly responsive. Her temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), heart rate 110bpm, respiratory rate 28 breath cycles per minute and blood pressure 85 mmHg systolic to radial pulsation. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is 92% on room air. Laboratory Results You take blood cultures, full blood count, CRP and biochemistry. Samples are sent into the regional laboratory, with results expected the next day. You also take skin scrapings, which you can look at yourself using the community clinic microscope. Questions 1. What is your provisional diagnosis? 2. What is your initial management? Discussion A 55-year-old indigenous Australian woman has a widespread exfoliating rash and is clearly systemically unwell with signs of sepsis. • Fig. 10.1 Severe crusted scabies of the right axilla and chest wall. 24 CHAPTER 10 A 55-Year-Old Indigenous Woman from Australia With a Widespread Exfoliating Rash and Sepsis 25 Answer to Question 2 What is Your Initial Management? She is transported to the community health centre where you put her on oxygen, insert a wide-bore cannula, take an additional set of blood cultures, give her 1 litre of normal saline over 30 minutes and commence her on intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone 2 g and gentamicin 320 mg (her weight is 62 kg). The Case Continued... After the IV fluids, her blood pressure rose to 95 mmHg systolic and her oxygen saturation was 97% with oxygen by nasal prongs. She was evacuated to the regional hospital. In the clinic, microscopy of her skin scrapings under low- power magnification confirmed the diagnosis, showing multiple scabies mites of varying maturity and multiple eggs. In the hospital, the patient was managed in a single room with enhanced contact precautions to prevent transmission of scabies to staff and visitors. Treatment consisted of a five-dose course of ivermectin (200 μg/kg/dose) on days 0, 1, 7, 8 and 14, together with a topical scabicide (benzyl benzoate 25%) applied every second day for the first week, then twice weekly for the second week, with a keratolytic cream (lactic acid and urea in sorbolene cream) after bathing on the days the topical scabicide was not administered. Her blood cultures, taken in the community grew S. aureus resistant to flucloxacillin and clindamycin, but sensitive to gentamicin, co-trimoxazole and doxycycline (i.e. community-acquired MRSA). She was therefore given 2 weeks of IV vancomycin. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no features of endocarditis. Repeated blood cultures 48 hours after admission were negative, and by that stage she was afebrile, off oxygen and eating well. While she was in the hospital, all her family members were treated in the community with topical permethrin 5%, given as two doses 1 week apart, and the children with skin sores were each given a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin, with excellent response. • Fig. 10.2 Fissure over the wrist with underlying less severe crusted scabies. The household clothes, linen and furniture were put out in the sun for a day, and the rooms were treated with a commercial insecticide residue. The woman returned to the community after 3 weeks in the hospital, with her skin showing no residual hyperkeratosis or shedding. She and the family are followed up regularly by the health staff to allow early diagnosis and treatment should she again be infected with scabies. SUMMARY BOX Crusted Scabies Although Sarcoptes scabiei infection and mite reproduction is usually self-limiting, hyperinfestation can develop in susceptible individuals. Crusted or Norwegian scabies was first described in patients with leprosy in Norway. Crusted scabies can occur after immunosuppressive therapy in transplantation, haematological malignancy, chemotherapy for malignancy and in infection with HIV and HTLV-1. It can also occur in malnutrition, Down's syndrome and in the elderly and institutionalized, especially those with physical or cognitive disability who are unable to scratch. Patients with crusted scabies can have many thousands of mites in skin fissures and can serve as 'core transmitters' for continuing outbreaks of scabies in communities and nursing homes. Mites from crusted scabies cases are not genetically distinct, with ordinary scabies occurring in those infected from these cases. Crusted scabies results from unfettered mite reproduction and host reaction, resulting in formation of hyperkeratotic skin crusts. The rash is widespread and can be very adherent. Skin flakes with thousands of mites can be shed on to bed linen and floors. Although hands and feet are most commonly involved, the distribution is often extensive, including neck, face and scalp, as well as axillae, trunk, buttocks and limbs, especially knees and elbows. Thick deposits of debris with mites accumulate beneath the nails, which are often thickened and dystrophic. Crusting can be limited to one or two limbs, hands or fingers. Unlike ordinary scabies, where itching is usually intense, the presence of itch is variable in crusted scabies. Fissuring and secondary bacterial infection are common (Fig. 10.2). A peripheral blood eosinophilia is common but not always present, and serum IgE levels are often extremely high. There is high mortality in crusted scabies cases from secondary bacterial sepsis, including due to Gram-negative organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa in addition to S. pyogenes and/or S. aureus. The differential diagnoses of crusted scabies include psoriasis, extensive tinea corporis, skin malignancies such as the T cell lymphomas mycosis fungoides and the Sézary syndrome, nutritional deficiencies such as pellagra, pemphigus, kava dermopathy, onchocerciasis, lepromatous leprosy and secondary syphilis.

       " \"A 45-Year-Old Male Security Guard from Malawi With Difficulties in Walking and Back Pain\\n\\nJURI KATCHANOV\\n\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 45-year-old security guard from Malawi is admitted to a local tertiary hospital because of back pain and progressive difficulty in walking.\\nHis troubles started 1 year earlier with back pain and he presented to a local health centre. He was given paracetamol and sent home. The pain did not improve. Over the following weeks he also developed difficulty in walking and 'pins and needles' sensation in his legs.\\nThree months after the first visit he presented again to the same health centre. His temperature was slightly elevated (37.5°C, 99.5°F). He was given antimalarials, a single dose of praziquantel and paracetamol. He consulted a local traditional healer who applied tattoos to his chest and his back (Fig. 11.1A). Over the following 6 months his condition further deteriorated and he finally became bedridden.\\nThe patient denies fever, night sweats and weight loss, and there is no chronic cough. There is neither haematuria nor diarrhoea and he is continent for stool and urine. There is no history of trauma or past tuberculosis (TB). He has never been tested for HIV.\\nHe is a non-smoker, but drinks two paper cartons (about one litre) of Chibuku, a locally brewed beer, per day. He is married with three children, who are all well. He resides in an urban area and used to work as a security guard but has been unemployed for the last 6 months because of his illness.\\n\\nClinical Findings\\nHe looks well and is afebrile with normal vital signs. There is tenderness over the lower thoracic spine and severe spasticity of both legs (Fig. 11.1B). The power in his legs is 1/5 (visible muscle flicker). Deep tendon reflexes of the lower limbs are exaggerated. The plantar reflexes are upgoing. There is a sensory level for pain and temperature sensation between T9 and T11, with diminished joint sense in his big toes bilaterally. The examination of his cranial nerves and the upper limbs is normal.\\n\\nLaboratory Results\\nHis Full blood count results are normal.\\n\\nQuestions\\n1. What is the neuroanatomical syndrome and what is your differential diagnosis?\\n2. What further management should be carried out?\\n\\nDiscussion\\nA 45-year-old Malawian man presents with chronic back pain and slowly progressive spastic paraparesis. On examination there is tenderness over the lower thoracic spine and a thoracic sensory level. He denies any constitutional symptoms. His past medical history is unremarkable. His HIV status is unknown.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat is the Neuroanatomical Syndrome and What is Your Differential Diagnosis?\\nThe clinical signs – spastic paraparesis with hyperreflexia, upgoing plantar reflexes and thoracic sensory level – localize the lesion to the spinal cord. The bladder is usually involved in spinal cord disease, but the absence of bladder symptoms does not rule out spinal cord involvement, particularly in slowly progressive lesions, as in our case.\\nSpinal cord disease can be traumatic or non-traumatic. Nothing in the patient's history suggests trauma. Non-traumatic spinal cord disease can be compressive or non-compressive. Compressive disease is sometimes amenable to spinal surgery.\\nCommon causes of adult non-traumatic compressive spinal cord disease in sub-Saharan Africa are spinal TB (‘Pott's disease'), spinal metastases and degenerative spinal disease including slipped disc. Common causes of non-compressive spinal cord disease are schistosomiasis, autoimmune transverse myelitis and HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat is the Further Management?\\nThe diagnosis of spinal cord disease in resource-limited settings is often clinical (Table 11.1). Management should focus on diagnosis and treatment of the underlying aetiology and on prevention and treatment of the complications of spinal cord disease. Diagnostic clues and possible treatment regimens are summarized in Table 11.2.\\nAll patients should be tested for HIV, ova of Schistosoma spp. in urine and stool and evidence of TB or neoplasia on chest- and spinal radiography. If available, ultrasound examination of the abdomen is very valuable in tumour-screening and TB work-up. CSF should be examined, which is of particular importance in immunosuppressed patients.\\nRealistically, most patients admitted to hospital with paraplegia because of spinal cord disease will leave the hospital paraplegic. The prognosis is overall poor, and often the secondary complications rather than the primary pathology dictate the further course of the disease. The prevention of complications of spinal cord disease is therefore of paramount importance. Health workers should work hand in hand with guardians, physiotherapists and the local palliative care team (Table 11.3).\\n\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe patient was found to be HIV-positive. His urine dipstick was normal and there were no ova of Schistosoma spp. detected in his urine and stool. The spinal radiograph showed a collapse of T11 vertebral body as well as soft tissue swelling around the spine (Fig. 11.2). Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound examination were normal.\\nand the patient was started on standard first-line antituberculous treatment. Vitamin B6 was prescribed to prevent peripheral neuropathy. Physiotherapy and intensive guardian counselling were initiated at the hospital. The patient was reviewed by a spinal surgeon who did not recommend surgical intervention at that time, but suggested a review 3 months later. The patient was discharged home. The hospital palliative care team was involved and put him on their list for monthly home visits.\\nAt 4 weeks he was followed up in the HIV outpatient clinic. His neurological deficits were unchanged. His CD4 count was 331 cells/µL and he was started on antiretroviral therapy.\\nAt the 3-month follow-up by the palliative care team, the patient reported some subjective improvement in his gait. Clinically though, his deficits remained unchanged. He was taking his antituberculous and antiretroviral medication regularly and was still waiting for a wheelchair. He did not attend the neurosurgical outpatient clinic because of problems with transportation.\",\n",
       " 'A 29-Year-Old Man from The Gambia With Genital Ulceration\\n\\nDAVID C.W. MABEY\\n\\nClinical Presentation\\n\\nHistory\\nA 29-year-old man comes to your clinic in The Gambia com\\xadplaining of painful sores involving his private parts for 7 days. He has been previously well. He admits to having had sex with a commercial sex worker 2 weeks ago, when he had not used a condom.\\n\\nClinical Findings\\nHe is in considerable pain and is only able to walk with dif\\xadficulty because of these sores. He is afebrile and well nour\\xadished. General examination is unremarkable. The only abnormality is the presence of numerous painful ulcers on his penis, scrotum and inner thigh (Fig. 12.1). The ulcers are tender, soft and bleed on contact. There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy.\\n\\nQuestions\\n1. What are the most important differential diagnoses?\\n2. How would you manage this patient?\\n\\n• Fig. 12.1 Numerous painful ulcers on the penis, scrotum and inner thigh. The ulcers are soft, tender and bleed on contact.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nA 29-year-old Gambian man presents with genital ulcers which he has developed over the past week. He admits to having had unprotected sex with a commercial sex worker 2 weeks previously.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Are the Most Important Differential Diagnoses?\\nThe three major causes of genital ulceration are Herpes sim\\xadplex, syphilis and chancroid. Ulcers caused by H. simplex are self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals, and do not usually last longer than a few days. They can be severe and persistent in the immunocompromised. Ulcers caused by primary syphilis are usually painless, and it is unusual for there to be more than a single ulcer. Inguinal adenopathy is sometimes seen but is usually painless. Ulcers caused by chancroid are often multiple, and usually painful. In some 50% of cases painful inguinal lymphadenopathy is found. Inguinal buboes may be fluctuant and sometimes rupture, releasing large amounts of pus.\\nHowever, the clinical diagnosis of genital ulcer disease is unreliable. For this reason, the patient should be treated syn\\xaddromically for both syphilis and chancroid. If he is HIV-positive, additional treatment for herpes should also be considered.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow Would You Manage This Patient?\\nTreat him for syphilis with a single dose of IM benzathine pen\\xadicillin 2.4 million units. Treat him for chancroid with a single dose of azithromycin 1 g PO or ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid for 3 days or erythromycin 500mg qds for 7 days. If he is HIV-positive, consider adding aciclovir 400 mg tds for 7 days.\\nHe is at high risk of HIV because he has acquired a genital ulcer from a commercial sex worker, so you should test him for HIV and start antiretroviral treatment if positive. Serol\\xadogy for syphilis will be helpful in guiding treatment for his sexual partners, but he should be treated for syphilis even if it is negative, because serology can be negative in early primary syphilis. He should be strongly encouraged to bring his sex\\xadual partners to the clinic for assessment and treatment.',\n",
       " '13\\nA 16-Year-Old Girl from Malawi With Fever and Abdominal Pain\\nCAMILLA ROTHE\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 16-year-old Malawian girl presents to the emergency room of a local hospital because of fever, generalized abdominal pain and frontal headache for the past 5 days.\\nShe delivered a baby 5 months ago. An HIV test done in the antenatal clinic was negative. Her further past medical history is unremarkable.\\nShe lives with her parents, her three siblings and her baby in an urban high-density area. There is no running water and no electricity in the house. The family fetch water from a community tap. The girl went to primary school but recently dropped out during her pregnancy.\\nClinical Findings\\n16-year-old girl in a fair nutritional state. Temperature 38.1°C (100.6°F), blood pressure 110/60mmHg, pulse 78 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breath cycles per minute, Glasgow Coma Scale 15/15. There is mild scleral jaundice, no neck stiffness. The examination of the abdomen shows diffuse tenderness but no guarding. The liver is not enlarged, the spleen is palpable at 2cm below the left costal margin. The chest is clear and there is no lymphadenopathy. Pelvic examination is unremarkable and there is no vaginal discharge.\\nInvestigations\\nHer laboratory results on admission are shown in Table 13.1. The blood film for malaria parasites is positive, parasitaemia is described as \"low\". Liver function tests are not available because reagents are out of stock.\\nQuestions\\nWhat are your most important differential diagnoses?\\nHow would you approach this patient?\\nDiscussion\\nA 16-year-old girl presents with fever, abdominal pain and frontal headache. She has recently delivered a baby, otherwise her past medical history is unremarkable.\\nShe is febrile, mildly jaundiced and there is diffuse abdominal tenderness with slight splenomegaly. There is mild normocytic anaemia. Malaria parasites are positive with low parasitaemia.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Are Your Most Important Differential Diagnoses?\\nMalaria could explain most of her signs and symptoms, even though her abdominal pain would be unusual. However, in a malaria-endemic area where large parts of the population are semi-immune, low parasitaemia is common and often subclinical. Nevertheless, malaria itself, particularly if combined with severe anaemia, is a predisposing factor for Gram-negative bacteraemia and sepsis.\\nEnteric fever (typhoid or paratyphoid) is another diagnosis to consider, particularly given her abdominal tenderness, her splenomegaly, her frontal headache and her relative bradycardia. Mild jaundice in enteric fever may be caused by hepatitis, cholangitis, cholecystitis or haemolysis.\\nTABLE 13.1 Laboratory Results on Admission\\nParameter\\tPatient\\tReference\\nWBC (×109/L)\\t3.2\\t4-10\\nHaemoglobin (mg/dL)\\t10.9\\t12-14\\nMCV (fL)\\t90\\t80-99\\nPlatelets (×109/L)\\t164\\t150-400\\nCreatinine (µmol/L)\\t71\\t<80\\nIn HIV-positive patients an infection with invasive non-typhoidal salmonellae (iNTS) should be considered.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow Would You Approach This Patient?\\nBlood cultures should be taken in any febrile patient regardless of the malaria test result to rule out bacterial sepsis and enteric fever. Her HIV test should be repeated.\\nSince she is symptomatic and has malaria parasites in her blood, she should receive antimalarials according to the national guidelines and the local resistance profile. She should also be given broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for Gram-negative and, less likely, Gram-positive bacteria. A urinary dipstick could quickly help rule out a urinary tract infection.\\nAn abdominal ultrasound should be done to rule out post-hepatic causes of jaundice and to assess texture and size of liver and spleen.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nOn admission the patient was started on artemether/lumefantrine PO and a broad-spectrum antibiotic (ceftriaxone 2g IV od). A repeat HIV test was negative. Blood cultures grew Salmonella Typhi. The antibiotic therapy was switched to ciprofloxacin 500mg bid. On day 5 of antibiotic treatment the patient\\'s fever started to settle and she was feeling better. She was discharged on day 7. Ciprofloxacin was continued for a total of 10 days. The patient was also given one dose of praziquantel, because co-infection with schistosomiasis seems to favour chronic carriage of S. Typhi and relapse, and Malawi is a country highly endemic for schistosomiasis.\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nTyphoid Fever\\nTyphoid fever caused by Salmonella Typhi is an exclusively human disease and there is no animal reservoir. Typhoid is clinically indistinguishable from paratyphoid, caused by S. Paratyphi A, B and C.\\nThe enteric fevers, typhoid and paratyphoid, are endemic all over the tropical world. Incidence appears to be highest on the Indian subcontinent (approx. 500:100 000 per year in urban slums).\\nIn endemic countries, enteric fevers are most common in children and adolescents, whereas adults have acquired immunity through previous exposures. Typhoid is usually acquired through ingestion of food or water contaminated by faeces of a patient or carrier. Overcrowding and poor sanitation are major risk factors.\\nThe incubation period of typhoid fever averages 10 to 20 days (range 3-56). It is shorter in paratyphoid (1-10 days).\\nSymptoms are nonspecific with fever, headache, dry cough and abdominal pain. Other than in malaria, fever starts insidiously and may go unnoticed by the patient for some time. Temperature typically rises in the evening hours and patients may be afebrile in the morning. Constipation is common, but foul-smelling diarrhoea may occur during the course of an untreated infection. Patients may become confused and apathetic and, if untreated, may die of myocarditis, overwhelming toxaemia, intestinal perforation or haemorrhage.\\nFull blood count typically shows leukopenia. Low-grade anaemia and thrombocytopenia as well as slightly elevated transaminases are also common, but non-specific.\\nThe definitive diagnosis of typhoid requires proof of S. Typhi in blood cultures or bone marrow. Isolation from stool or urine indicates carrier state but does not prove disease. The serological Widal test lacks both sensitivity and specificity and should be abandoned altogether. Novel and more promising serological tests are under development. Meanwhile, blood culture remains the diagnostic gold standard. In many low-resource settings, blood culture testing is however unavailable.\\nPatients with suspected enteric fever should be started on empirical antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic resistance patterns vary considerably between endemic areas. In many countries, antibiotic resistance is on the rise. Fluoroquinolones are the drugs of choice in areas without antimicrobial resistance because they reach very high intracellular concentrations. Third-generation cephalosporins or azithromycin should be used in South Asia where fluoroquinolone resistance is common.\\nDuration of treatment is between 1 and 2 weeks depending on the drug used. Case fatality rate on antibiotic treatment is <1%.\\nApart from public health measures to improve safe water supply and sanitation, targeted vaccination of high-risk populations seems to be a promising strategy to control typhoid fever. Typhoid conjugate vaccines which can also be applied to children <2 years of age seem to be promising.\\nFurther Reading\\n1. Feasey NA, Gordon MA. Salmonella Infections. In: Farrar J, editor.

How was the infection most likely acquired? Is there\\nan outbreak?\\n2. How is dehydration assessed and managed?\\n\\nDiscussion\\nA 22-year-old Bengali woman who has recently visited a reli-\\ngious festival is brought into hospital in a stuporous condi-\\ntion with a history of rapid onset of severe, acute watery\\ndiarrhoea. There is no fever, vomiting or abdominal pain.\\nShe is severely dehydrated and her electrolytes are deranged. A number of other people\\nwho attended the same festival have also fallen ill with\\ndiarrhoea.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nHow Was the Infection Most Likely Acquired? Is\\nThere an Outbreak?\\nCholera transmission is closely linked to inadequate environ-\\nmental management. Typical at-risk areas include peri-urban\\nslums where basic infrastructure is not available and rural and\\nurban areas in endemic countries where sanitation is limited,\\nincluding refugee camps. Additionally, natural disasters, as\\nwell as times of political and social unrest associated with a\\ncollapse of infrastructure, pose a risk of cholera.\\n\\nAn outbreak is defined as the occurrence of disease epi-\\nsodes in greater numbers than would be expected at a partic-\\nular time and place.\\nIn this case there seems to be a typical cholera outbreak.\\nThe source is most probably contaminated water consumed\\nfrom the containers during the festival, with the likelihood\\nthat unless control measures for disease prevention\\nand appropriate case management are instituted rapidly,\\nthere will be spread, significant morbidity and, possibly,\\nmortality.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow is Dehydration Assessed and Managed?\\nThe WHO has recommended an assessment based on the\\ngeneral clinical condition of the patient (Table 14.2).\\nDepending on their degree of fluid depletion, patients are\\nassigned to rehydration at home, supervised oral rehydration\\nor intravenous rehydration (Table 14.3).\\nAdequate fluid and electrolyte replacement are the corner-\\nstones of cholera management and differ substantially from\\nthe approaches to patients with gastroenteritis of other aeti-\\nologies.

The most com-\\nmon error is for clinicians to underestimate the speed and\\nvolume of fluids required for rehydration.\\nUp to 80% of sufferers can be treated successfully through\\nprompt administration of oral rehydration salts (WHO/\\nUNICEF ORS standard sachets). In adults, 2 to 4 litres of\\nORS may be required in the first 4 hours.\\nPatients with severe cholera typically require an average of\\n200 mL/kg of isotonic oral or IV fluids in the first 24 hours\\n(Table 14.2). The initial fluid deficit should be replaced\\nwithin 3 to 4 hours of initial presentation. 10 to 20 mL/kg\\nbodyweight should be calculated for each diarrhoeal stool\\nor episode of vomiting.\\nAntibiotic therapy in cholera is secondary; but in patients\\nwith severe disease, appropriate antibiotics diminish the\\nduration of diarrhoea, reduce the volume of rehydration\\nfluids needed and shorten the duration of V. cholerae excre-\\ntion. In Bangladesh, resistance to furazolidone and tetracy-\\ncline is increasing.\\n\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe patient was admitted immediately and started on intra-\\nvenous rehydration with Ringer's lactate solution. After\\nreceiving 3 L in the first hour her pulse rate and blood pres-\\nsure picked up to 84bpm and 100/70 mmHg respectively.\\nOver the next 3 hours she was given an additional 2L and\\nbecame alert and responsive. She was then started on oral\\nrehydration and given a single dose of 300 mg doxycycline.\\nShe was discharged on the third day, by which time stool\\nconsistency had returned to normal.\\nThe local health authorities identified an additional 44\\ncases of cholera. All were treated, health education carried\\nout and the overhead tanks were chlorinated.\\n\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nCholera\\nCholera, caused by V. cholerae, is a major cause of acute\\ndehydrating diarrhoea, particularly in South and South-east Asia,\\nwhere it is endemic; it also occurs as large-scale outbreaks in\\nAfrica and Latin America.\\nV. cholerae is an aerobic Gram-negative bacillus with typical\\ndarting motility. Man is the only natural host of V. cholerae and\\n\\nasymptomatic carriage is possible. The main source of trans-\\nmission is from a contaminated water source. In some parts of the\\nworld, copepods are responsible for maintaining Vibrio spp. in a\\nviable but non-cultivable state.\\nThe incubation period ranges between 12 hours and 5 days.\\nPatients are usually afebrile and do not have any abdominal pain.\\nThe major clinical challenge is dehydration, ranging from mild to\\nsevere, and electrolyte imbalance leading on to renal failure in\\nsevere cases.\\nIn epidemics, the diagnosis of cholera may be presumptive on\\nclinical and epidemiological grounds following the WHO clinical\\ncase definition. Laboratory confirmation may be required when\\nsporadic cases occur or when an extensive outbreak requires\\nconfirmation and typing of the etiological agent.\\nTreatment typically involves isolation of the patient, correction\\nof dehydration and antimicrobial treatment. In most cases oral\\nreplacement solutions may be used. Antimicrobial therapy is\\nsecondary; it is shown to decrease shedding of the bacteria and\\nalso hastens clinical resolution of illness. Tetracycline and doxy-\\ncycline are the preferred drugs in adults, but ciprofloxacin or\\nmacrolides can also be used depending on availability and local\\nresistance pattern.\\nPublic health measures to improve water and sanitation\\nare essential for long-term control. WHO has endorsed the\\ninclusion of oral vaccines in cholera control programmes in\\nendemic areas in conjunction with other preventive and control\\nstrategies.\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n1.

       " '15 A 3-Year-Old Boy from Laos With Right Suppurative Parotitis SAYAPHET RATTANAVONG, VIRAVONG DOUANGNOULAK, BUACHAN NORINDR, PAUL N. NEWTON AND CAOIMHE NIC FHOGARTAIGH Clinical Presentation History A 3-year-old rural Lao boy presents to the ENT clinic with a 10-day history of gradual, painful swelling of the right cheek with associated fever and poor appetite. Three days previously his mother noticed a purulent discharge from the ear. He has no cough, vomiting or diarrhoea. There is no history of previous ear infection or dental problems and no known history of trauma. The child is developing normally and is up to date with vaccinations. His parents are rice farmers. Clinical Findings The child looks unwell, with a fever of 39.5°C (103.1°F). There is a localized, fluctuant, hot, tender swelling below and anterior to the right ear, 6 to 8 cm in diameter, extending from the lower cheek to the submandibular region and consistent with a parotid mass (Fig. 15.1). Ear examination reveals a purulent discharge in the auditory canal and suspicion of a small fistula from which the pus is arising, with a right lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy. The oral cavity and throat are unremarkable. There is no lymphadenopathy and no hepatosplenomegaly. Heart sounds are normal and the chest is clear. Laboratory Results WBC 16.5 ×109/L (4–10 x10º/L), 90% neutrophils. Hb 9.4g/dL (13-15g/dL), all other blood tests are normal. Questions 1. What are your differential diagnoses? 2. What investigations would you perform? Discussion A 3-year-old boy from rural Laos presents to a local hospital because of high fever, unilateral parotid swelling and purulent discharge from his ear. The little boy has previously been well. • Fig. 15.1 A Lao boy with a unilateral parotid mass showing signs of local inflammation. Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Differential Diagnoses? Acute, suppurative, unilateral parotitis in children is usually bacterial. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae, although the latter has declined because of widespread vaccination. Neonates are at risk of parotitis caused by Gram-negative bacteria, and Streptococcus pneumoniae parotitis may occur in HIV-infected children. In an endemic area like Laos, Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, must also be considered. Studies in neighbouring countries have shown melioidosis to be the commonest cause of suppurative parotitis in children. Actinomycosis and cat-scratch disease (Bartonella henselae) are more unusual bacterial causes. Mumps was the commonest cause of parotid swelling in children until the introduction of vaccination, which is still not commonly available in some countries, including Laos. Swelling is painful, but is non-suppurative and becomes bilateral in the majority of cases. Other less common viral agents causing parotitis include parainfluenza viruses, influenza A, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and enteroviruses, but these do not cause the degree of inflammation and suppuration seen here. Granulomatous parotitis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and other mycobacteria, is rare and presents with a more chronic, painless, enlarging mass without surrounding inflammation. Salivary stones and malignancies are very rare in children. Answer to Question 2 What Investigations Would You Perform? Samples for bacterial culture before commencing antimicrobial therapy are crucial. Gram stain and bacterial culture of pus from the ear are quick and non-invasive. Blood cultures should be taken because the results have therapeutic and prognostic implications. A throat swab may detect causative bacterial pathogens and has been used to diagnose melioidosis in children. Deep pus from incision and drainage of the parotid abscess is the most useful diagnostic material, and drainage may be necessary for management of the abscess. This may be performed under ultrasound guidance. Full blood count may help differentiate between bacterial and viral causes. When melioidosis is suspected, chest radiograph and abdominal ultrasound should be requested to look for other foci of infection. In this patient a radiograph of the skull would be useful to detect any osteomyelitis. The laboratory must be informed if melioidosis is suspected, because selective media are used to isolate B. pseudomallei from non-sterile sites, and suspected growth must be handled under containment level 3 conditions when available. If melioidosis is confirmed, investigations should look for underlying predisposing conditions such as diabetes mellitus, although these are found less commonly in children with B. pseudomallei parotitis than in adults with melioidosis.',\n",
       " \"16 A 25-Year-Old Female School Teacher from Malawi With Abrupt Onset of Fever and Confusion EMMA C. WALL Clinical Presentation History A 25-year-old Malawian primary school teacher presents to a local central hospital. She was reported to be well at 8 a.m., confused by 10 a.m. and drowsy with a high fever and con- vulsions on admission at 11 a.m. She is HIV-positive and has been on first-line antiretrovi- ral therapy (ART) with tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz for 6 months with good adherence. Her CD4 count on start- ing ART was 320 cells/µL. She completed treatment for pul- monary tuberculosis 2 months ago. Clinical Findings The patient is restless and agitated; Glasgow Coma Scale 10/ 15. Pupils are equal and reactive with photophobia; the neck is stiff and there is no rash. Plantar responses are down-going, Kernig's sign is positive. Chest and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. Temperature 40°C (104°F), pulse 125 bpm, blood pressure 125/68 mmHg, oxygen saturation 93% on room air. During the physical examination she suf- fers a renewed seizure. Laboratory Results Her blood results are shown in Table 16.1. A spinal tap is done. The CSF appears hazy; CSF results are shown in Table 16.2. Rapid antigen test for Plasmodium falciparum is negative. Questions 1. What are your treatment priorities for this woman? 2. What adjunctive interventions should be used in this setting?

Her CSF is hazy and shows a neutrophilic pleocytosis, as well as a high CSF-protein and low glucose. Bacterial meningitis is the most likely diagnosis; tubercu- lous meningitis and cryptococcal meningitis are possibilities, though much less likely, since they tend to present in a sub- acute manner. Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Treatment Priorities for This Woman? The suspected diagnosis is acute bacterial meningitis. In Africa Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of meningitis in adults and children. Additionally, in the meningitis belt, seasonal outbreaks of bacterial meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitis occur during the dry season. Case numbers have dropped considerably after the introduc- tion of large-scale vaccination programmes. The immediate treatment priority is emergency resuscita- tion, including rapid administration of antibiotics. A third- generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone at a high dose to penetrate the CSF is appropriate; where this is not available, high dose benzylpenicillin plus chloramphenicol is a suitable alternative. Resistance rates of S. pneumoniae to both penicil- lins and chloramphenicol are rising, hence local advice about resistance patterns should be sought. Data to guide resusci- tation in adults are limited, but airway support and seizure control are indicated. Public health services are required for case management to ensure that appropriate vaccination programmes and case notification for outbreak monitoring are done. Answer to Question 2 What Adjunctive Interventions Should be Used in This Setting and What Are Your Differential Diagnoses? Several meta-analyses suggest that while in well-resourced countries dexamethasone should be given to adults and chil- dren presenting to hospital with meningitis, steroids should not be used in resource-limited hospitals in Africa given their lack of efficacy. Glycerol has been tested in paediatric men- ingitis with mixed results but was shown to be harmful in adults with meningitis in Malawi. No other adjuncts have been tested in clinical trials to date; adjunctive treatment is not indicated. In cases of suspected meningitis, a lumbar puncture (LP) must be undertaken to obtain a diagnosis. Despite clinical contraindications to lumbar puncture in this patient (sei- zures and altered conscious level), the risk of causing harm by doing an LP is low. LP should not be delayed by attempts to obtain cerebral imaging unless obvious signs of a space- occupying lesion are present. CT scan of the brain is of lim- ited value in bacterial meningitis. Administration of antibi- otics should not be delayed while the LP is undertaken, particularly in resource-limited settings. The main differential diagnoses for this patient are cryp- tococcal meningitis (CCM) and TB meningitis (TBM). However, her CD4 count is too high for CCM and her recent completion of TB treatment makes TBM less likely. In addition, both of these infections classically have a more chronic course. She is not pregnant, therefore meningitis caused by Lis- teria monocytogenes is very unlikely. Bacterial pathogens that cause meningitis in HIV-infected adults include S. pneumo- niae, group A streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, invasive non-typhoidal salmonellae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae; all will be treated with a third- generation cephalosporin. European guidelines recommend 14 days of antibiotics in HIV-infected adults with bacterial meningitis. However, in sub-Saharan Africa often shorter courses are given, determined by the patient's recovery rate, local guidelines and availability of antibiotics for long courses. In children with bacterial meningitis in Malawi, 5 days of ceftriaxone was shown to be non-inferior to ten days, with substantial savings shown, and shorter courses are now commonly used. The Case Continued... In the emergency department the patient received ceftriax- one 2g IV, 10 mg of diazepam IV and 600 mg of phenobar- bitone IV. Her oxygen saturation improved with resuscitation. She received 10 days of IV ceftriaxone and recovered consciousness by day 3. Audiometry revealed a minor hearing loss in her right ear. No further neurological impairment or seizures were noted; anticonvulsants were weaned by day 3. SUMMARY BOX Acute Bacterial Meningitis In resource-rich settings, acute bacterial meningitis in adults and children is declining in incidence because of successful vaccination campaigns, but sporadic cases continue to occur. In contrast, many countries with high HIV prevalence have reported an increase in patients presenting with acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) since the start of the HIV epidemic. Case fatality rates in resource-rich settings have declined from 45-50% to 11-25% over the past 50 years, associated with early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and better sup- portive care. In contrast, adult ABM lethality rates in sub-Saharan Africa are reported to vary between 50 and 70% without any change over time, and survivors experience higher rates of neurological disabilities. Adjunctive treatments have failed to reduce lethality in large randomized controlled trials in Africa despite efficacy elsewhere. In well-resourced settings, important risk factors for poor outcome include advanced age, hyperglycaemia and immunosuppression. In Africa, coma, seizures, anaemia and delayed presentation to hospital are poor prognostic features. Antibiotic treatment depends on local sensitivities. A third-generation cephalosporin at high dose given as early as possible is the treatment of choice. Further Reading 1. Heckmann JE, Bhigjee AI. Tropical neurology. In: Farrar J, editor.

       " 'A 40-year-old man from Togo presents to a local clinic with a 4-year history of changes in both eyes without visual disturbances. He is worried because other adults in his village have gone blind from similar eye changes. For the past two decades, he has developed painless subcutaneous bumps and suffers from intense itching of his skin that disrupts his sleep. He has always lived in a village in the savannah near a fast-flowing river with common small biting flies. On examination, there are opacities in the cornea of both eyes. His skin is atrophic in some areas with multiple scratch marks. Firm, non-tender subcutaneous nodules, 1 to 3 cm in diameter, are palpable over bony prominences like the ribs, iliac crest, femoral trochanters, and on the head.',\n",
       " \"A 7-Year-Old Girl from Peru With a Chronic Skin Ulcer DALILA MARTÍNEZ, KRISTIEN VERDONCK, MARLEEN BOELAERT AND ALEJANDRO LLANOS-CUENTAS Clinical Presentation History A 7-year-old girl who lives in the Peruvian capital, Lima, is brought to a local clinic because of a chronic skin lesion on her nose. The lesion appeared 4 months ago as a small nodule and slowly turned into an ulcer. It is a bit itchy but not pain- ful. There is no history of trauma. The girl is otherwise healthy. Six months ago, she travelled to a valley on the western slopes of the Andes. Clinical Findings The lesion is a localized ulcer on the nose (Fig. 2.1). The bor- ders of the ulcer are indurated and there is a plaque-like infil- tration of the surrounding skin. The whole lesion is about 2 cm in diameter. There are no palpable lymph nodes. She is afebrile and the rest of the physical examination is normal. Questions 1. What are your differential diagnoses? 2. How would you approach this patient? • Fig. 2.1 Lesion at first consultation. Discussion A 7-year-old Peruvian girl presents with a painless ulcerative skin lesion on her nose, which has been present for the past 4 months. There are no systemic symptoms. Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Differential Diagnoses? Infectious diseases that can cause similar lesions in the face are cutaneous leishmaniasis, sporotrichosis, cutaneous tuber- culosis and infection by Balamuthia mandrillaris, a free-living amoeba. Although common bacterial infections of the skin that are partially treated or masked as a consequence of traditional remedies (e.g. chemical burns) are another possibility; this is less likely in our case given the chronic nature of the lesion. Cutaneous anthrax and tularaemia could be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions located on the extremities, but the latter is endemic in the Northern hemisphere only, and the long duration without any further symptoms does not fit with either infection. In addtion, cutaneous anthrax tends to present with considerable localized oedema not seen in this case. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a common, vector-borne, parasitic disease that affects people living in or travelling to endemic areas. It typically begins as a small papule on air- exposed parts of the skin, progresses to a nodule or plaque and then turns into an ulcer with raised borders. The ulcer is painless unless there is bacterial superinfection. Patients may have several lesions. Sporotrichosis is caused by Sporothrix schenckii, a dimor- phic fungus that is found in soil and on plants. It enters the skin through direct inoculation (e.g. thorny plants or animal scratch). The disease usually starts with a papule that turns into a tender ulcer. Lesions can spread along draining lym- phatic vessels. Sporotrichosis occurs throughout the world as a sporadic disease of farmers and gardeners. This disease is hyperendemic in parts of the Peruvian Andes, where it often affects children and typically produces facial lesions. However, our patient did not travel to such a hyper- endemic place. Cutaneous tuberculosis is an uncommon manifestation of tuberculosis. It occurs by direct inoculation of mycobacteria into the skin of non-sensitized individuals (e.g. children) or as a result of reactivation in persons with previous immunity against mycobacteria. As our patient lives in a poor neighbour- hood with a high incidence of tuberculosis, we cannot rule out this diagnosis. Not only Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but also environmental mycobacteria, Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium leprae can cause ulcerating skin lesions. B. mandrillaris is a free-living amoeba that may cause a highly fatal disease. It usually starts as a painless plaque, often after local trauma. Balamuthia lesions are characterized by reddish or purplish infiltrations; ulceration is uncommon. The most frequent location of the initial lesion is the central face, over the nose. In a few months, it can progress to the brain causing granulomatous amoebic encephalitis. If this occurs, the survival time is usually less than 8 weeks. The most likely diagnosis in our case is cutaneous leish- maniasis, because of the frequency of leishmaniasis in the val- ley our patient had travelled to and the characteristic presentation (localized painless ulcer with raised edges). Answer to Question 2 How Would You Approach This Patient? Gently clean the lesion with water, remove the scab and take a closer look at the process underneath. A definitive diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis requires the demonstration of the parasite through microscopic examination, culture or molec- ular techniques. The simplest approach is to scrape with a lancet under the edges of the lesion, and use the obtained material for a smear examination with Giemsa staining, looking for Leishmania amastigotes. The sensitivity of this technique is about 70%, decreasing as the duration of the lesion increases. The specificity is 100%. Culture can be done on samples obtained by fine-needle aspiration or biopsy taken from the edge of a lesion. In refer- ence centres, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to con- firm the presence of Leishmania and to identify the species. The Montenegro or leishmanin skin test detects delayed immune response against Leishmania antigens and is some- times used as a diagnostic aid. It can be negative in early stages of the disease and cannot distinguish current from past infection. If leishmaniasis is ruled out, the following tests can be use- ful for the diagnosis of alternative causes of our patient's lesion: smear microscopy and culture in Sabouraud's medium (for sporotrichosis), a purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test (for tuberculosis) and, if necessary, a histo- pathological examination of a biopsy specimen. The Case Continued... The scab was removed revealing an ulcer with cobblestone- patterned bottom and raised edges, typical of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The microscopic examination of a sample obtained by scraping was negative. The leishmanin skin test was positive. PCR was also positive; and the infecting species was identified as Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana. In addition, the girl received topical imiquimod therapy, which was administered every other day for 20 days. Imiquimod, is an immune-modulating drug, which may be used as part of the therapy for facial lesions and relapses. The response after 20 days of treatment was good (see Fig. 2.2). Treatment failure occurs in almost one quarter of patients after a first course of SSG monotherapy in Peruvian series, usually within 3 months. Follow-up is therefore recom- mended. Factors linked to treatment failure include young age and short stay in endemic area (as in this case) as well as recent onset of disease (<5 weeks), multiple lesions, and L. (V.) braziliensis infection (not present in this case). At the third month of follow-up, our patient did not have any signs of relapse (Fig. 2.3). The treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis is challenging because SSG has a high failure rate and several side effects, including myalgia, arthralgia, loss of appetite, nausea, fever, increased levels of liver and pancreatic enzymes, reactivation of varicella zoster virus and cardiotoxicity, which can lead to • Fig. 2.2 Follow-up image after 20 days of treatment. • Fig. 2.3 Follow-up image of the scar 3 months after the end of treatment. prolongation of QT-segment, severe arrhythmias and death. Information about the safety of this drug in children is lim- ited. It is also unclear from the literature if there are safe and effective alternatives to SSG in children with L. (V.) peruvi- ana infection. This is particularly relevant because, in endemic areas, cutaneous leishmaniasis often affects children. SUMMARY BOX Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. Some 20 Leishmania species are associated with human disease. CL can be anthroponotic or zoonotic (reservoir: small mammals). The parasite is transmitted by sand flies of the genus Lutzomyia (New World) and Phlebotomus (Old World). Of the estimated 1.5 million annual cases, 90% occur in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Brazil, Colombia and Peru. The incubation period between sand fly bite and appearance of skin lesions ranges from weeks to months. Clinical manifes- tations depend on characteristics of the parasite and the host immune response. Localized cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form. Some species of the Leishmania Viannia-complex can produce mucosal lesions resulting in disfiguring disease. The lesions can heal spontaneously; this is more common in Old World (>50%) than in New World leishmaniasis (<20%). The aim of treatment is to accelerate healing, reduce scarring and decrease the risk of metastasis and recurrence. Topical therapy is recommended for Old World CL and for New World CL caused by species not belonging to the Leishmania Viannia-complex. This topical approach consists of intralesional pentavalent antimony, paromomycin cream and/or cryo- or thermotherapy. Systemic therapy is indicated for CL caused by species of the Leishmania (Viannia)-complex, which may lead to disfiguring mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. In addition, systemic treatment should be given when lesions are extensive or when topical treatment fails. Pen- tavalent antimonials are the first-line systemic treatment of choice for all New World forms except L. guyanensis, for which pent- amidine is recommended. Miltefosine and azoles are alternatives. Amphotericin B deoxycholate and liposomal amphotericin B are second-line drugs. Further Reading 1. Boelaert M, Sundar S. Leishmaniasis. In: Farrar J, editor.

       " \"A 43-Year-Old Male Traveller Returning from Mozambique With Fever and Eosinophilia\\nGERD-DIETER BURCHARD\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 43-year-old German man presents to a local travel clinic on 21 May because of fever. He had been in Mozambique from 16 April to 30 April, and travelled to Chile afterwards from 30 April to 17 May. He did not take any malaria chemoprophylaxis in Mozambique and reports self-treatment for malaria with atovaquone/proguanil because of fever (27 April to 29 April). He is now complaining of recurrent fever for the past 3 days. The day before presentation his temperature was as high as 39.8°C (103.6°F). He also has some headache and diarrhoea.\\nHe reports freshwater contact in a small lake near Maputo. His past medical history is unremarkable.\\nClinical Findings\\n43-year-old male, febrile, with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F). The rest of the physical examination is normal and there is no rash, no hepatomegaly, no splenomegaly and no lymphadenopathy.\\nLaboratory Results\\nThe relevant laboratory results on admission are shown in Table 20.1.\\nFurther Investigations\\nElectrocardiogram is normal. Chest radiography reveals some nodular lesions ranging in size from 2 to 5mm in the periphery of the lower lung zones bilaterally (Fig. 20.1); this finding is confirmed by a CT scan of his chest.\\nTABLE 20.1 Laboratory Results on Admission\\nParameter Patient Reference\\nWBC (×10⁹/L) 9.0 4–11.3\\nEosinophils (×10⁹/L) 2.1 <0.5\\nLDH (U/L) 422 135–225\\nCreatinine (µmol/L) 88.4 53–106\\nAST/GOT (U/L) 106 10–50\\nALT/GPT (U/L) 179 10–50\\nGGT (U/L) 186 <65\\nC-reactive protein (mg/L) 57.9 <5\\n• Fig. 20.1 Chest radiograph showing nodular changes in the periphery of both lungs.\\nQuestions\\n1. What are your differential diagnoses and which investigations would you like to do?\\n2. What is the significance of eosinophilia in returning travellers?\\nDiscussion\\nA 43-year-old man presents with of a 3-day history of high fever. He has recently returned from a 5-week trip to Mozambique and Chile. He did not take any malarial chemoprophylaxis, but he took standby emergency treatment for presumed malaria when feeling febrile about 3 weeks ago. He reports freshwater contact in Mozambique. On examination he is febrile. His FBC shows eosinophilia with a normal total white cell count. His liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are slightly raised. Chest radiography and CT show small, nodular changes in the periphery of both lungs.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Are Your Differential Diagnoses and Which Investigations Would You Like to Do?\\nThe patient has travelled in Mozambique without taking any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Thus first of all malaria has to be excluded – irrespective of any other symptoms or laboratory results.\\nThe differential diagnosis of pyrexia in a returned traveller is long, but typhoid fever and amoebic liver abscess should always be excluded because they are common and potentially life-threatening diseases. Therefore blood cultures should be taken and an abdominal ultrasound should be done. In contrast to what was seen in this patient though, typhoid fever usually causes eosinopaenia.\\nThe further differential diagnosis of fever after a stay in tropical areas relies on the precise itinerary, the activities indulged in during travel, the presence of focal symptoms, signs and laboratory results.\\nThe patient has slightly elevated liver enzymes. The differential diagnosis of acute infections involving the liver includes viral hepatitis, including hepatitis E.\\nEBV and CMV infections may also cause fever, elevated liver enzymes and a rise in LDH. They are important differentials of fever in returned travellers. However, EBV and CMV cause lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, rather than eosinophilia. Splenomegaly is usually part of the clinical picture of mononucleosis and lymphadenopathy, even though the latter can be less prominent in acute CMV infection.\\nLeptospirosis, rickettsioses and Q-fever are bacterial infections to consider, as well as brucellosis, secondary syphilis and relapsing fever. Yet none of these infections as such would explain the patient's pronounced eosinophilia.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat is the Significance of Eosinophilia in Returning Travellers?\\nIn any patient returning from the tropics with eosinophilia, a helminth infection should be ruled out. The most relevant differential diagnosis in this patient who presents with eosinophilia and fever reporting freshwater contact is acute schistosomiasis, also known as Katayama syndrome. Another rare cause of fever, eosinophilia and elevated liver transaminases is acute fascioliasis.\\n• Fig. 20.2 Schistosoma mansoni egg.\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nAcute Schistosomiasis (Katayama Syndrome)\\nAcute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) is an acute hypersensitivity reaction caused by newly expressed antigens on developing worms. It is named after the Katayama region in Japan, where it was first described.\\nKatayama syndrome usually occurs 2 to 12 weeks after Schistosoma infection. It is characterized by fever, urticaria and a dry cough sometimes accompanied by a wheeze. Patchy pulmonary infiltrates or micronodular changes in the lower lung zones may be present on chest radiograph. Full blood count in the majority of cases shows eosinophilia, but of note, eosinophilia can occur with a delay of several weeks after the onset of symptoms and may be missed. Most patients recover spontaneously after 2 to 10 weeks. Rarely, neurological complications can occur, e.g. transverse myelitis, conus medullaris or cauda equina syndrome.\\nDiagnosis of acute schistosomiasis can be challenging. Schistosoma ova (Fig. 20.2) may still be absent from urine or stool at this early stage and serological tests can take up to 3 months to become positive. As a consequence, these investigations have to be repeated several times after the diagnosis has been clinically suspected. PCR-based methods are promising for the diagnosis of acute Schistosoma infection in recently primarily exposed populations such as travellers.\\nPraziquantel has a lack of activity against immature flukes and severe reactions have been reported after praziquantel treatment during the acute phase. Therefore antiparasitic treatment should be delayed until the flukes are adult, i.e. until eggs can be detected in stool or urine.\\nUnder certain circumstances, such as severe symptoms and in particular neurological complications, supportive steroid therapy may be useful in Katayama syndrome.\\nOf note, different stages of the parasite life cycle may overlap in a patient who is infected with many schistosomules. Therefore control examinations after several months are necessary and treatment with praziquantel may have to be repeated.\\nFurther Reading\\n1. Bustinduy AL, King CH. Schistosomiasis.

       " \"21\\nA 35-Year-Old American Man With Fatigue and a Neck Lesion\\nMARY E. WRIGHT AND ARTHUR M. FRIEDLANDER\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 35-year-old Caucasian male presents to a clinic in the United States with fatigue and a rash on his neck that started as a papule 2 days earlier. The lesion is non-pruritic, but it is associated with significant non-painful swelling and a pressure sensation in the neck. There is no history of fever, but the patient reports at least one episode of diaphoresis with mild confusion and headache.\\nThe patient recalls a break in the skin at the site of the lesion 3 days before while shaving and is sure that he has not been bitten by an insect. He has had no contact with animals and no foreign travel within the previous year.\\nHe had come to the clinic 24 hours earlier with similar symptoms. After blood cultures were obtained, he was given one dose of a first-generation cephalosporin and discharged on a ten-day oral course. He returns because of worsening malaise and neck swelling associated with mild difficulty breathing.\\nThe past medical history is unremarkable. The patient is a postal worker by profession.\\nClinical Findings\\nExamination reveals a 2cm irregularly shaped, indurated non-tender patch on the left anterior neck with mild overly-ing erythema and several 2 to 3 mm vesicles. The main lesion has a 6 mm shallow ulceration. There is massive neck oedema making lymph nodes difficult to assess (see Fig. 21.1). His neck circumference had increased from 57cm at baseline to a peak of 81 cm. Temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse 118 bpm, blood pressure 138/90 mmHg and respiratory rate 20 breath cycles per minute. The remainder of the initial physical examination is normal.\\n• Fig. 21.1 Papulovesicular lesion with extensive neck oedema 2 days after the onset of a small papule.\\nInvestigations\\nFull blood count, Na+, K+, Cl¯ HCO3, BUN, creatinine and random glucose are normal except for a mildly elevated hae-moglobin at 18.7g/dL (reference range: 13.0–18.0g/dL).\\nQuestions\\n1. What are the distinguishing features of this lesion that help narrow down your differential diagnosis?\\n2. What investigations need to be performed to establish early diagnosis and appropriate treatment?\\nDiscussion\\nA 35-year-old male postal worker presents to a clinic in the United States with a papulovesicular lesion on his neck asso-ciated with massive neck swelling. There is no fever but dia-phoresis is present. The patient's condition is worsening despite antibiotic therapy with an oral cephalosporin.\\n55\\n56 CHAPTER 21 A 35-Year-Old American Man With Fatigue and a Neck Lesion\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Are the Distinguishing Features of This Lesion that Help Narrow Down Your Differential Diagnosis?\\nThe differential diagnosis of an ulcerative skin lesion with concomitant massive soft tissue swelling and systemic symp-toms depends on the epidemiological setting and the individ-ual exposure; it includes bacterial ecthyma (Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus), rickettsial diseases, necrotic arachnidism (bite by brown recluse spider), rat-bite fevers Streptococcus moniliformis and (Spirillum minus), ulcero-glandular tularaemia and bubonic plague.\\nAt the time of the patient's presentation, the United States was in the process of investigating a possible event of bioter-rorism. Therefore the most important, though overall rare, diagnosis to consider was cutaneous anthrax.\\nThere may be few distinguishing features at the time of presentation, depending on the age of the lesion. Although it is commonly known that cutaneous anthrax is manifested by a central black eschar, this is not seen until approximately a week after inoculation. The anthrax lesion begins as a pain-less papule that lasts 1 to 2 days before becoming a vesicle that later ruptures. It then develops the classic necrotic cen-tral ulcer and may be surrounded by smaller peripheral ves-icles. Therefore a patient may present with a non-specific localized papulovesicular eruption. Key associated findings include a preceding history of a break in the skin at the affected site, the presence of systemic symptoms such as mal-aise and headache and extensive, non-tender oedema. Fever and leukocytosis may not be present. In parts of the world where anthrax is endemic, zoonotic exposure to infected ani-mals or contaminated animal products is important to estab-lish, whereas exposure from a bioterrorism act may not be immediately apparent.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat Investigations Need to be Performed to Establish Early Diagnosis and Appropriate Treatment?\\nAspirate of fluid from the skin lesion should be sent for Gram stain, culture and susceptibilities along with blood cultures in patients with systemic symptoms regardless of fever status. In the absence of preceding antimicrobial therapy, numerous Gram-positive rods in high concentration will grow within 24 hours. Empirical antibacterial treatment with a quinolone or doxycycline should be instituted while awaiting microbi-ological results. Because negative cultures do not exclude anthrax, full-thickness punch biopsy from the vesicle and the eschar should be obtained, fixed in 10% buffered forma-lin and sent to a specialized laboratory for nucleic acid ampli-fication and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining to detect Bacillus anthracis antigens. Serum should also be tested for antibodies to the protective antigen at baseline and 4 weeks later.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nBlood cultures taken at the first clinic visit grew gram-positive rods. Gram stain and culture of the skin lesion obtained at the second visit were negative for B. anthracis. The patient was admitted and received intravenous levoflox-acin and ampicillin-sulbactam and recovered. Stains for bacteria and IHC of the skin biopsy performed at a reference laboratory showed abundant bacilli in the dermis and the presence of B. anthracis antigens, respectively. Serology revealed that antibody to protective antigen was present in convalescent serum.\\nThe patient was exposed during his occupation as a postal worker, handling contaminated mail. Overall, 22 cases were identified, of which 11 presented with cutaneous anthrax, and a further 11 fell ill with the inhalational form. Five peo-ple died; all deaths occurred secondary to inhalational anthrax.\",\n",
       " 'A 32-year-old, previously fit woman of African descent born in Europe, travelled to rural Jos in Nigeria to visit relatives. According to her husband, 18 days after her return to Europe she developed a fever, and 3 days later became very unwell with abnormal behaviour. On examination she has a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), is mildly jaundiced and confused; her Glasgow Coma Scale is 14/15. She has no rash or palpable lymph nodes, and throat and sclerae are not injected. She has some fine crepitations at the lung bases. The laboratory refuses to undertake tests because of recent rural exposure in an area known to have viral haemorrhagic fever (Lassa). The differential diagnosis is wide, but by some distance the most common cause of fever and jaundice or fever and con- fusion in West Africa is severe falciparum malaria. The fact that the patient had a low-grade fever at presentation is not a reason to exclude malaria, because the temperature swings in malaria and a significant proportion of cases are apyrexial at presentation. A common misdiagnosis is acute viral hepatitis; there, fever precedes the jaundice, and this rapid fulminant course would not be typical. Other causes of acute fever and jaundice include typhoid fever, leptospirosis and ascending cholangitis. Patients with advanced HIV disease and Gram-negative sepsis can also present like this. People returning from visiting friends and relatives constitute a large proportion of imported malaria and are at high risk of not taking antimalarial prophylaxis. A woman born in Europe would be unlikely to have any immunity to malaria. The laboratory is right to raise VHF as a possible diagnosis, but VHF is very rare and 18 days (or more) since leaving the high-risk area is on the outer limit of the incubation period of Lassa fever and other VHF (generally up to 21 days). The absence of injected sclerae or rash is also against the diagnosis. A malaria blood film would be mandatory in this case. If it is positive, the woman could be treated as malaria and other tests taken with standard universal precautions.',\n",
       " 'A 31-year-old HIV-positive man presents to the Emergency Department of a London hospital. He has a 6-week history of increasing shortness of breath on exertion, dry cough, and drenching night sweats. He also reports general fatigue and a weight loss of about 10kg over the past 5 months. He travels extensively for business and in the past 6 months has had work trips to Europe, China, Korea, Japan, Singapore and the United States. He lives with his male partner, denies any recreational drug use and has never smoked tobacco. He was diagnosed with HIV 6 years ago. He says that 1 month ago his CD4 was 280/μL. He is not yet on antiretroviral therapy (ART), nor on co-trimoxazole prophylaxis or any other regular medications. There is no other significant past medical history. He is alert, short of breath at rest but able to complete full sentences. Temperature 39.2°C (102.6°F), blood pressure 120/70 mmHg, pulse 100bpm, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, sO2 87% on air, and 97% on 15L O2. Chest is clear on auscultation. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. His arterial blood gases on air are shown in Table 23.1. His FBC is normal. CRP is 6.7 mg/dL (<5). Creatinine, urea, bilirubin, ALT, AP and albumin are normal. CD4 150/µL, HIV viral load 1 500000 copies/mL (fully sensitive on resistance testing). His chest radiograph is shown in Figure 23.1. The patient was treated with high-flow oxygen and started on high-dose co-trimoxazole plus prednisolone combined with a proton-pump inhibitor. His tachycardia settled with reversal of his hypoxia and he remained otherwise stable. In view of his multiple recent long-haul flights a computed tomography (CT)-pulmonary angiogram was performed to rule out pulmonary embolism (Fig. 23.2). This showed extensive \"ground-glass” infiltrates in both lungs, especially in the lower lobes, but no evidence of pulmonary emboli or cavitations. Serum β-glucan was >500 pg/mL (<80pg/mL). Bronchoscopy was macroscopically normal. Grocott staining of BAL fluid revealed Pneumocystis jirovecii cystic forms, and PCR was strongly positive for P. jirovecii DNA. Oxygen was gradually weaned and the patient was discharged on oral co-trimoxazole to complete a 21-day total course. Ten days into PCP treatment, the patient commenced antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir, emtricitabine and efavirenz. Two weeks into PCP treatment, he developed a widespread pruritic maculopapular rash most likely attributable to either co-trimoxazole or efavirenz. As a result, co-trimoxazole was changed to clindamycin and primaquine for the final week of treatment and efavirenz was replaced by a boosted protease inhibitor. After completing PCP treatment, he was started on dapsone and pyrimethamine for secondary prophylaxis.',\n",
       " \"A 14-Year-Old Boy from Rural Tanzania With Difficulty in Walking\\nWILLIAM P. HOWLETT\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 14-year-old boy presents to his local hospital in rural Tanzania with a history of difficulty in walking. He had been well until just over 2 years earlier when his illness suddenly started. He describes that he was walking home from school when he first noticed that his legs began to feel heavy and started to tremble, which caused him difficulty in walking, with a tendency to fall over. He slowly completed the journey home; and since that day, he has been unable to stand or walk unaided. He now stands on his toes and drags his legs around with the aid of a stick (Fig. 24.1). He denies any history of fever, pain, sensory, bladder or bowel symptoms or disease progression.\\nHis history is otherwise unremarkable. He lives in a village in northern Tanzania in a rural area with limited agricultural suitability, where the main staple food crop is cassava. His diet for the 2 months before the illness was almost exclusively cassava. He has three other siblings, one of whom is similarly affected, whereas their parents remained fine. He mentions that identical cases had occurred in his own and neighbouring villages at around the same time.\\nClinical Examination\\nClinically, he is well nourished with normal vital signs. General examination is unremarkable. On neurological examination, he is fully orientated and higher mental function appears normal. Cranial nerves are normal but bilateral optic pallor was noted on fundoscopy. Limbs reveal signs of spastic paraparesis with flexion contractures at both ankles and knees. Power in the legs is graded 3 to 4 out of 5 (= just overcoming gravity), with the knee extensors and foot dorsiflexors involved to the greatest extent (Fig. 24.1). There is bilateral hypertonia, hyperreflexia and sustained ankle clonus with extensor plantar responses. The arms are normal apart from generalized hyperreflexia. There is no impairment or loss of sensation. A lumbar lordosis with thoracic kyphoscoliosis is noticeable only on standing.\\nInvestigations\\nFull blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood glucose and creatinine are normal. Urine analysis is normal. Microscopy of urine and stool specimens does not show any ova of Schistosoma species. HIV serology and VDRL are negative. Lumbar puncture is normal. Radiographs of the chest and thoracolumbar spine are normal.\\nQuestions\\n1. What is the clinical diagnosis and the likely cause in this patient?\\nDiscussion\\nA 14-year-old boy from rural northern Tanzania presents with acute-onset non-progressive spastic paraplegia. There is no history of back pain. On examination, there is no sensory impairment and no bladder dysfunction. The main staple food crop in his village is cassava.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat is the Clinical Diagnosis?\\nThe clinical syndrome is spastic paraparesis. The main differential diagnosis in Africa includes spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease), transverse myelitis, spinal cord infections such as schistosomiasis and tuberculous myelitis, spinal malignancy (mainly metastases) and tropical nutritional myeloneuropathies.\\nThere are three important features in our case: (1) the isolated involvement of motor neurons without any sensory and bladder involvement; (2) the absence of back pain; and (3) the acute onset with no progression over 2 years. These three clinical points make spinal tuberculosis, spinal cord infection or spinal malignancy very unlikely. Of note, his diet (and probably that of his siblings and other children in the village) for the 2 months before the illness was almost exclusively cassava, and the same disease has affected one of his siblings and more children in the neighborhood. Hence, a nutritional cause must be suspected.\\nThe tropical myeloneuropathies that are nutritional in origin are konzo and lathyrism. Lathyrism in Africa occurs exclusively in Ethiopia.\",\n",
       " \"A 72-Year-Old Male Farmer from Laos With Extensive Skin Lesions on the Lower Leg\\nGÜNTHER SLESAK, SAYTHONG INTHALAD AND PAUL N. NEWTON\\n\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 72-year-old male farmer is admitted to a provincial hospital in northern Laos with extensive, painful verrucous skin lesions on his left foot and lower leg.\\nTen years prior, he had a leech bite on the dorsum of his left foot. One week later a small painless red nodule developed at the site of the bite. Over the following years the lesion slowly increased in size; further lesions developed and spread up to his knee. Three days before admission his ankle became painful and swollen.\\n\\nClinical Findings\\nVital signs are normal and the patient is afebrile. His left lower leg and foot are grossly swollen (Fig. 25.1); the skin is hyperaemic and feels hot. There are several cauliflower-like masses and oval plaque-like lesions on his left lower leg and foot. The lesions are partly erythematous, partly fungating and purulent, oozing a bad odour.\\n\\nInvestigations\\nRadiography of the left leg and foot showed no bone involvement.\\n\\nQuestions\\n1. What are the important differential diagnoses?\\n2. Which diagnostic tests should be done?\\n\\nDiscussion\\nA male Lao farmer presents with several verrucous, partially fungating skin lesions on his left leg and foot, which have been growing over the past 10 years after a minor trauma. The affected leg has additionally swollen up and become painful over the previous 3 days.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Are the Important Differential Diagnoses?\\nChronic verrucous skin lesions can typically be seen in fungal infections such as sporotrichosis (Sporothrix schenckii) and chromoblastomycosis, which is caused by various pigmented fungi. Mycetoma ('Madura Foot') is a chronic subcutaneous infection caused either by fungi ('eumycetoma') or actinomycetes ('actinomycetoma'). Exudating lesions discharging granules are the hallmark feature of madura foot but verrucous manifestations may occur. The colour of the granules may indicate the causing pathogen. Despite being common in other parts of Asia, Mycetoma has rarely been described from Laos.\\nMycobaterial infections (cutaneous tuberculosis, lepromatous leprosy and infections with atypical mycobacteria) also need to be considered. Cutaneous leishmaniasis can present with verrucous lesions, however it has not been reported in Laos. In HIV-positive patients, Kaposi's Sarcoma may look very similar.\\nNon-infectious causes such as squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoidosis, chronic eczema and psoriasis should be borne in mind.\\nAcute localized inflammatory signs are indicative of bacterial superinfection or deep vein thrombosis.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhich Diagnostic Tests Should be Done?\\nDirect microscopy of skin scrapings taken from the lesions can help detect pigmented fungi in chromoblastomycosis and may be useful to visualize amastigotes in cutaneous leishmaniasis.\\nSporotrichosis differs from the other subcutaneous mycoses in that culture is the most reliable mode of diagnosis because there are few organisms present in lesions and these may be difficult to find.\\nIn leprosy, slit skin smears are fairly easy to obtain; however, for other mycobacterial infections biopsy and/or culture may be necessary.\\n\\nThe Case Continued...\\nSecondary bacterial superinfection was suspected and so iodine-based antiseptics were applied locally and oral antibiotics were started initially (cloxacillin and metronidazole). After bacterial culture of the pus grew Enterococcus faecalis, antibiotics were changed to co-trimoxazole, guided by susceptibility testing.\",\n",

The creatinine is increased\\ntwofold and there is thrombocytopenia. The leucocyte count\\nis normal.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat is the Most Likely Diagnosis and What Are\\nYour Differentials?\\nAn acute febrile illness accompanied by jaundice, renal fail-\\nure and subconjunctival haemorrhage should raise the suspi-\\ncion of leptospirosis, particularly in case of a history\\ninvolving exposure to potentially contaminated water.\\nScrub typhus is another very common infection in South\\nAsia. It may present with an acute onset of fever, hepatomeg-\\naly and renal failure. There usually is lymphadenopathy;\\nand on careful examination, one may spot an eschar.\\nSubconjunctival haemorrhage has been described but is less\\ncommon than in leptospirosis, and complications such as\\nrenal failure tend to occur late in the infection (after about\\n7 days).\\nHantavirus infection may cause a haemorrhagic fever with\\nrenal syndrome. It has a similar epidemiology to leptospirosis\\nand is also associated with contact with rodent excreta.\\nDengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is another differential\\ndiagnosis to consider. It also presents with fever, severe myal-\\ngias, thrombocytopenia and haemorrhages. Acute kidney\\ninjury and jaundice are uncommon for DHF.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat Tests Are Indicated to Confirm the\\nDiagnosis?\\nThe microscopic diagnosis of leptospirosis requires a dark-\\nfield or a phase-contrast microscope because the bacteria\\nstain poorly. However, dark-field microscopy is of poor sen-\\nsitivity and specificity and only yields positive results during\\nthe early bacteraemic phase of the disease.\\nLeptospira may be cultured from blood, CSF or urine. Iso-\\nlation of the bacteria from blood or CSF is only possible dur-\\ning the first week of illness. Samples have to be incubated for\\nat least 8 weeks and analysed weekly with a dark-field micro-\\nscope. This technique is laborious and not routine practice in\\na standard microbiological laboratory.\\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection has been used\\non blood, CSF and urine. PCR performance varies between\\ntypes of samples taken and depends on the time the sample\\nwas taken in relation to duration of illness. Sensitivity and\\nspecificity appear to be higher in urine than in blood and\\nare better in blood samples taken early rather than later dur-\\ning the course of illness.\\nFor indirect diagnosis, the historical reference serological\\ntest is the microscopic agglutination test (MAT).

       " \"Clinical Presentation History A 35-year-old Malawian woman presents to a local hospital because of fever and weakness. The fever started 3 days earlier, but the weakness has progressed over the past several months. There is no cough and no night sweats, but she reports some weight loss. There is no diarrhoea, no dysuria and no history of abnormal bleeds. Two months earlier she presented to a local health centre because of her weakness. She was found to be clinically pale and was prescribed iron tablets, which she took. Nevertheless, the weakness progressed. Otherwise, the patient does not report any abnormalities. She is divorced, with three children (17, 15 and 12 years old), who are all well. She works as a small-scale farmer and sells vegetables on the local market. The family can afford three meals a day and occasionally meat or fish. Clinical Findings A 35-year-old woman, wasted, body mass index 17kg/m². Blood pressure 90/60 mmHg (difficult to measure because of the low upper arm circumference), pulse 110bpm, temperature 37.8°C (100°F), respiratory rate 25 breath cycles per minute, oxygen saturation 97% on ambient air, Glasgow Coma Scale 15/15. Her conjunctivae are very pale, but there is no jaundice. The examination of her mouth is normal, there is no oral thrush, no Kaposi's sarcoma lesions and no oral hairy leukoplakia. The chest is clear. The abdomen is soft, with slight diffuse tenderness, but no guarding. The spleen is palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. The rectal examination is normal. Investigations The malaria rapid diagnostic test is negative. The HIV serology comes back positive.

Questions 1. What is the suspected diagnosis? 2. How would you manage this patient? Discussion A 35-year-old Malawian woman presents in a state of sepsis without any clear focal symptoms. She is wasted and severely anaemic and she newly tests HIV-positive. This is a very common clinical scenario in a high-prevalence setting for HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Answer to Question 1 What is the Suspected Diagnosis? The patient presents with a septic picture without a clear focus; she is newly diagnosed HIV-positive and her wasting and anaemia suggest advanced immunosuppression and/or possible concomitant tuberculosis (TB). The most common cause of sepsis in HIV-positive adults in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa is infection with invasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS). The slight abdominal tenderness and her splenomegaly would also fit with this diagnosis. Enteric fevers (typhoid or paratyphoid) are clinically indistinguishable from infection with iNTS, they are however far less common than iNTS in HIV-positive patients in sub-Saharan Africa. The reason for this is unclear. Severe anaemia led to the non-specific feeling of progressive 'weakness' in this patient. It is most likely a consequence of infection of her bone marrow with HIV, Salmonellae and possibly also with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other causes of severe anaemia, such as iron deficiency, helminth infections and malaria, are less common in an HIV-positive urban adult population but may have to be considered in other patients, in particular children, pregnant women or in the rural poor. Thalassaemia usually leads to a microcytic anaemia. Severe anaemia is very common in sub-Saharan Africa. Patients commonly present to healthcare facilities late, at times only when they are developing heart failure secondary to severe anaemia. Visceral leishmaniasis may also cause fever and pancytopenia as seen in this patient. It usually causes gross hepatosplenomegaly which our patient does not have. It also appears not to be endemic in Malawi, but should be considered in other parts of Africa, e.g. South Sudan, Northern Uganda and Northern Kenya, Ethiopia or Somalia. Answer to Question 2 How Would You Manage This Patient? Fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics need to be started immediately. Before starting antibiotic treatment, blood cultures should be taken. Because bacteraemia may be low, it is important to inoculate a decent volume of blood (at least 20-40ml) for culture. Severe anaemia in an HIV-infected person commonly is a sign of TB. Therefore the patient should be assessed for underlying tuberculosis. A chest radiograph and an abdominal ultrasound scan should be done. If the CD4-count is <100 cells/µl, a lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) may also help confirm TB. Of note, anaemia may be the only finding in a patient with TB hiding in the bone marrow; and even if all routine investigations are unremarkable, TB should still be high on the list of possible diagnoses if the patient does not make a satisfactory recovery, i.e. remains febrile and/or anaemic or continues to lose weight. The baseline CD4 count should be checked and the patient should be started on co-trimoxazole preventive treatment as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia, toxoplasmosis and other opportunistic infections. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be started as soon as possible, once the acute infection is under control and concomitant opportunistic infections have been ruled out. The latter is important to prevent unmasking immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Her children and her current and past sexual partners should be encouraged to go for an HIV test.\",\n",

She has been unwell for at least 1 week. She complained of a headache of insidious onset and has been confused for 2 days. One day before presentation the relatives ('guardians') noticed an eyelid drooping on the left side.\\nThe guardians say her past medical history is unremarkable. The patient lives in an urban high-density area. She works as a businesswoman, selling vegetables. She has three healthy children, but another four of her children have died as toddlers. Her husband died a year ago of 'high fever.'\\n\\nClinical Findings\\nOn examination she looks seriously unwell. Glasgow Coma Scale 14/15, temperature 38.4°C (101.1°F), blood pressure 115/75 mmHg, heart rate 86bpm, respiratory rate 18 breath cycles per minute. There is no neck stiffness. The chest is clear. Figure 3.1 shows the examination of her eyes. The remainder of her neurological examination is normal.\\n\\nLaboratory Results\\nHer blood results are shown in Table 3.1. A lumbar puncture is done.

Infectious encephalitis should also be considered; however, the cranial nerve involvement makes this diagnosis less likely. Moreover, the main causes of infectious encephalitis are viral or - less commonly – protozoan (e.g. cerebral toxoplasmosis, human African trypanosomiasis), and the CSF findings of very high protein and very low glucose are not consistent with a viral or protozoan CNS infection. Cerebral malaria has to be considered in any patient with fever and impaired consciousness living in a malarious area. However, cerebral malaria would be an uncommonly severe manifestation in a most probably semi-immune adult residing in a holoendemic area. In addition, cranial nerve palsies are an unusual feature of cerebral malaria.\\nThe differential diagnosis comprises bacterial, tuberculous and cryptococcal meningitis (Table 3.3). Neither the patient's clinical presentation nor her CSF results can help differentiate reliably between the three. Furthermore, onset, acuteness and duration of symptoms and signs may have to be interpreted with caution in many cultures, particularly when the history cannot be taken from the patients themselves.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow Would You Manage This Patient?\\nThe patient has a suspected CNS infection and is seriously ill with confusion, cranial nerve palsy and a high fever. Immediate action should be taken, and treatment should not be delayed whilst further test results are being awaited. Pragmatic treatment should cover bacterial, cryptococcal and tuberculous meningitis.\\nGram-stain and bacterial culture should be done from the CSF. If available, an ultrasensitive PCR for M. tuberculosis (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra) should be ordered. The sensitivity of Ziehl-Neelsen stain from the CSF is low in many settings. Cryptococcal antigen (CrAG) testing should be done from CSF and serum; additionally, India ink stain and fungal culture should be done for detection of Cryptococcus neoformans.\\nAn HIV-serology study is crucial because cryptococcal meningitis is associated with immunosuppression. Tuberculous meningitis is also more common in HIV-positive than in uninfected persons.\\n\\nThe Case Continued. . .\\nThe patient was started on ceftriaxone 2g bid, fluconazole 1200 mg od (local protocol for cryptococcal meningitis in the absence of amphotericin B and flucytosin) and on treatment for presumptive TB-meningitis.\\n\\nTABLE 3.3 Clinical and CSF Features of Acute Bacterial, Tuberculous and Cryptococcal Meningitis\\nBacterial Pathogen Clinical Features CSF Features\\nAcute Bacterial Meningitis Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus suis (Asia) Often very rapid onset with high fever and meningism, cranial nerve involvement less common Often cloudy, high leukocyte cell count, predominance of polymorphs, low glucose\\nTuberculous Meningitis Mycobacterium tuberculosis Often a history of several days of illness, onset less abrupt, cranial nerve involvement common Often clear, high CSF protein, low CSF glucose\\nCryptococcal Meningitis Cryptococcus neoformans Often subacute onset, severe headache common, cranial nerve involvement common CSF can be normal in at least 25% of cases\\n\\n• Fig. 3.2 Ziehl-Neelsen stain of CSF sample showing acid-fast bacilli (arrows).

       " \"A 12-year-old boy is brought to a health centre in rural north-west Kenya. He reports 2 months of painful, watery, red eyes. The watering of his eyes is worse in the sun and he is struggling to keep his eyes open. Six months previously he was treated at a dispensary for less severe symptoms. He was given tetracycline eye ointment but his symptoms did not improve. After this, he went to a traditional healer who applied some juice extracts from the ecucuka plant (Aloe vera species). After instillation he experienced severe eye pain and discharge, both eyes became very red and he could hardly see. The boy lives with his parents in Loima, Turkana County, a hot, dusty and dry area of Kenya. They fetch water from a dried riverbed about 6 kilometres from home. They keep herds of cows and sheep, and the boy helps with herding and watering. A 12-year-old boy who appears systemically well. Very poor vision in both eyes: His visual acuity is 6/60 with the left eye, but he can only perceive hand movements with the right eye.

What are your differential diagnoses? What features fit the criteria for trachoma? A 12-year-old Kenyan boy from a pastoralist community in an arid area presents with painful, red eyes, discharge and poor vision. He has a history of using traditional eye medicine. On examination he has lid, conjunctival and corneal scarring associated with severe follicular inflammation and trichiasis (in-turning lashes). One eye has a perforated corneal ulcer with scarred iris adhesion (leucoma). What Are Your Differential Diagnoses? The most important diagnoses to consider are: 1. Corneal and conjunctival damage from use of traditional eye medicine. 2. Trachomatous trichiasis. 3. Vitamin A deficiency. Further useful information includes dietary intake, history of measles predisposing to vitamin A deficiency and ideally blood retinol (vitamin A) levels (this only drops once hepatic stores of vitamin A are severely depleted). What Features Fit the Criteria for Trachoma? For the diagnosis of trachoma, two out of five clinical criteria need to be fulfilled. This boy has all five criteria: 1. Follicles on the tarsal (inner) conjunctiva. These are 0.5 to 2 mm pale, raised inflammatory foci with hyperaemic surround. Multiple follicles give a rough or dimpled appearance to the surface of the conjunctiva. 2. Conjunctival scarring of the upper tarsal conjunctiva. White bands or strands evident on everting (flipping) the upper eyelid which can also sometimes be seen on the inner lower lid. 3. Limbal follicles or Herbert's pits. Follicles can occur at the edge of the cornea (limbus), and they leave 0.5 to 2 mm dark circular lesions (Herbert's pits). 4. Fibrovascular pannus, mostly affecting the upper cornea. Ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue from the limbus ruining the transparency of the cornea. 5. Trichiasis on the upper lid. In-turning of the lashes so they scuff the cornea.\",\n",

What is your suspected diagnosis? 2. How would you approach this patient? Discussion CHAPTER 33 A 53-Year-Old Man from Malawi With a Chronic Cough 91 A 53-year-old Malawian man presents with chronic cough and constitutional symptoms. A course of oral antibiotics did not yield any improvement. The patient is not aware of any TB contacts. On admission he is newly diagnosed with HIV-infection and advanced immunosuppression. His sputum microscopy is negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Chest radiography shows a prominent hilar region but is otherwise normal. Answer to Question 1 What is Your Suspected Diagnosis? In all HIV-positive patients with cough and weight loss who do not respond to antibiotic therapy, tuberculosis is top of the list of differential diagnoses. In this case the most likely diagnosis is smear-negative pulmonary TB. TB in patients with advanced immunosuppression often presents with a clinical picture that is very different from immunocompetent individuals: sputum smear-negative TB, which is uncommon in HIV-negative patients, is com- monly seen in HIV-infected patients, particularly if immu- nosuppression is advanced as in this case. The slightly prominent hilar region seen on the patient's chest radiograph is compatible with the intrathoracic lymphadenopathy: typ- ical though not specific for TB. Physical examination of the chest is normal in about half of HIV patients with pulmonary TB. The fact that the patient does not report any TB contact should not be overvalued. Firstly, TB in immunosuppression is often a consequence of reactivation and the primary infec- tion may have been decades ago. Secondly, in resource-limited countries, practically everyone is exposed to TB – this could occur during a ride on an overcrowded minibus or when con- gregating with friends and family in someone's small home. Given the fact that our patient is in an advanced stage of immunosuppression and has not taken any co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, an alternative or possibly co-existing diagnosis to consider is Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). A concomitant bacterial chest infection is possible but unlikely to explain the whole 3 months of illness. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) of the lung is another differential diagnosis to consider, but patients with pulmonary KS usu- ally have manifestations of KS elsewhere (skin, oral mucosa). On chest radiography of patients with pulmonary KS, patchy infiltrations are commonly seen in the lower lung zones. Nei- ther was the case in our patient, which makes this diagnosis unlikely. Pulmonary malignancy or pulmonary sarcoidosis, which would be high on the list of differential diagnoses in indus- trialized countries, are much less likely than an infectious cause in the given setting. Apart from chest infections, Gram-negative sepsis second- ary to invasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) needs to be considered in this febrile and anaemic patient with advanced immunosuppression. Answer to Question 2 How Would You Approach This Patient? Induced sputum should be examined for acid-fast bacilli. Real-time PCR-based tests such as XPert MTB/RIF are easy to use, more sensitive than microscopy and also help detect rifampicin resistance. Thanks to an endorsement by WHO and international donor support, XPert MTB/ RIF is increasingly available even at remote hospitals in rural areas. Mycobacterial cultures of the sputum should be done but results will take several weeks, too long to guide the clini- cian's imminent decision. Ideally, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage should be done and material assessed for M. tuberculosis (PCR, cul- ture, microscopy) and Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCR, micros- copy). Pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma could also be diagnosed on endoscopy. Urine lipoarabinomannan (urine-LAM) is a simple lateral-flow assay helpful to look for TB in patients with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 <100/µl). A positive test indicates disseminated TB with renal involvement. Ultrasound is also very useful and simple to look for signs of extrapulmonary/disseminated TB in patients with advanced immunosuppression. Simple and very useful algo- rithms have been published to guide clinicians not ultrasound-experienced in the diagnosis of TB. If none of these investigations is available, it is well justi- fiable to empirically start the patient on antituberculous treatment, because sputum smear-negative TB is common and fatal if untreated. Adding prednisolone for the first 4 weeks of antituberculous treatment has been shown to reduce the incidence of immune-reconstitution inflamma- tory syndrome (IRIS). Additional antibiotic treatment should be considered in this febrile patient with advanced immunosuppression. If available, blood cultures should be taken in any febrile patient before starting antibiotic treatment. Also, adding high-dose co-trimoxazole to antituberculous therapy as pre- sumptive treatment for PCP has to be considered if the patient does not clinically improve. The optimal timing to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) is within the first 8 weeks of starting antituberculous treatment and within the first 2 weeks for patients who have CD4 cell counts <50 cells/µl. The Case Continued... Induced sputum results came back negative for AFB and there was no sputum PCR available. The patient's exercise test (walking down the hospital corridor three times at a fast pace) showed oxygen saturation of 98% as opposed to 97% at rest, and was therefore negative. 92 CHAPTER 33 A 53-Year-Old Man from Malawi With a Chronic Cough The patient was treated for a possible bacterial chest infec- tion, covering also for Gram-negative bacteria. He received ceftriaxone 2g IV od and erythromycin 500mg qid for 5 days. It was decided not to treat him for PCP and he received the prophylactic dose of co-trimoxazole (480mg bid according to local national guidelines). Nonetheless, his fever persisted, even though the cough subjectively improved slightly. On day 7 in the hospital, the patient was started on empir- ical treatment for smear-negative TB with four antitubercu- lous drugs (Isoniazid (H), Rifampicin (R), Pyrazinamide (P) and Ethambutol (E). After the first week of treatment, he started to feel better. His fever went down and the cough gradually settled. He was discharged home. Three weeks into the TB treatment he was seen at the HIV clinic. He was doing well and had started antiretroviral therapy.

SUMMARY BOX Tuberculosis in HIV-Infected Patients TB and HIV infection are the most important 'tropical' diseases in adults in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Co-infection with HIV and TB is common and poses a particular challenge to the clinician. Clinical presentation of TB changes with declining peripheral CD4 counts (Table 33.2). • Fig. 33.2 Chest radiograph of a patient with miliary TB. Cavitating smear-positive pulmonary TB, as seen classically in HIV-negative individuals, is uncommon in advanced immuno- suppression. Instead, patients more commonly present with sputum smear-negative pulmonary TB. CXR may be completely normal and clinical symptoms are often discrete; patients may produce little sputum and haemoptysis is rare. HIV-positive individuals are also more likely to present with extrapulmonary TB manifesting as pleural effusion, pericardial disease, lymph node TB, abdominal TB, TB meningitis and miliary disease or a combination of these (Fig. 33.2). Severe anaemia is a common clinical clue to a co-infection with HIV/TB and reflects bone marrow involvement. When treating HIV/TB co-infected patients, pharmacokinetic interactions between rifampicin and antiretroviral drugs have to be considered. Adding prednisolone during the first 4 weeks of antituberculous treatment may help decrease the risk of immune- reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Further Reading 1. Thwaites G.

Ninety-five per\\ncent of CM cases in developing countries are HIV-associated. CM\\nis the most common cause of adult meningitis in sub-Saharan\\nAfrica and parts of Asia where HIV prevalence is high.\\nCryptococcal meningitis is caused by the encapsulated\\nenvironmental yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans. It is an oppor-\\ntunistic infection, which occurs at advanced stages of immuno-\\nsuppression, in HIV mostly at CD4 counts below 100/μL. Patients\\nusually present with a sub-acute headache of several days to\\nweeks duration. Other common clinical findings are cranial nerve\\npalsies (N VI), confusion and impaired consciousness. Altered\\nmental state is associated with increased lethality. CM is clinically\\nindistinguishable from tuberculous meningitis (TBM), although\\nfever and neck stiffness are more common in TBM.\\nCSF opening pressure is often markedly elevated. Further\\nCSF findings are commonly non-specific, and the CSF may even\\nbe normal. Diagnosis of CM is made by demonstrating the fungus\\nin the CSF. This is traditionally done by light microscopy after\\nIndia-Ink staining (Fig. 35.2), but this method is user-dependent\\nand the sensitivity is therefore variable. Detection of CrAg e.g. by\\nlatex-agglutination test or lateral flow assay (LFA) is better. Fungal\\nculture of CSF is required to isolate the organism for antimicrobial\\nsusceptibility testing. CM treatment consists of three phases:\\ninduction, consolidation, and maintenance. The gold standard is\\nan induction therapy with two fungicidal drugs that rapidly\\ndecrease the fungal burden in the CSF i.e. combined (liposomal)\\namphotericin B plus flucytosine (IV or oral) for the initial 2 weeks,\\nfollowed by oral fluconazole 400 mg daily for at least 8 weeks and\\nfluconazole maintenance therapy 200 mg daily until immune\\nreconstitution.\\nThe reality in many resource-limited settings is however\\nhampered by poor drug availability and therefore commonly dif-\\nfers from the gold standard. Oral fluconazole is often the only\\navailable drug, thanks to a drug donation programme by the\\nmanufacturing company. Fluconazole is only fungistatic, which\\nmay be effective as a secondary prophylaxis, but is less useful as\\ninduction therapy when potent fungicidal drugs are needed to\\nrapidly bring down the fungal burden. Studies in low-income\\nsettings have demonstrated that even short courses of Ampho-\\ntericin B (5-7 days) are preferable to treatment with fluconazole\\nalone. Flucytosine, the other fungicidal drug, is expensive; and\\ndespite its great value in the treatment of CM, remains unlicensed\\nin many African and Asian countries. Steroids are of no benefit in\\nthe treatment of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis.\\nMany patients with CM suffer from severe headaches, which\\ndo not respond to analgesics. The headache is caused by raised\\nintracranial pressure (ICP) and therapeutic lumbar punctures\\n(LPs) bring immediate pain relief. LPs may have to be repeated on\\na daily basis until the ICP has come down and sustained pain\\ncontrol has been achieved.\\nHIV-positive patients with CM should start antiretroviral ther-\\napy, but the optimum timing is not yet clear. Introduction of ART\\n4 to 10 weeks after starting antifungal treatment is currently\\nconsidered the safest approach.\\nPrognosis of CM in resource-limited settings is poor and 10-\\nweek lethality on fluconazole monotherapy may exceed 60%.\\nFurther Reading\\n1.

       " 'A 23-year-old farmer from Myanmar presents to a district hospital in Myanmar with a 3-year history of left-sided scrotal swelling. The swelling is non-tender and has gradually increased in size. There is no history of fever. He has attempted to treat the swelling with traditional herbal medicine to no avail. The patient comes from the central part of Myanmar. He reports that scrotal swelling is not an uncommon problem in his home region. The patient is a 23-year-old man in fair general condition. His vital signs are normal and he is afebrile. There is unilateral scrotal swelling, which cannot be reduced (Fig. 36.1). There are no palpable inguinal lymph nodes. The most common differentials to consider in a chronic, non-tender, unilateral scrotal swelling are inguinal hernia and hydrocoele. A testicular tumour also needs to be taken into consideration. Unlike hydrocoeles, hernias can often be manually reduced. Hydrocoeles may be verified by trans-illumination with a penlight. The patient reports that scrotal swelling is common in the region where he comes from. This may suggest a possible infectious aetiology. The most important infectious disease to consider in this patient is lymphatic filariasis (LF) caused by Wuchereria bancrofti. Hydrocoele is the most common clinical abnormality in men with bancroftian filariasis. Also, urogenital schistosomiasis (Schistosoma haematobium) may lead to unilateral scrotal swelling, but it is not endemic in South-east Asia. Testicular tuberculosis is another infectious disease that may manifest with scrotal swelling. However, the long duration of the swelling in the absence of other signs and symptoms make this unlikely, and it would not explain the large number of cases seen in his home region. Ultrasound can help distinguish a testicular tumour from a hydrocoele or hernia. Also, in case of lymphatic filariasis, adult worms may be seen on scrotal ultrasonography (“filarial dance sign”). The traditional diagnostic gold standard for lymphatic filariasis is the proof of microfilariae in the blood. Samples should be collected when microfilaraemia is highest. For the majority of filarial species, this is between 9 PM and 3 AM because of the nocturnal biting activities of most vectors. Microfilarial PCR assays have a sensitivity and specificity comparable to microscopy with an experienced microscopist, but are usually not available in a district hospital setting. Circulating filarial antigen (CFA) tests detect antigens released by adult W. bancrofti. They are available as immunochromatographic card tests and can use finger-prick blood. Because there is no periodicity of adult-worm antigens, CFA tests can be taken at any time. Their sensitivity and specificity are high. CFA tests are also the preferred method for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of bancroftian filariasis within national control programmes. Antifilarial antibody testing lacks specificity and is of limited value. Hydrocoele was confirmed on ultrasound. The patient underwent hydrocoelectomy, and 3 litres of clear fluid could be drained during the operation. He also received antifilarial treatment. He lived in a remote area and was lost to follow-up afterwards.',\n",

       " 'A 30-Year-Old Male Chinese Trader With Fever in Laos. PAUL N. NEWTON, VALY KEOLUANGKHOT, MAYFONG MAYXAY, MICHAEL D. GREEN AND FACUNDO M. FERNÁNDEZ. Clinical Presentation. History. A 30-year-old male Chinese itinerant trader is referred to a hospital in Vientiane, Laos, with 7 days of fever, chills, headache and a dry cough. He developed slide-positive falciparum malaria whilst living in southern Laos and was treated with intravenous infusions and intramuscular artemether 80 mg for 5 days, which he had brought from China as standby therapy, but did not improve. The fever persisted, jaundice developed and he was therefore transferred to the capital Vientiane. Clinical Findings. On admission he was febrile (39.5°C, 103.1°F) with normal blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Score, but had nausea, dry cough, moderate dehydration, chest pain and abdominal tenderness. His chest was clear and no hepatosplenomegaly was detected. Investigations. Giemsa smear was negative for malaria parasites but a rapid diagnostic test (HRP-2) was positive for Plasmodium falciparum, consistent with recent falciparum malaria. Serum creatinine and glucose were normal. His further laboratory results are shown in Table 39.1. Questions. 1. What are your most important differential diagnoses? 2. How would you approach this patient? Discussion. A 30-year-old Chinese itinerant trader presents to a hospital in Laos with persistent fever after receiving a 5-day course of antimalarial treatment with artemether for falciparum malaria. His blood smear is negative, but his rapid diagnostic test is positive for P. falciparum. TABLE 39.1 Laboratory Results on Admission. Parameter (unit) Patient Reference range. ALT (U/L) 301 <40. AST (U/L) 230 <37. ALP (U/L) 470 <120. Total bilirubin (µmol/L) 14 <14.5. Direct bilirubin (µmol/L) 6.4 <4.3. Answer to Question 1. What are your most important differential diagnoses? With falciparum malaria the patient is at risk of bacterial co-infection, especially with Salmonella species. He could have another common infectious disease contracted in Laos such as scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi), murine typhus (Rickettsia typhi), leptospirosis, tuberculosis or dengue fever. Artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria has been described from southern Laos, Cambodia border, the Burma (Myanmar)/Thai border, Myanmar and southern Vietnam, manifested as prolonged parasite clearance times. Other possibilities are that the artemether was given at the incorrect dose, was of poor quality or that there were issues with intestinal absorption of the medicine. Answer to Question 2. How would you approach this patient? Repeat history, physical examination and investigations (such as blood culture and chest radiography) looking for other causes of infection, review of the antimalarial dosage received and likely efficacy and consider retreatment with a known, quality-assured antimalarial. The Case continued... The patient was treated with oral quinine sulphate 10 mg/kg every 8 hours and doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours for 7 days. His fever cleared 35 hours after starting this therapy and he was discharged well. No evidence was found for any other infections.',\n",
       " \"4 A 4-Year-Old Girl from Uganda in a Coma DOUGLAS G. POSTELS Clinical Presentation History It is the rainy season in rural eastern Uganda. A 4-year-old girl, previously healthy, is carried into the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department. Her father reports that she was well until yesterday. She had a bad headache in the early afternoon but later in the evening developed shaking chills. Believing this was yet another episode of malaria, a common problem in their village, the family planned to take her to the health centre in the morning. The child slept restlessly. At 5 a.m. today the family woke to find the girl was in the midst of a seizure, which lasted about ten minutes. It has taken 4 hours for the family to reach A&E and the little girl has not awoken. The child has not had any recent head trauma and the family knows of no other reason that the child might be ill. Clinical Findings Her temperature is 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse 150 bpm, respiratory rate 36 breath cycles per minute and blood pressure 98/40 mmHg. She has no neck stiffness or jaundice. Capillary refill is normal. There is nasal flaring with respirations. Blantyre Coma Scale is 1/5. Pupils are 2 mm and reactive, and extraocular movements are normal by oculocephalic manoeuvres. She has no papilloedema on direct ophthalmoscopy. With stimulation there is decerebrate posturing that resolves spontaneously. On cardiac examination she has a gallop rhythm. Her liver is palpable 2cm below the right costal margin and her spleen is 4cm below the left costal margin. A rapid test for glucose is normal. Laboratory Results Laboratory results are given in Table 4.1. Questions 1. What is the differential diagnosis? 2. What additional work-up should be performed? TABLE 4.1 Laboratory Results on Admission Parameter Patient Reference Range Haematocrit (%) 17.6 ≥30 Platelet count ×109/L) 28 150-450 Malaria RDT Positive Negative Discussion A 4-year-old Ugandan girl is brought to the hospital unconscious with no neurological localizing signs, a supple neck, hepatosplenomegaly and a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test. Early laboratory testing reveals anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Answer to Question 1 What Is the Differential Diagnosis? The most important underlying aetiologies of coma to consider are cerebral malaria, acute bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis and intoxication (particularly organophosphates). Metabolic abnormalities (hypoglycaemia, or renal or hepatic failure) and non-convulsive status epilepticus may be primary causes of coma or complicate these infectious and toxic aetiologies. Although there is no neck stiffness, she is deeply comatose, making this clinical finding less reliable; the absence of neck stiffness should not lower the clinician's suspicion of meningitis. Rapid testing shows that hypoglycaemia is not the cause of the child's abnormal mental status and it has been 4 hours since her last clinical seizure, making a post-ictal state unlikely. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines cerebral malaria as an 'otherwise unexplained coma in a patient with malaria parasitaemia'. This clinical diagnosis is, however, non-specific because of high rates of asymptomatic parasitaemia in those geographical areas where malaria is most common and the abundance of differential diagnoses. People living in an area of high malaria transmission (such as rural Uganda in the rainy season) may be frequently bitten by malaria-infected female anopheline mosquitoes. Initially, this produces clinical illness (either uncomplicated or complicated malaria); but with repeated infectious challenges, a state of asymptomatic parasitaemia may be attained. Therefore in African children in a coma, a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) does not rule out an underlying non-malarial aetiology of acute illness. In parasitaemic African children in a coma, direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy may be useful in differentiating malarial from non-malarial aetiologies of coma (see Summary Box). Answer to Question 2 What Additional Work-Up Should Be Performed? Although the child has a positive malaria RDT, a lumbar puncture should be performed to rule out bacterial meningitis. If available, an electroencephalogram (EEG) may be useful to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus as either a primary coma aetiology or a contributor to illness. More sophisticated laboratory evaluations (creatinine, electrolytes, bilirubin) may be useful but are seldom available in the geographical contexts where malaria is most prevalent. An ophthalmoscopic examination to evaluate for malarial retinopathy may be helpful. The presence of one or more retinal findings (retinal whitening, haemorrhages or orange-white vessels with or without papilloedema) would lend support to a malarial aetiology of acute illness (Fig. 4.1). Children with retinopathy-negative cerebral malaria may be more likely to have a non-malarial aetiology for their coma. As both retinopathy-negative and retinopathy-positive cerebral malaria may be complicated by bacteraemia, bacterial meningitis, seizures and/or metabolic abnormalities, a complete work-up for non-malarial coma aetiologies (including non-convulsive status epilepticus) is indicated in all patients presenting with WHO clinically defined cerebral malaria. The Case Continued... A lumbar puncture was performed. The CSF was clear and acellular; opening pressure was normal. Blood cultures were taken, and mydriatic drops instilled to perform ophthalmoscopy. This revealed white-centred haemorrhages in both eyes. After administration of artesunate 2.4 mg/kg IV in A&E, the child was admitted to the high-dependency section of the hospital's paediatric unit for frequent monitoring of vital signs and serum glucose. Artesunate was repeated at 12 and 24 hours and then once daily. An EEG showed diffuse slowing but no epileptiform activity. Twelve hours after admission the child had one short (1 minute) generalized seizure that spontaneously resolved and did not recur. Forty hours after admission her Blantyre Coma Score was 4/5. The child was discharged home on hospital day five, with a follow-up appointment in the neurology clinic scheduled after 4 weeks. • Fig. 4.2 Infant with cerebral malaria hospitalized at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi (Courtesy Mr James Peck). • Fig. 4.1 White-centred haemorrhages and retinal whitening, both features of malaria retinopathy (Courtesy Dr Nicholas Beare). SUMMARY BOX Cerebral Malaria and Malarial Retinopathy Cerebral malaria is defined as an otherwise unexplained coma in a patient with Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia. Malaria kills almost 450000 people per year, the vast majority of them children younger than 6 years old living in sub-Saharan Africa. Many of these children have cerebral malaria (Fig. 4.2). In African children with parasitaemia in a coma, direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy may be useful in differentiating malarial from non-malarial aetiologies of coma. In autopsy studies, identification of malarial retinopathy during life was 95% sensitive and 100% specific for the post-mortem identification of sequestered parasitized erythrocytes in cerebral vasculature. Sequestered parasitized erythrocytes in the CNS are a pathological hallmark of cerebral malaria and likely indicate that acute malarial infection was responsible for the patient's illness and death. In these autopsy studies, children who fulfilled WHO clinical criteria for cerebral malaria but lacked malarial retinopathy (i.e. they had retinopathy-negative cerebral malaria) had other non-malarial aetiologies of death on autopsy, including systemic infections (pneumonia) and Reye syndrome. In contrast, an epidemiological modelling study in children with retinopathy-negative cerebral malaria showed that the attributable fraction of disease as a result of malaria infection itself is at least 85%. The proportion of children with retinopathy-negative (cerebral) malaria who have non-malarial etiologies of coma remains unknown. The mainstay of therapy is antimalarials, intensive supportive care and diagnosis and treatment of non-malarial infectious and non-infectious contributors to illness. Even in specialized centres, the case fatality rate for cerebral malaria is 15% to 25%. One-third of survivors are left with neurological sequelae, including epilepsy, cognitive impairment, attention problems and behavioural disorders. Further Reading 1. White NJ. Malaria.

       " \"A 62-Year-Old Woman from Ethiopia With Difficulty Eating\\nCHRISTOPHER J.M. WHITTY\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 62-year-old woman from rural Ethiopia had flown to Europe to visit her daughter and meet her new grandchild. She was normally fit and well and very physically active, because she worked on her smallholding in Ethiopia. Three days after arrival she began to find it difficult to chew, with what she described through her daughter as 'stiffness of the mouth'. This had never happened before.\\nClinical Findings\\nNo abnormal findings are discovered on examination. Her pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate are within normal limits.\\nQuestions\\n1. What are the important differential diagnoses and what would help establish the diagnosis?\\n2. What is the immediate management?\\nDiscussion\\nA 62-year-old woman from Ethiopia presents with difficulties chewing. She has been fit and well in the past. Her physical examination is unremarkable.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Are the Important Differential Diagnoses and What Would Help Establish the Diagnosis?\\nAlthough there is a range of possible causes of stiffness on mastication, the main cause from less developed countries is early tetanus. The risk factors are agricultural work and being from a country and age group in which vaccination is unlikely to have occurred. An important differential for trismus in older people is giant cell arteritis (GCA), and an ESR should be performed on this woman to exclude GCA as a matter of urgency, although she is towards the lower end of the age range for this.\\nThe diagnosis of tetanus is purely clinical. Generalized tetanus with spasms is easy to diagnose once it is established, but it is usually preceded by trismus because the muscles of mastication have the shortest motor neurons.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat is the Immediate Management?\\nThe initial treatment for any possible tetanus is to give an antibiotic (metronidazole is the antibiotic of choice) to kill the infection and prevent more toxin production, and an antitoxin injection to neutralize circulating tetanospasmin. The earlier this is undertaken the better the outlook; therefore it is better to over-suspect tetanus than to wait until spasms make the diagnosis obvious.\\nThe time between the high-risk injury and the first symptoms is a guide to prognosis but often it is not known, especially in agricultural populations who may sustain high-risk injuries (which may be minor) regularly.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe woman received metronidazole and antitoxin on day 1. On day 2 she presented again, having had two generalized spasms. Over the next 2 days she was nursed in a dark, quiet environment, but her spasms increased in frequency, severity and duration over the next 5 days and she developed dysphagia. She was treated with diazepam and antitoxin was administered intrathecally. A prophylactic tracheotomy was performed because of the risk of laryngeal spasms, the commonest cause of sudden death in tetanus. Her symptoms got no worse after 7 days; she did not have to be paralysed and ventilated, and her respiration was not severely compromised at any point. She made a slow recovery over 3 weeks, and was still experiencing stiffness when seen in clinic 3 months later.\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nTetanus\\nSevere tetanus is a terrible disease both to have and to witness. Some tetanus stops at trismus, but most will go on to generalized spasms. As these become more severe, respiratory function is compromised; and in the most severe cases, there is autonomic dysregulation with rapid swings in blood pressure, heart rate and pulse. There is a wide variation in the mortality from established generalized tetanus between different units, demonstrating that proper medical and nursing care have a significant influence on outcome. Wounds require meticulous cleaning and debridement. After the initial antibiotics, antitoxin and diazepam (for spasms), it is essential to assess the stage of the patient regularly. Tetanus toxin already in the motor nerves will not be affected by antitoxin and will continue to track to the spinal cord, therefore patients generally continue to deteriorate for several days after initial presentation and treatment. Intrathecal antitoxin should be considered in severe cases. In survivors, the disease then plateaus before a slow recovery. Most deaths are either from laryngeal spasm (rapid), respiratory arrest in prolonged spasms, cardiac dysrhythmia or chest infection. Increased respiratory rate (over 40 breath cycles per minute) or difficulty swallowing should make the treating physician consider the risk of laryngeal spasm and prepare the patient for either elective tracheotomy or paralysis and ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because of the protracted course of tetanus, weaning from ventilators once started is slow and difficult, with all the complications that a prolonged stay in an ICU brings.\",\n",
       " \"A 7-Year-Old Girl from West Africa With Two Skin Ulcers and a Contracture of Her Right Wrist\\nMORITZ VOGEL\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 7-year-old girl is presented to a district hospital in the trop-ical region of a West African country. After an insect bite, she developed an itchy papule on the back of her right hand, which enlarged over a period of 3 months. A traditional healer had prescribed herbal remedies. When the lesion ulcerated a few weeks later, diclofenac and dexamethasone were administered at the local health post. When a second lesion appeared, treatment with oxacillin was initiated with no effect. The girl became increasingly unable to use her right hand. There is no history of relevant trauma or systemic symptoms.\\nClinical Findings\\nA 7-year-old, anxious girl in good general condition holding her right wrist in a 45° flexion and 20° abduction position. Pulse 108bpm (normal 70–110), blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, temperature 37.9°C (100.2°F).\\nTwo skin ulcers are present on the back of her right hand (3 x 3 cm) and on the medial side of her right wrist (0.5 × 1 cm). The larger ulcer is filled with necrotic tissue (Fig. 41.1) and surrounded by hypo- and hyperpigmenta-tion, lichenification and desquamation. An ill-defined indu-ration surrounds the ulcers (12 × 8cm) with oedema extending from the lower arm to the fingers. A 0.5 × 0.5 cm nodule is noticed above the medial right elbow.\\nQuestions\\n1. What is the most likely diagnosis and what is the differ-ential diagnosis?\\n2. What is the appropriate clinical approach in the given context?\\nDiscussion\\nA 7-year-old West African girl presents with two progressive cutaneous ulcers linked by an area of altered skin. The move-ment in the associated joint is restricted. General symptoms are limited to a mildly elevated temperature.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat is the Most Likely Diagnosis and What is the Differential Diagnosis?\\nThe geographical region of West Africa, the young age of the patient, the location of the lesion on the extremities, the absence of major trauma and the clinical picture lead to a sus-pected diagnosis diagnosis of Buruli ulcer (BU). The history of an insect bite is an incidental finding, the mode of trans-mission of the causative organism, Mycobacterium ulcerans, remains unknown.\\nPain and low-grade fever as seen in this case may also be explained by bacterial superinfection. A careful history and physical examination will provide guidance in differentiating numerous other infectious (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic) and non-infectious (trauma, envenoming, autoimmune, haematological, neoplastic) causes of ulcers in tropical coun-tries. In areas endemic for BU, the accuracy of clinical diag-nosis in experienced hands is remarkably high.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat is the Appropriate Clinical Approach in the Given Context?\\nAdequate wound care, including pain relief, according to WHO guidelines should be instituted immediately. The desired sterile, moist atmosphere of the wound can be achieved with saline-soaked gauze changed daily. Coloniza-tion with other bacteria may be controlled by povidone-iodine. Antitetanus coverage must be secured. Written doc-umentation of pain control and picture documentation of wound progress is helpful in achieving or maintaining a high-quality wound management standard.\\nLaboratory confirmation of BU by M. ulcerans using PCR is desirable but limited by the availability of reliable labora-tory capacity and by its cost, which must be balanced with important supportive measures, such as improved nutrition.\\nThe indication for surgical debridement depends on the clinical picture, but also on the availability of adequate anaes-thetic and surgical care.\\nBU-specific antimycobacterial therapy should be com-menced as soon as possible. In the absence of systemic symp-toms, the toxicity of the recommended antibiotic treatment may justify a few days of delay until diagnostic results have been obtained.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nPCR from a wound swab confirmed the presence of M. ulcer-ans. During the 8 weeks of specific treatment and wound care the ulcer on the back of the hand healed almost completely, but the second smaller ulcer increased to 8 × 10 cm in size (Fig. 41.2).\\nDebridement and skin grafting were performed, and the patient made an uneventful recovery. The restriction of movement was corrected by physiotherapy.\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nMycobacterium ulcerans Disease (Buruli Ulcer)\\nM. ulcerans disease is a necrotizing infection mainly of the sub-cutaneous tissue. It is most prevalent among children and ado-lescents living in rural communities of West Africa; but other continents and temperate regions of Australia, China and Japan are also affected. Endemic areas are associated with water bodies such as rivers and lakes. However, the exact mode of transmission remains poorly understood.\\nM. ulcerans is characterized by its particular sensitivity to heat, its propensity to develop local and distant satellite lesions and its production of a necrotizing, locally immunosuppressive and analgesic macrolide exotoxin called mycolactone.\\nClinically, M. ulcerans disease presents with skin lesions ranging from papules, nodules and plaques to the eponymous ulcers. The latter may involve most of a limb surface or trunk and can simultaneously occur at different body sites. All lesions share skin alterations including induration, hypo- and hyperpigmenta-tion, lichenification, desquamation and possibly local oedema. Ulcers are characterized by undermined edges surrounding a 'cotton wool' like necrosis. Lesions are classically described as painless, but evidence has emerged questioning this doctrine. The diagnosis can be confirmed most reliably by PCR from a wound swab; however, a test for the presence of mycolactone suitable for district-level laboratories is under investigation.\\nCulture is difficult because of the slow growth rate of the mycobacteria.\\nThe WHO recommends combination therapy with rifampicin (10mg/kg per day PO) plus either streptomycin (15 mg/kg per day IM) or clarithromycin (7.5 mg/kg twice daily PO) for 8 weeks, which achieve high specific cure rates. Local heat application at temperatures >40°C for several weeks has also been shown to be curative. Special attention must be paid to patients co-infected with HIV, who are at increased risk for complications.\\nCareful wound management, pain relief, surgical excision and skin grafting as well as physiotherapy for restricted movements remain indispensable cornerstones of BU treatment. Extensive necrosis of subcutaneous tissue at diagnosis may cause a sig-nificant increase in ulcer size under treatment. Once secondary bacterial infection has been ruled out, this must not be mistaken for treatment failure. Local or distant new lesions may become evident during or after treatment. This so called 'paradoxical reaction' is thought to be caused by a local host immune reconstitution syndrome because of a fall in mycolactone levels. The distinction between bacterial secondary infection, recurrence and paradoxical reactions remains challenging and should involve expert advice.\",\n",

The laboratory results\\nreveal pancytopenia and an elevated C-reactive protein.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat is the Single Most Important Test to be Done\\nin This Patient?\\nThe most important test to be done is an HIV serology. The\\npatient presents with fever, unexplained weight loss, lymph-\\nadenopathy and a papular rash; his blood results show pan-\\ncytopenia. Each of these conditions alone should warrant\\nHIV testing.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat is Your Differential Diagnosis?\\nCommon causes of fever, generalized lymphadenopathy and\\nhepatosplenomegaly are infectious diseases and neoplasms.\\n43\\n44 CHAPTER 17 A 34-Year-Old Man from Thailand With Fever and a Papular Rash\\nApart from HIV, CMV and EBV infection should be\\nconsidered. All three of these viral infections may present\\nwith fever, hepatosplenomegaly and a rash, but umbilicated\\npapular lesions are not part of the clinical picture. However,\\nin HIV-infected individuals, mollusca contagiosa are com-\\nmon, which resemble the lesions seen in this patient.\\nDisseminated tuberculosis and infections with atypical\\nmycobacteria are important differential diagnoses. Both\\ncan also present with cutaneous manifestations. An infection\\nthat resembles mycobacterioses in many ways is melioidosis.\\nMelioidosis is one of the leading causes of community-\\nacquired septicaemia in Thailand. It may present with\\nlymphadenitis and disseminated papular skin lesions.\\nBartonella spp. (B. henselae, B. quintana) cause bacillary\\nangiomatosis in immunosuppressed individuals. Bacillary\\nangiomatosis presents with non-specific systemic symptoms\\nand umbilicated papular skin lesions. However, these pap-\\nules are usually erythematous.\\nFungal infections to consider in this patient are cryptococ-\\ncosis, histoplasmosis and talaromycosis (previously\\npenicilliosis), which are all commonly associated with immu-\\nnosuppression but may also rarely occur in non-\\nimmunosuppressed individuals. All three may also present\\nwith umbilicated, papular skin lesions. Visceral leishmaniasis\\ncauses fever, wasting, hepatosplenomegaly and pancytope-\\nnia. It does however not cause a papular rash. It has been\\nreported from Thailand, but appears to be uncommon.\\nNeoplasms to consider include lymphomas and non-\\nmalignant neoplastic conditions such as HHV-8-associated\\nCastleman's disease.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe HIV test came back positive. The patient was found to\\nbe highly immunosuppressed, with a CD4 cell count of 2/µL\\n(normal range: 500-1000/μL).\\nBlood cultures were taken. A fine needle aspirate of the\\nlymph node and a skin biopsy were performed, and the mate-\\nrial was sent for microbiological and pathological work-up.\\nHistopathology of the lymph node biopsy showed multiple\\nyeast-like structures (Fig. 17.2). There were no acid-fast\\nbacilli seen. The blood culture and cultures from the skin\\nbiopsy and lymph node all grew Talaromyces (Penicillium)\\nmarneffei.\\nand the patient\\nwas started on a 2-week course of intravenous liposomal\\namphotericin B followed by oral itraconazole. On 3-week\\nfollow-up he was afebrile and gaining weight. Antiretroviral\\ntherapy (ART) was initiated.\\nSix months later the patient presented with a recurrence of\\nhis cervical lymphadenopathy. A talaromycosis relapse was\\nsuspected. However, this time an infection with atypical\\nmycobacteria was found. His CD4 count had come up to\\n• Fig. 17.2 Histology of the supraclavicular lymph node showing multiple\\nround-shaped yeast-like structures (PAS stain, × 400).

This second infec-\\ntion within 6 months after starting ART was interpreted as\\nan immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) of\\nthe unmasking type.\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nTalaromycosis (Penicilliosis)\\nTalaromycosis (previously penicilliosis) is caused by Talaromyces\\n(Penicillium) marneffei, a dimorphic fungus endemic to East and\\nSouth-east Asia. Incidence of talaromycosis has increased in\\nparallel with the AIDS pandemic. It is the third commonest AIDS-\\nrelated opportunistic infection in Thailand and Vietnam after\\ntuberculosis and cryptococcosis. Talaromycosis has also been\\nreported in immunosuppressed travellers to endemic areas.\\nAcquisition and transmission of talaromycosis, either by inhalation\\nor by direct inoculation, have not been fully understood; the only\\nknown hosts are humans and bamboo rats.\\nTalaromycosis usually affects severely immunocompromised\\nindividuals who frequently have other concurrent opportunistic\\ninfections. Patients present with non-specific symptoms such as\\nprolonged fever, fatigue, weight loss and diarrhoea. Clinical signs\\nare lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and anaemia. Gen-\\neralized umbilicated papular skin lesions can help the clinician\\nnarrow down the differential diagnosis. The papules are often\\nlocated on the face, on the chest and on the extremities. Lung\\ninvolvement is common and chest radiography may reveal diffuse\\nreticulonodular or alveolar infiltrates.\\nDiagnosis is made by identification of the fungus by micros-\\ncopy and culture. Blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or biopsies\\nof skin, lymph nodes or bone marrow are appropriate clinical\\nspecimens. Microscopical examination reveals extracellular and\\nintracellular yeasts. The extracellular forms often have a trans-\\nverse septum as a result of binary fission.\\nTreatment is with intravenous amphotericin B for 2 weeks\\nfollowed by oral itraconazole.

       " 'A 14-Year-Old Boy from Malawi Who Has Been Bitten by a Snake GREGOR POLLACH Clinical Presentation History A 14-year-old Malawian boy presents to a local hospital because of an extensive necrotic wound on his right foot. Three weeks earlier he was playing with his friends on a path leading through rocky grassland to the maize field of his family when he stepped on a snake. The snake was brown with V-shaped black bands on its back, and it was approxi- mately one metre long. His friends told his mother later that the snake had hissed loudly but did not move away before biting him - which the boy did not even realize, being busy chasing a football. Shortly after the bite, haemorrhagic bullae formed on the right leg. His gums started to bleed and he vomited extensively. He was taken to a local traditional healer for treatment. His bleeding and vomiting settled; however, he developed intense pain and swelling at the site of the bite. • Fig. 26.1 The right foot and ankle with extensive tissue necrosis 3 weeks after a snake bite.

       " \"A 35-Year-Old Male Farmer from Peru With a Chronic Ulcer and Multiple Nodular Lesions on the Arm\\nFERNANDO MEJÍA CORDERO, BEATRIZ BUSTAMANTE AND EDUARDO H. GOTUZZO\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 35-year-old farmer from the Peruvian highlands presents to a reference hospital in the capital, Lima, with a 2-month history of a slowly growing ulcer and multiple painless nod-ules on his left arm.\\nTwo months before presentation, the patient suffered a scratch on his left hand from a tree branch while working in the fields. After a few days, he noticed a small painless ery-thematous papule that later developed into a pustule. He took antibiotics without improvement. Over the following weeks new pustules appeared, and the lesion started to ulcer-ate and increased in size, despite continued antibiotics and topical traditional medicines. Four weeks after the initial papule the patient noticed painless firm nodules on his left forearm. The patient was seen at a regional hospital and trea-ted empirically for cutaneous leishmaniasis with a 20-day course of pentavalent antimonials, but showed no improve-ment. He was then referred for further diagnosis and treatment.\\nThe patient was previously healthy. He denied recent contact with animals or travel.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe patient appears generally well. His vital signs are normal and he is afebrile.\\nOn his left hand there is a single ulcerative lesion (20 × 30 mm) with irregular elevated borders (Fig. 34.1) and mul-tiple subcutaneous erythematous nodules (10 × 10mm) along the lymphatic tract of the left arm (Fig. 34.2). The rest of the physical examination is normal.\\n• Fig. 34.1 Initial ulcerated lesion on the left hand. Note the pustular lesion near the ulcer.\\nLaboratory Results\\nThe WBC is 4.5 × 109/L (reference range 4-10 × 10º/L) with normal differential count; haemoglobin is 11.3g/dL (12-16g/dL). The remainder of the full blood count is normal.\\nQuestions\\n1. What are your differential diagnoses?\\n2. How would you approach this patient?\\nDiscussion\\nA Peruvian farmer presents with a chronic ulcerative lesion on his left hand and contiguous involvement of the lym-phatic tract compatible with nodular lymphangitis. The lesions started after a minor traumatic injury. The patient denies systemic symptoms. Laboratory examination shows mild anaemia.\\n• Fig. 34.2 Multiple subcutaneous nodules along the lymphatic tract.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Are Your Differential Diagnoses?\\nIn Peru, the common differential diagnoses of a chronic ulcer with nodular lymphangitis include cutaneous leishmaniasis, sporotrichosis and mycobacterial infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M. marinum.\\nLeishmaniasis is endemic in the Andes between 1000 and 3000 m altitude and in the Amazon Basin. The patient's ori-gin and clinical presentation are highly suggestive of cutane-ous leishmaniasis. However, the lack of clinical improvement after a complete course of pentavalent antimonials (>80% cure rate) makes this diagnosis unlikely.\\nSporotrichosis is the second most important diagnosis to consider. The patient's clinical features are typical and the disease is commonly seen in Peru. Another diagnosis to keep in mind is secondary cutaneous tuberculosis, especially because the patient has likely been exposed to M. tuberculosis during his lifetime. The patient has no history of exposure to fresh and saltwater environments to suggest infection with M. marinum. Nocardiosis (Nocardia brasiliensis) and tularae-mia (Francisella tularensis) are other causes of nodular lym-phangitis but are unlikely in this patient, because nocardiosis is rare and tularaemia has never been reported in the southern hemisphere.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow Would You Approach This Patient?\\nThe first step is the collection of specimens for microscopy (smears for Gram, Giemsa and Ziehl-Neelsen stains), cul-ture and, if available, PCR for Leishmania and Mycobacte-rium species and Sporothrix schenckii. Specimens should be collected by scraping of the base of the active ulcer, biopsy of the edge of the lesion, and fine-needle aspiration of one of the lymphatic nodules. If available, a leishmanin skin test would be a useful diagnostic tool. Fungi such as S. schenckii grow on special media and the laboratory should be informed of the clinical suspicion of sporotrichosis. The initial evalu-ation should also include chest radiography and a PPD skin test to rule out tuberculosis.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe chest x-ray was normal and PPD skin testing was negative. No leishmania parasites were observed by direct microscopy, and the leishmanin skin test was negative. Leishmania culture was not performed. Mycobacterial cultures were negative. However, culture of the ulcer scraping and nodule aspiration were positive for S. schenckii.\\nThe mild anaemia was likely to be unrelated. The patient was started on itraconazole PO 200 mg/day. After 8 months of treatment the ulcer and nodular lesions had resolved and the patient was considered to be cured.\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nSporotrichosis\\nSporotrichosis is a sub-acute to chronic fungal infection caused by S. schenckii, a dimorphic fungus with a worldwide distribu-tion, existing as a saprophytic mould in soil and plants and as a yeast in tissues. Cutaneous sporotrichosis is the most common form of the disease, which is acquired by inoculation during minor injury by animal bites, plant thorns or other cutting vege-tation. Sporotrichosis has in addition emerged as a zoonosis transmitted mainly by infected cats, with epidemic outbreaks in Brazil and some countries in South America, caused by S. brasiliensis. The upper limbs are most commonly affected. The infection is usually limited to the cutaneous, subcutaneous and lymphatic tissues surrounding the injury. The initial papule at the inoculation site typically grows slowly into a nodule and then ulcerates. Contiguous lymphatic spread is very common (48-92%) and is referred to as 'nodular lymphangitis' or 'spor-otrichoid lymphangitis'. The majority of cases are sporadic. Farmers, veterinarians, rose gardeners and others regularly engaged in outdoor activities are at highest risk. Persons with pre-existing chronic conditions (e.g., alcohol abuse) or immu-nosuppression (e.g., HIV/AIDS) are at risk of developing pul-monary sporotrichosis after mould inhalation or disseminated sporotrichosis after haematogenous spread from the cutaneous lesion.\\nThe fungi are scarce in tissues and generally not detected on microscopy. Serology is not useful because of low sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosis is based on isolation of the organism by culture of the skin biopsy, lesion aspirate, or sputum. S. schenckii grows on Saboraud agar at 25 to 27°C. Also, molecular methods may be used.\\nSpontaneous resolution of the lesions is rare. Itraconazole PO 200 mg/day is considered the drug of choice for cutaneous sporotrichosis. The treatment should be continued for 2 to 4 weeks after resolution of all lesions, typically 3 to 6 months but sometimes even requiring years. Saturated solution of potas-sium iodide, a cheap and effective drug, has also been widely used but its low tolerability and many unpleasant side effects (e.g., salivary gland swelling, metallic taste, rash and fever) limit its use. Terbinafine is also an alternative treatment. Itraconazole (200mg PO bd for 1-2 years) is also the preferred drug for pulmonary or osteoarticular sporotrichosis. In severely ill patients or patients with disseminated disease, initial therapy with amphotericin B is recommended, with conversion to oral itra-conazole after a favourable response and stabilization. Relapses are infrequent with all forms and therapy, although long-term secondary prophylaxis might be required in patients with HIV/ AIDS.\\nFurther Reading\\n1. Hay RJ.

       " 'A 41-Year-Old Male Traveller Returning from Australia With Itchy Eruptions on His Thighs CAMILLA ROTHE Clinical Presentation History A 41-year-old male yoga teacher presents to a travel clinic in Europe because of itchy skin eruptions on both upper thighs for the past week. He has just returned from a 10-day trip to northern Australia where he attended a yoga seminar. On his way to Australia he had stopped over on a Thai island for a 3-day beach holiday. Just after his arrival in Australia he developed three intensely itchy skin eruptions on both upper thighs. The itch is so intense that at times it keeps him awake at night. There has been no fever, no cough or wheeze and he is otherwise completely well. Clinical Findings On both upper thighs there are a total of three reddish, serpiginous tracks, about 2 mm in width (Fig. 42.1). The inguinal lymph nodes are not enlarged. The chest is clear. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. • Fig. 42.1 Three track-like skin eruptions on both upper thighs causing intense itching. Questions 1. What is the clinical syndrome and what is the differential diagnosis? 2. What management would you recommend? Discussion A 41-year-old European man presents to a travel clinic with itchy serpiginous skin lesions. He has recently returned from a trip to Asia and Australia. Answer to Question 1 What is the Clinical Syndrome and What is the Differential Diagnosis? The clinical syndrome is a creeping eruption. A creeping eruption is defined as a linear or serpiginous, slightly elevated, erythematous track that moves forward in an irregular pattern. The most common cause of creeping eruptions seen in returned travellers is cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) caused by larvae of animal hookworms. Creeping eruptions can also result from infection with larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis (larva currens, i.e. running larva), but this can easily be distinguished from CLM. S. stercoralis larvae move several centimetres an hour, that is considerably faster than larvae in cutaneous larva migrans. The eruptions in larva currens persist only for a few hours, whereby in CLM the track may stay for weeks. Creeping eruptions can also be caused by adult nematodes such as Gnathostoma species and trematodes (Fasciola species). The larvae of parasitic flies have also been shown to cause creeping eruptions (migratory myiasis). However, cutaneous larva migrans caused by zoonotic hookworms is by far the commonest cause of creeping eruption seen in travel clinics worldwide. The patient was probably infected while lying on the beach or performing yoga exercises in the sand.',\n",

Then, an ultrasound and a CT scan of\\nthe liver had revealed two calcified cystic lesions, one in the right\\nliver lobe, another smaller cyst in the left liver lobe (Figs. 50.1A\\nand B and 50.2). Serology was positive for Echinococcus granu-\\nlosus and a diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis (CE) was made.\\nSince both cyst walls were already calcified, anthelmintic\\ntreatment was not considered an option as the bioavailability\\nof albendazole in cysts with calcified cyst walls is rather poor.\\nBeing free of symptoms, the patient refused surgical treat-\\nment. The cysts were monitored regularly by ultrasound\\nfor signs of spontaneous involution.\\nClinical Findings\\nA 24-year-old man in fair general condition with scleral jaun-\\ndice. Blood pressure 110/70mmHg, pulse 64 bpm, temper-\\nature 36°C (96.8°F). There is right upper quadrant and\\nepigastric tenderness, but no guarding.\\nLaboratory Findings\\nThe full blood count is normal. Additional results are shown\\nin Table 50.1.\\n• Fig. 50.1 Ultrasound scan of the liver at diagnosis 3 years before current presentation reveals two cystic lesions.\\nOne lesion is located in the right liver lobe (7 x 6cm).

What is the suspected diagnosis and how would you\\napproach this patient?\\n2. Which differential diagnoses should be considered in a\\npatient with cystic liver lesions?\\nDiscussion\\nA young man of Turkish origin presents with right\\nupper quadrant pain and jaundice. He was diagnosed\\nwith CE 3 years earlier and has not been on any specific\\ntreatment.\\nIn case of biliary obstruction, the first step is to restore the\\nbiliary flow by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography\\n(ERC). ERC is both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool\\nin cases of biliary obstruction; cyst content can be extracted\\nfrom the hepatic or common bile duct. In case of bacterial\\ncholangitis, the patient should receive antibiotic treatment\\nto cover for Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes.\\nOnce biliary flow is restored and cholangitis has settled,\\nthe cyst can be surgically removed in a second step.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhich Differential Diagnoses Should be\\nConsidered in a Patient With Cystic Liver Lesions?\\nThe main differential diagnoses in this patient with cystic\\nliver lesions and liquid cyst content are a congenital simple\\nhepatic cyst and pseudocysts (necrotic cavity) in alveolar\\nechinococcosis (E. multilocularis).\\nDepending on the presence of systemic symptoms and\\nsigns and liquid versus solid cyst content, infectious causes\\nlike abscesses (bacterial, amoebic) or tuberculoma must be\\nconsidered.\\nIn addition, benign and malignant liver tumours or\\nmetastases are relevant differentials.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nOn ERC, biliary obstruction because of a cystobiliary fistula\\nwas found. CE cyst content was removed from the common\\nbile duct and the bile flow was restored. The patient's cho-\\nlangitis was treated with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.\\nOnce the inflammation settled, the patient was referred\\nfor surgery and partial cystectomy was performed on\\nboth cysts.\\nThe patient has been followed up for 9 years after surgery\\nand has had no recurrence. He is considered cured and fur-\\nther follow-up visits are not needed.\\nThis case illustrates several learning points. In countries\\nwith low CE-endemicity provenance from a hyperendemic\\nregion is the single most important risk factor for CE in cystic\\nliver lesions.\\nCE is generally a benign disease with the exception of\\ncomplicated cysts; in this case a cyst with biliary fistula.\\nCE cysts are currently classified by the WHO into six stages:\\nCE1 and 2 (active), CE3a and 3b (transitional) and CE4 and\\n5 (inactive).\\nA very important question is which cysts can be left\\nuntreated and only observed ('watch and wait'). There is\\nfairly solid evidence that inactive CE4 and CE5 cysts can\\nbe left untreated if they are not in critical sites.\\nIn this patient the cyst walls of both cysts (CE1, CE3b)\\nwere calcified (Figs. 50.1 and 50.2). Previously, calcification\\nwas described only as a feature of CE5 cysts; this was later\\nextended to CE4 cysts and has now been shown to occur\\nin all cyst stages.\\nRetrospectively this case illustrates that surgical treatment\\nwas rightly offered to the patient at initial diagnosis.\\nCystobiliary fistulas are some of the major reasons for\\ncomplications in CE of the liver (as are cystobronchial fistu-\\nlas in pulmonary CE). Fistulating cysts should be surgically\\ntreated before complications arise. The key question is how\\nto identify fistulas early to prevent complications. Previously,\\nendoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) has been\\nadvocated as the method of choice. However, it has become\\nevident that intracystic pressure may be too high for the con-\\ntrast medium to enter. If available, MRI with magnetic res-\\nonance cholangiography (MRC) is an alternative option,\\nwith very good detection rates.\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nCystic Echinococcosis\\nCE is an infection with the larval form of the dog tapeworm\\nEchinococcus granulosus. It occurs worldwide with high ende-\\nmicity in the Mediterranean basin, the Near and Middle East,\\nNorth and East Africa, central Asia and Latin America.\\nHumans become infected by ingestion of eggs of E.\\ngranulosus.\\nSymptoms may occur months to years after infection because\\nof mass effects of the growing cyst or because of complications.\\nLiver (70%) and lung (15-30%) are the most commonly affected\\norgans. Cyst complications include fistulas leading to biliary or\\nbronchial obstruction, bacterial superinfection, cyst rupture\\nleading to anaphylaxis, embolism of cyst content and compres-\\nsion syndromes.\\nDiagnosis of CE is based on imaging, mainly on ultrasound,\\nwhich is crucial for the diagnosis and classification of disease\\nactivity. MRI or CT should be used when cysts are inaccessible by\\nultrasound.\\nSerology is hampered by a lack of sensitivity and specificity.\\nIn unclear cases, diagnostic cyst puncture and aspiration may be\\nperformed by experienced examiners. If CE is suspected,\\nhowever, albendazole needs to be given peri-interventionally.\\nGenerally, four treatment modalities are available: anthelmintic\\ntreatment, percutaneous sterilization techniques, surgery and a\\n'watch and wait' approach.\\nManagement of CE patients in general depends not only\\non the individual case but also on local resources and expertise.\\nLong-term follow-up is important to detect recurrence of\\ndisease.\\nFurther Reading\\n1.

       " 'A 24-year-old Malawian businessman presents to your clinic having noticed dark spots on his arm and leg for the last month. The lesions are progressing and he is now getting facial swelling. On questioning, he also reports a 3-month history of cough and worsening shortness of breath. He has no constitutional symptoms of weight loss, fevers or night sweats. His cough is productive of white sputum. He has no history of previous tuberculosis. He tested positive for HIV a week before coming to your clinic and has not yet started antiretroviral medication. The patient appears comfortable at rest with moderate facial oedema (Fig. 59.1). His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), respiratory rate 32 breath cycles per minute and pulse 102 bpm. Widespread dark-purplish plaques are noted on the skin (Fig. 59.1) and palate. On respiratory examination, he has decreased air entry and dullness at the right lung base. He has swelling of his right leg from the foot to the knee, with prominent dark plaques which are coalescing (Fig. 59.2). The rest of the physical examination is normal. His main concern was shortness of breath. His wife was also HIV-positive but not on ART, and his two children 6 and 4 years old had not yet been tested. His CD4 count was 134 cells/µL, HB 10.2 g/dL and MCV 88.4 fL. Other parameters were normal. His chest radiograph showed bilateral patchy opacifications in the lower and mid zones of the lungs (Fig. 59.3). Peribronchovascular changes are typically seen in patients with pulmonary KS. Sputum and GeneXpert tests were negative for the presence of tuberculosis. A bronchoscopy was attempted but failed because of technical difficulties. The patient made no improvement with a short course of oral antibiotics. He was referred to start antiretroviral medication and palliative chemotherapy.',\n",
       " \"67 A 24-Year-Old Woman from the Peruvian Andes With Fever and Abdominal Pain FÁTIMA CONCHA VELASCO AND EDUARDO H. GOTUZZO Clinical Presentation History A 24-year-old woman from the highlands of Peru is trans- ferred to a hospital in the capital, Lima, with a 2-month his- tory of upper abdominal pain, weight loss (5 kg), nausea and vomiting. She tried analgesics, which did not control the pain. She also reports intermittent fevers for the past 2 weeks. Three days previously, she was seen at the emergency room of the same hospital for the above-mentioned com- plaints. Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple hypoechoic lesions in her liver. She was treated with ceftriaxone and met- ronidazole for suspected pyogenic liver abscesses but did not show any clinical improvement. The patient reported that about 2 to 3 months ago she started taking over-the-counter medicines to lose weight and changed her diet to vegetarian food. She also reported the consumption of energetic hot drinks made from alfalfa and watercress. Prior to her current illness, she was healthy. She is single and has no children. Clinical Findings The patient looks ill, with pale mucous membranes but no jaundice. Her blood pressure is 95/60mmHg, pulse 105 bpm and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F). On palpation of the abdomen there is right upper quadrant tenderness, and the liver is slightly enlarged with a liver span of 15 cm. The rest of the physical examination is normal. Laboratory Results Table 67.1 shows the patient's laboratory results, taken in the emergency room. Imaging A contrast-enhanced CT scan of her abdomen shows multiple hypodense, non-enhancing lesions in the liver (Fig. 67.1). Questions 1. What are your differential diagnoses? 2. What would be the most useful investigation to establish the diagnosis? Discussion A young woman from the Peruvian Andes presents with a history of fever, weight loss and abdominal pain. The blood count reveals pronounced eosinophilia. The abdominal CT scan shows hypodense non-enhancing hepatic lesions.

Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Differential Diagnoses? The patient was first treated for suspected pyogenic liver abscesses based upon the presence of fever, right upper abdominal pain and hypoechoic liver lesions on ultrasound. However, the lack of any improvement after 3 days of appropriate treatment makes this diagnosis less likely. In a patient from the Andes with high eosinophilia and a known history of alfalfa and watercress consumption, fasci- oliasis is the most important diagnosis to consider. Amoebic liver abscess is also part of the differential diagnosis, but eosinophilia and the presence of multiple lesions are not typ- ical. Also, the infection is uncommon in young women and should respond to metronidazole treatment. Other endemic infections in Peru that could present with similar symptoms are brucellosis, visceral toxocariasis or sec- ondary infections in the context of other infections (i.e. ascari- asis and hydatid disease). Opisthorchis, another liver fluke, could be considered if the patient had a travel history to South-east Asia, as the condition is not present in the Americas. Answer to Question 2 What Would Be the Most Useful Investigation to Establish the Diagnosis? Infection with the sheep liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) is top of the list of differential diagnoses in this patient with liver lesions, eosinophilia and a history of watercress consumption. Because ova appear in the stool only later in the course of the disease, serology is the diagnostic tool of choice. The Fas2 ELISA is a serological method with good sensitivity and spec- ificity to diagnose the acute phase of F. hepatica infection. Liver biopsy is invasive and has little benefit in this con- text; it could be considered if tests are negative and all treatments fail.\",\n",

She was born in Santa Cruz (Bolivia)\\nand arrived in Europe 4 months prior. She has been living\\nin an urban environment for the past 20 years but grew\\nup in a rural area during her childhood.\\nShe reports a 2-year history of progressive dyspnoea at\\nmoderate exertion (New York Heart Association grade II)\\nalong with self-limiting palpitations. She has no other rele-\\nvant medical history and does not take any medication.\\nShe expresses the wish to become pregnant.\\nClinical Findings\\nOn examination, the blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg. The\\npulse is regular at 40 bpm. SpO2 is 99% on ambient air. On\\nauscultation, cardiac sounds are clear and there are no mur-\\nmurs. The chest is clear. There is no peripheral oedema and\\nthe jugular venous pressure is not raised.\\nLaboratory Results\\nFull blood count and basic blood chemistry tests are normal.\\nHer ECG is shown in Figure 89.1.

If a patient was diagnosed with Chagas disease, how\\nwould you proceed to assess organ involvement? Which\\nare the indications for treatment of Chagas disease?\\nDiscussion\\nA Bolivian woman of childbearing age presents to an outpa-\\ntient clinic for the first time. She complains of progressive\\ndyspnoea and palpitations. She has no clinical signs of heart\\nfailure. However, CXR shows moderate cardiomegaly and\\nthere is sinus bradycardia with right bundle branch block\\non her ECG.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nIn a Recent Migrant from Bolivia, Which Different\\nPathologies Should Be Screened For?\\nFollowing the guidelines of the European Centre for Disease\\nPrevention and Control (ECDC), newly arrived migrants\\nfrom highly endemic countries should be offered a screening\\npanel including screening for active and latent tuberculosis,\\nHIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and strongyloidiasis. In\\nmigrants from Latin America, especially from Bolivia, this\\nscreening panel should include Chagas disease, because prev-\\nalence rates are high and Chagas may be asymptomatic.\\nIf a chronic phase of Chagas disease is suspected, screen-\\ning is usually performed with serological testing through\\ndetection of IgG antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi using\\ntwo different serological testing methods.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nIf a Patient Was Diagnosed With Chagas Disease,\\nHow Would You Proceed to Assess Organ\\nInvolvement? Which Are the Indications for\\nTreatment of Chagas Disease?\\nThe heart is the most frequently affected organ. Alterations\\nmost commonly seen include conduction disorders such as\\nbundle branch blocks and sinus node dysfunction\\n(Fig. 89.1). Myocardial involvement can progress to dilated\\ncardiomyopathy (Fig. 89.1B). Gastrointestinal involvement\\nis less common and manifestations comprise motility disor-\\nders or megaviscera.\\nAs a general approach it is therefore reasonable to start\\nwith an ECG, chest x-ray and barium enema. In addition,\\nreferral to a cardiologist for echocardiography and 24-hour\\nHolter ECG would be recommended.\\nThere are two trypanocidal treatments: benznidazole and\\nnifurtimox. Treatment is always recommended for acute and\\ncongenital Chagas disease as well as for patients younger than\\n18 years in the chronic phase. In older patients with chronic\\ndisease, treatment is controversial. Trypanocidal treatment is\\nusually offered to patients in the indeterminate phase with\\nmild-to-moderate organ involvement.

       " \"A 31-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and a recent onset of intermittent fever, diarrhea, and progressive weakness.\\nThe patient was well until 20 months earlier, when he was treated at another hospital for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma; a serologic test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies was positive. When a rash developed after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was administered, pentamidine was substituted, with improvement. Radiation therapy was given for Kaposi's sarcoma. Sixteen months before admission zidovudine was begun. Acyclovir was initiated later because of recurrent herpes simplex lesions in the perianal area, and ketoconazole was added because of intraoral thrush.\\nTen months before entry the patient was referred to this hospital. He continued to receive the same medications and required transfusions approximately every six weeks because of anemia that was ascribed to the use of zidovudine. Chronic diarrhea was present; a stool culture and three stool examinations for ova and parasites were negative. The diarrhea improved slightly after the lactose intake was reduced.\\nSix months before admission an ophthalmologist found an area of retinal thickening and yellowish infiltrate in the superotemporal region of the right eye, with overlying vitreous haze and no evidence of peripheral hemorrhage or retinal detachment; the left eye was normal. The diagnosis was uncertain, and a decision was made to follow the patient without a change in his medications.\\nThree months before admission the patient began to have bifrontal headaches, fever, malaise, and an increase in his chronic diarrhea. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain was negative. An x-ray film of the chest was normal. A lumbar puncture yielded clear, colorless cerebrospinal fluid that contained 2 white cells per cubic millimeter; a differential count revealed 91 percent lymphocytes, 6 percent neutrophils, and 3 percent nonhematic cells; the glucose and protein were normal; microscopical examination of a specimen of the fluid disclosed no fungi; serologic tests for syphilis and cryptococcal antigen and a culture were negative. A stool culture and a test on a stool specimen for Clostridium difficile toxin were negative. Diphenoxylate hydrochloride-atropine sulfate was administered for diarrhea, with improvement.\\nFour weeks before entry the patient returned to the hospital, still reporting intermittent fever. His headaches continued, and arthralgia and myalgia were present. Another ophthalmologic examination disclosed little change in the right retina; focal retinitis was present in the temporal and inferotemporal regions of the left eye. A course of ganciclovir was refused by the patient. The laboratory values are presented in Table 1. A viral culture of a specimen of urine yielded cytomegalovirus; culture of a buffy-coat specimen was negative. A culture of blood drawn one month before admission was negative. During the two weeks before entry the fever and diarrhea persisted.\\nTwelve days before admission the hematocrit was 25 percent; the white-cell count was 1800, with 80 percent neutrophils, 15 percent lymphocytes, and 5 percent monocytes on an automated differential count that is insensitive to eosinophils. Two additional units of packed red cells were transfused. Fever and diarrhea continued while the patient vacationed in the Caribbean. He took food and fluids poorly, became progressively weaker, and was admitted to the hospital.\\nThe patient was homosexual. He had lost an uncertain amount of weight during the preceding month. He continued to take his usual medications as well as ibuprofen for headaches. There was no history of photophobia, stiff neck, chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, edema, chills, or sweats.\\nThe temperature was 36.3°C per rectum, the pulse was 96, and the respirations were 24. The blood pressure was 80/50 mm Hg.\\nOn physical examination the patient was cachectic and dehydrated. A purple plaque, 3 by 4 cm, was present on the hard palate, covered by a lacy, white exudate. No cutaneous lesion or lymphadenopathy was found. There was bilateral temporal wasting; the neck was supple. Inspiratory crackles were heard at both lung bases. The heart sounds were normal; no murmur or S3 or S₁ sound was heard. On abdominal examination bowel sounds were present; there was moderate diffuse tenderness; the liver edge was palpated 4 cm below the right costal margin; the spleen was not felt. A stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. On neurologic examination the patient was alert and oriented. Cranial-nerve functions were intact although the right pupil was 3 mm and the left 4 mm; both pupils reacted to light. Strength was graded 4/5. The deep tendon reflexes were + in the upper extremities and + + in the lower extremities; the plantar responses were flexor.\\nThe hematologic values are presented in Table 2, and the other laboratory values are listed in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed an R-wave axis of +55 degrees, with low voltage; nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities were present, and there was a marked delay in R-wave progression in the right precordial leads; the ST-segments were elevated in the right precordial leads. A single x-ray film of the chest (Fig. 1) revealed slight cardiac and hilar enlargement, with a patchy opacity in the left mid-lung region and at the base of the right lung; the cardiomediastinal silhouette and bones were normal. An x-ray film of the abdomen (Fig. 2) showed air within the ascending, transverse, and descending colon, which appeared foreshortened and ahaustral; there was a paucity of bowel gas in the superior portion of the abdomen, but air was observed within the rectum. Cultures of sputum and cerebrospinal fluid, obtained earlier, showed no acid-fast bacilli. Acetaminophen and ranitidine were given by mouth. Normal saline was administered by vein, and heparin was given subcutaneously.\\nIn the early hours of the second hospital day the temperature rose to 39.6°C, and the respirations increased to 28 per minute; the blood pressure was 90/55 mm Hg. Diffuse tenderness was again noted in all extremities. Oliguria was present. The hematologic values are presented in Table 2, and the other laboratory values are listed in Table 1. Another electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at a rate of 130 and showed no other important change. X-ray films of the chest revealed a diffuse interstitial abnormality with an air-space component that was most pronounced in the left mid-lung region and was considerably more prominent than on the previous day; a moderate left pleural effusion was present; the heart was larger than on the last examination, and fullness was noted in both hilar regions. X-ray films of the abdomen disclosed rigid-appearing, featureless segments of the colon; no loops of bowel were dilated, and no free air was seen. During the day the patient became progressively more dyspneic. In the late afternoon the blood pressure was 70/40 mm Hg, with a pulsus paradoxus of 8 to 10 cm; the patient was in severe respiratory distress, with gurgling of large-airway secretions and central cyanosis; the jugular venous pressure was 7 cm; diffuse rhonchi were present bilaterally, with a left pleural friction rub and a questionable right pleural friction rub; no murmur, pericardial friction rub, or S3 sound was heard; the abdomen was normal, and no peripheral edema was detected. One hundred percent oxygen was administered by face mask.\\nLater that afternoon the patient was found in cardiorespiratory arrest, and attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation were unsuccessful.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. PAUL F. KAMITSUKA*: In summary, this 31-year-old homosexual patient presented to the hospital in the terminal stages of HIV disease, having had a number of HIV-associated illnesses, including pneumocystis pneumonia, Kaposi's sarcoma, perianal herpes infection, oral candidiasis, retinitis, transfusion-dependent anemia, and chronic diarrhea of 10 months' duration. Over the three months before death he had a progressive systemic illness characterized by fever, bifrontal headaches, arthralgias, myalgias, progressive weakness, transfusion-dependent anemia, and persistent diarrhea. On presentation he had bibasilar crackles, a negative cardiac examination, diffuse abdominal tenderness with hepatosplenomegaly, diffuse muscle tenderness, and evidence of muscle weakness. He had moderate pancytopenia. Hypoalbuminemia consistent with severe nutritional depletion was present, as was evidence of renal insufficiency, which was due at least in part to volume depletion. Elevated serum levels of enzymes, probably of muscle origin, were noted. An initial x-ray film of the chest revealed patchy infiltrates of the left mid-lung field and the right-lung base. The abdominal films confirmed the presence of hepatosplenomegaly, and there was apparent downward displacement of the colon. The radiologic appearance of the colon suggested a diffuse colitis, with loss of the normal haustral pattern and a foreshortened, rigid appearance. The brief hospital course was characterized by fulminant respiratory tract deterioration and hemodynamic embarrassment. A diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrate appeared overnight along with a marked increase in the left-sided infiltrate, which had both alveolar and reticulonodular components. A left pleural effusion appeared with auscultatory evidence of a friction rub, suggesting active pleural inflammation. Hilar fullness, possibly indicating hilar lymphadenopathy, was appreciated. Enlargement of the heart was noted in association with marked hypotension, cyanosis, and severe respiratory distress. The absence of an S3 gallop and the appearance of the x-ray film of the chest are against pulmonary edema secondary to heart failure as the cause of the patient's respiratory distress and suggest a primary pulmonary process. The electrocardiographic findings of low voltage and the ST-segment abnormalities in the setting of an enlarged cardiac silhouette raise the possibility of pericardial involvement with effusion and tamponade. The absence of prominent jugular venous distention or pulsus paradoxus is not inconsistent with tamponade, especially in the setting of intravascular volume depletion. The fulminant pulmonary and pleuropericardial processes culminated in cardiopulmonary arrest, with death within 24 hours of admission.\\nDr. Hahn, may we review the radiographic findings?\\nDR. PETER F. HAHN: A film of the chest taken on admission (Fig. 1) shows a diffuse interstitial pulmonary abnormality, with opacity increased more focally near the left hilus. Posteroanterior and lateral views of the chest obtained within 24 hours revealed enlargement of the cardiac shadow, especially as compared with a film taken one year earlier, and the hilar shadows had become enlarged. A small left pleural effusion is visible. There are several tiny nodules in the left lung. The interstitial abnormality demonstrated on the film taken on admission had become confluent around the left hilus. Films of the abdomen (Fig. 2) reveal hepatosplenomegaly. Bowel gas is absent from the mid-abdomen, suggesting the possibility of lymphadenopathy. From the pattern of gas and fluid within it the colon appears tubular, shortened, and featureless. There is no evidence of ascites.\\nDR. KAMITSUKA: This complicated case is perhaps best analyzed in two parts. I shall first discuss the subacute presentation after more than three months of symptoms. Secondly, I shall discuss the acute presentation with respiratory distress and hemodynamic compromise that led to death within a day of admission. I shall mention ways in which the subacute and acute processes might be related, recognizing that it is hazardous to apply the principle of diagnostic parsimony to patients with AIDS, since multiple concurrent pathologic processes are the rule.\\nAre there unifying diagnoses that could explain the constellation of findings that characterized the patient's subacute illness? Six disorders deserve consideration — lymphoma, metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma, disseminated cytomegalovirus infection, disseminated histoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and disseminated infection with Mycobacterium avium complex.\\nLymphoma occurs in 4 to 10 percent of patients with HIV disease and is the most prevalent HIV-related neoplasm after Kaposi's sarcoma. Typically, AIDS-related lymphomas are polyclonal B-cell tumors of high or intermediate grade and are widely disseminated at the time of presentation. The most frequent sites of extranodal involvement are the central nervous system, the gastrointestinal tract, the liver, and the bone marrow.2-7 The elevated lactic dehydrogenase level in the patient under discussion raises this diagnostic possibility, although this enzyme is elevated in a wide variety of other diseases. The patient's extensive transfusion requirement in the setting of moderate pancytopenia also raises the possibility of lymphoma. The transfusion dependence was attributed to zidovudine. However, the patient's mean corpuscular volume was only 92 µm³ per cell on admission. In the absence of iron deficiency or an underlying hematologic abnormality, such as alpha-thalassemia, the failure of the mean corpuscular volume to rise to 110 μm³ per cell is a useful clue that patients may not be taking their zidovudine. If that was true in this case, an alternative explanation for his transfusion requirement should be sought. AIDS-related lymphoma could explain the fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and transfusion requirement. Although the large bowel can be involved by lymphoma, a diffuse enterocolitis, such as is suggested by the radiographic findings in this case, rarely occurs with this tumor.9\\nVisceral involvement by Kaposi's sarcoma is common and may occur independently of or in association with cutaneous involvement.10-13 Fever and hepatosplenomegaly are both frequent manifestations of visceral disease.13,14 Gastrointestinal tract involvement is also common, usually taking the form of discrete submucosal nodules that most often affect the stomach and duodenum.15-17 However, Kaposi's sarcoma may present as a colitis, with clinical and radiographic findings that closely mimic those of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, including loss of the haustral pattern and segmental or diffuse fine mucosal ulceration.18,19 Mucosal biopsies are misleading in such cases, revealing inflammatory-cell infiltrates, crypt abscesses, and mucin-cell depletion consistent with inflammatory bowel disease but failing to include submucosal infiltration with the typical findings of Kaposi's sarcoma. Such presentations are rare, however. In addition, this patient's marked transfusion requirement cannot be explained by this diagnosis in the absence of bleeding.\\nDisseminated cytomegalovirus infection is another important consideration in a patient with AIDS who has fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and clinical findings suggestive of chronic enterocolitis, especially when routine stool studies fail to reveal a cause. Cytomegalovirus is by far the most common cause of opportunistic viral infection in patients with HIV disease.20 Well over 90 percent of homosexual patients with AIDS have serologic evidence of cytomegalovirus infection,21,22 and more than half shed the virus in semen or urine, as did this patient. The most important clinical disorders attributable to cytomegalovirus infection in the setting of HIV disease are retinitis, pneumonitis, and colitis.\\nVirtually any part of the gastrointestinal tract may be involved by cytomegalovirus infection, with esophagitis and colitis reported most commonly. In addition, cytomegalovirus has been implicated in a variety of other intraabdominal processes in patients with AIDS, including biliary obstruction, acalculous cholecystitis, and pancreatitis. Focal, segmental, or diffuse inflammatory involvement of the colon may occur, with a spectrum of severity ranging from minimal erythema and mucosal edema to a hemorrhagic pancolitis grossly indistinguishable from severe inflammatory bowel disease. The patients typically present with chronic, watery diarrhea, although frank dysentery and colonic perforation have been reported. The pathogenesis of bowel injury in cytomegalovirus colitis has been controversial, although most observers consider the injury to be secondary to a vasculitis precipitated by endothelial infection with this virus.23\\nThe patient under discussion was infected with cytomegalovirus, as indicated by the positive urine culture and by a retinitis that was attributable to cytomegalovirus, although that diagnosis is questionable in the light of the absence of retinal hemorrhage on serial examinations five months apart. Cytomegalovirus infection could account for his fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and colitis. However, in seeking a unifying diagnosis to explain also the pancytopenia and transfusion requirement, I am struck by the apparent downward displacement of the bowel seen on the abdominal film, which suggests bulky intraabdominal lymphadenopathy, as mentioned by Dr. Hahn. Although alternative explanations for the patient's pancytopenia, including marrow suppression by HIV Type 1 itself, are possible, the constellation of fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and possible bulky abdominal lymphadenopathy raises the question of a diffuse infiltrative process involving the reticuloendothelial system, such as lymphoma or disseminated fungal or mycobacterial infection.\\nDisseminated histoplasmosis is an important AIDS-defining illness in the United States, particularly in areas where histoplasmosis is endemic, such as the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys, where it accounts for 5 to 10 percent of HIV-related infections.24 Like tuberculosis and unlike infections caused by less virulent pathogens, such as P. carinii or M. avium complex, disseminated histoplasmosis often occurs early in the course of HIV disease,24 most frequently resulting from reactivation of a latent focus in the setting of waning immunity. Less commonly, primary exposure to inhaled spores leads directly to pneumonitis and disseminated disease, as it occasionally does in normal hosts. The patients typically present with a subacute illness, not unlike that of this patient, including fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia. Colonic involvement is occasionally seen in the setting of dissemination and may contribute to diarrhea and wasting. It usually takes the form of elevated mucosal plaques, polyps, or ulcers, most often in the proximal colon.25 However, a diffuse colitis associated with chronic diarrhea has been described rarely.25 Disseminated histoplasmosis is a possible diagnosis in this patient despite his taking ketoconazole. Ketoconazole has not proved effective in preventing relapses of this infection in the setting of advanced HIV disease.26 Unfortunately, we are not provided with any information regarding past exposure to this fungus. Massachusetts is not an area where histoplasmosis is endemic, but reactivation can occur years after a patient has left a region where it is endemic.27 Thus, I cannot rule out this diagnosis in the case under discussion.\\nThe two mycobacterial species of particular importance in the setting of HIV disease are M. tuberculosis and M. avium complex. The clinical manifestations of tuberculosis vary with the stage of the HIV disease, with widely disseminated infection typical of the advanced stages. In the Northeast, tuberculosis generally occurs in defined risk groups among patients with HIV disease, however — specifically, among urban minority groups, intravenous drug users, and immigrants from areas where tuberculosis is endemic.28-30 This patient belonged to none of these groups, and we are not told of any history of known exposure to tuberculosis. I shall therefore consider disseminated tuberculosis an improbable diagnosis in this case. I favor the diagnosis of disseminated M. avium complex infection. Since the organism is far less virulent than M. tuberculosis, its clinical manifestations become apparent only in the advanced stages of HIV disease, when the host is severely immunocompromised.\\nM. avium complex infection is detected at autopsy in more than 50 percent of patients who die with AIDS. This infection most commonly presents as a systemic illness, with fever, night sweats, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and weight loss to the point of emaciation. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain and tenderness, are common and are attributable to hepatosplenomegaly, intraabdominal lymphadenopathy, or intense infection of the bowel wall. In addition to upper tract involvement, enterocolitis associated with chronic diarrhea is well described.31 The bowel wall may be thickened, as is consistent with an inflammatory colitis.31-33 Concurrent infection with other enteric pathogens is frequent. Enterocolitis due to M. avium complex may elude a diagnosis if standard stool-culture techniques are used. The diagnosis may be suspected on the basis of a positive acid-fast smear of stool and confirmed by biopsy. Mycobacteremia in this setting has been noted in up to 85 percent of patients with disseminated infection but may be missed unless blood cultures are held for a sufficient time or lysis-centrifugation techniques are used.32 This patient's blood cultures were negative, but the method of culture is not specified.\\nIn summary, the best unifying diagnosis to explain the constellation of findings in his subacute illness is disseminated M. avium complex infection, with infiltration of the liver, spleen, abdominal lymph nodes, bone marrow, and colon.\\nTo explain the acute pulmonary and pleuropericardial process that led to the patient's death, I shall first discuss whether any of the diagnoses considered for his subacute illness could also account for his acute deterioration. I shall then raise additional diagnostic possibilities, since multiple concurrent diagnoses are the rule in the setting of HIV disease.\\nBoth lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma may involve the lungs in patients with HIV disease and can cause respiratory compromise.33 Thoracic involvement occurs in 4.3 to 31 percent of patients with AIDS-associated lymphoma.34 The radiographic appearance of pulmonary involvement includes interstitial and alveolar disease, nodules, pleural effusions with or without associated parenchymal disease, and rarely hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.33,35 In addition, both myocardial and pericardial involvement by lymphoma has been reported.35,36\\nPulmonary involvement with Kaposi's sarcoma is responsible for about a third of episodes of respiratory tract disease requiring evaluation in patients with AIDS who have a history of this tumor.33,37 There is autopsy evidence of pulmonary involvement in about 50 percent of those with systemic disease.38 Pulmonary involvement usually follows cutaneous manifestations, but like other types of visceral involvement it may occur as the sole or initial manifestation of this tumor. In contrast to patients with Kaposi's sarcoma at other visceral sites, however, patients with pulmonary involvement usually have symptoms and may die as a direct result of this disease. The symptoms include fever, dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and chest pain. Wheezing may occur as a result of submucosal bronchial nodules. There is a spectrum of radiographic presentations, with diffuse interstitial or nodular infiltrates seen most often,33,37,39 and segmental or lobar infiltrates are less common. Both thoracic lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions are seen frequently. In addition, myocardial, epicardial, and pericardial involvement by this tumor is well documented, and pericardial effusion with tamponade has been reported in this setting.40\\nSeveral points are against the diagnosis of either lymphoma or Kaposi's sarcoma as the primary cause of this patient's acute deterioration, however. Most important is the rapid pace of the pulmonary disease that contributed to his death. Pulmonary involvement by these tumors typically gives rise to increasing symptoms with a subacute onset and slow progression over weeks to months. Pyogenic or opportunistic infections are often superimposed on the underlying disease and contribute to acute respiratory compromise. The x-ray film of the chest obtained three months before admission was normal, and there were no respiratory problems even at the time of admission. Over the ensuing hours severe respiratory distress developed, with both diffuse and focal pulmonary infiltrates associated with a left pleural effusion and possible pericardial tamponade. Although I cannot dismiss the possibility of intrathoracic involvement by either of these tumors, the rapid progression of the pulmonary infiltrates strongly favors either a superimposed or an independent process, most likely infectious, as the primary cause of his death.\\nPulmonary involvement with cytomegalovirus infection is very common among persons with HIV disease. This virus has been found either by culture or by characteristic cytopathic changes in 17 to 34 percent of bronchoscopic specimens from patients with AIDS-related pulmonary abnormalities¹¹ and an even larger proportion of the patients at autopsy. However, the pathogenic importance of cytomegalovirus as a pulmonary pathogen in the setting of HIV disease is controversial.42 When one looks critically into the literature, one can find but a handful of reported cases in which a clinical syndrome of dyspnea, hypoxia, and diffuse infiltrates has been found to correlate with histopathological evidence of pulmonary cytomegalovirus infection in the absence of other pathogens, such as P. carinii. Nonetheless, these few cases confirm that cytomegalovirus alone can cause a diffuse pneumonitis in patients with AIDS, albeit rarely. Several features of this patient's presentation weigh against cytomegalovirus infection, however. Cytomegalovirus pneumonia presents radiographically as a diffuse interstitial pneumonia.43 The focal and asymmetric alveolar infiltrate with the nodular component noted in this patient would be very atypical for cytomegalovirus infection, as would the pleural effusion. Pericarditis attributed to cytomegalovirus, including a case in a patient with AIDS complicated by cardiac tamponade, has been reported but is exceedingly rare. Thus, the radiologic findings are against that diagnosis in this case.\\nWhat about disseminated histoplasmosis? Pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnea, are observed in only a minority of the patients with this disease and are usually subacute in onset.24 Radiographic evidence of disease is present in a little over half the patients, with diffuse interstitial or reticulonodular infiltrates most commonly seen. Pleural effusions are rare. Pericarditis with tamponade due to histoplasmosis in the setting of HIV disease has not been reported to my knowledge, although it is seen rarely in normal hosts, in whom it results from rupture of a caseous focus into the pericardial space.45 Although uncommon, acute pulmonary insufficiency in patients with AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis can be seen in three settings. In the first, secondary pneumonias due to pyogenic or opportunistic organisms develop. Secondly, inhalation of a large inoculum of arthroconidia gives rise to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, as it can in normal hosts. Finally, in 7 to 11 percent of cases the subacute manifestations of diffuse histoplasmosis culminate in a clinical presentation resembling that of gram-negative septicemia, characterized by a high fever, hypotension, coagulopathy, multiorgan failure, and death, with radiographic findings resembling those of the adult respiratory distress syndrome.46 Recent inhalation exposure to Histoplasma capsulatum would not be expected in this patient unless he had encountered an infectious aerosol during his recent trip to the Caribbean, where this fungus is endemic. The x-ray films of the chest did not show the diffuse alveolar pattern of the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Thus, this patient's acute pleuropulmonary presentation would be atypical of histoplasmosis and especially so of dissemination secondary to reactivation in a person living where the infection is not endemic.\\nM. avium complex infection has been associated with a variety of radiographic manifestations, including diffuse bilateral infiltrates, focal consolidation, pleural effusion, and hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. However, respiratory symptoms are usually unimportant, and x-ray films of the chest are often normal even when the organisms can be cultured from the respiratory tract secretions. In an autopsy review of 68 patients who died with AIDS, 32 were found to have postmortem evidence of M. avium complex infection.47 In all the cases of pulmonary involvement with M. avium complex, pathologic changes that could be attributed to this infection were minimal or absent. Thus, the fulminant pulmonary and pleuropericardial manifestations of this patient's acute disease are at odds with the limited potential of M. avium complex as a pulmonary pathogen in the setting of AIDS.\\nTherefore, none of the potential causes of this patient's subacute illness readily account for his acute illness, and a second pathogen is probable as the immediate cause of death. Among the viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic agents causing acute pulmonary disease in patients with AIDS I must find one that could account for the radiographic pattern of diffuse interstitial and focal air-space disease with a nodular component, along with pleural effusion, possible hilar lymphadenopathy, and possible pericardial involvement.\\nPyogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and less commonly Staphylococcus aureus, are community-acquired pathogens that must not be overlooked in the workup of patients with AIDS who have pneumonia. Such infections in HIV-infected patients are associated with an increased frequency of multilobar involvement and bacteremia.8 Against the diagnosis of a pyogenic process in the patient under discussion are the absence of a cough productive of purulent sputum and the x-ray findings, which would be atypical for pyogenic pneumonia. Among other bacteria, legionella species may cause diffuse pneumonia in patients with HIV disease, although recent reports49 indicate that legionella infection is rare among patients with HIV disease. Nodular infiltrates and extensive pleuropericardial involvement would be atypical of infection due to legionella. Conversely, nodular infiltrates and pleural effusions are not uncommon with pulmonary nocardiosis, which is occasionally seen in patients with HIV disease. However, nocardia infections typically run a more subacute course, with cavitation common.50\\nP. carinii is the most common cause of pulmonary disease in patients with HIV disease and therefore must be high in the differential diagnosis in any such patient presenting with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.43 However, pneumocystis pneumonia tends to be subacute in the setting of AIDS, with progressive respiratory deterioration over a course of weeks. Pleural effusions are uncommon, and the asymmetric pulmonary involvement noted on the x-ray films of the chest in this case would be distinctly atypical.51 Finally, pericardial disease directly related to P. carinii infection has not been reported.\\nToxoplasmosis, which usually presents as encephalitis in the setting of HIV disease, is recognized as a cause of pneumonia,52-54 although lung involvement remains uncommon even in areas where this infection is hyperendemic. Patients with AIDS who have pulmonary toxoplasmosis present with fever, dyspnea, and diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates mimicking pneumocystis pneumonia, but often with a more rapid onset. In some patients multiple nodular densities are seen in addition to diffuse involvement. The patients may present with acute respiratory failure along with a hemodynamic pattern of septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Both myocardial involvement and pericardial involvement are reported among patients with AIDS.55-57 However, pleural effusions have not been noted.52,54 The rarity of a pulmonary presentation of this infection and the prominence of pleural involvement in this patient weigh against this diagnosis, although it remains a possibility.\\nA final diagnostic consideration, which fits best the clinical and radiographic picture of this patient's acute illness, is disseminated cryptococcosis, with pulmonary, pleural, pericardial, and muscle involvement. Cryptococcosis is the fourth most common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV disease, reported in 6 and 13.3 percent of those in two recent series of cases.58,59 The most common presentation is that of a meningoencephalitis, usually as part of a disseminated infection, but pulmonary presentations with either an insidious or an acute onset are being increasingly recognized. Among the fungi causing pneumonia in the setting of HIV disease, Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common.60 In Africa pulmonary cryptococcosis is frequently seen among patients with HIV infection.61 Several radiographic presentations have been described, including unilateral or bilateral alveolar or interstitial infiltrates, or both, single or multiple nodules with or without cavitation, a miliary pattern, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusions. Rarely, patients have presented with diffuse alveolar infiltrates clinically indistinguishable from those of the adult respiratory distress syndrome.62 Cryptococcal pericarditis59,63 and myocarditis64,65 have both been reported in the setting of HIV disease. Disseminated cryptococcal infection could account for the patient's diffuse muscle tenderness with elevated serum enzyme levels, and pyelonephritis secondary to C. neoformans could have contributed to his renal insufficiency, which is otherwise best explained by volume contraction in the setting of chronic diarrhea and poor oral intake.66\\nThe diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis is made by isolating the organism from respiratory tract secretions, pleural fluid, or a biopsy specimen of lung tissue. Blood and urine cultures may be positive, and serum cryptococcal antigen is detected in 75 to 99 percent of HIV-infected patients with disseminated disease. C. neoformans has been found in a variety of extraneural and extrapulmonary sites, including the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and prostate gland, although it only occasionally compromises organ function.31 Colitis due to C. neoformans has not been reported. Thus, whereas cryptococcal pneumonia with pleuropericardial involvement fits this patient's acute presentation, it would not account for the subacute wasting illness during the three months before his death.\\nIn summary, I believe that the most probable cause of this patient's subacute illness was a diffusely infiltrative process involving both the reticuloendothelial system and the colon, with disseminated M. avium complex infection as the best unifying diagnosis. The acute process leading directly to death is not well explained by this diagnosis, however, suggesting that a second process supervened. The pace of events implicates an infectious agent, of which either toxoplasma or cryptococcus is most likely, but I believe that the pathogen that best fits the clinical and radiographic findings is C. neoformans.\\nDR. ROBERT E. SCULLY: Dr. Pineda, will you tell us your clinical impression?\\nDr. Allan E. PINEDA: On admission the patient was profoundly dehydrated. Initially, he did not have any respiratory tract symptoms, which became manifest over the ensuing 12 hours. As his respiratory status deteriorated, with volume resuscitation, we became very concerned that he had myocarditis and also considered the possibility of pericardial tamponade. At that point his clinical condition deteriorated very rapidly, and he died before we could institute supportive measures.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nMyocarditis complicated by pulmonary edema and pericardial tamponade.\\n\\nDR. PAUL F. KAMITSUKA'S DIAGNOSES\\nDisseminated cryptococcosis, with pulmonary, pleural, pericardial, and muscle involvement.\\nDisseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. JAMES F. SOUTHERN: An autopsy was limited to the chest and abdomen. One liter of fluid was present in each pleural cavity, 200 ml in the pericardial sac, and a small amount in the peritoneal cavity. The lungs were massively edematous. Small pale, firm areas were scattered throughout the lungs.\\nThe heart was grossly dilated; the diameter of the left ventricular chamber was greater than 6 cm. The myocardium had multiple punctate hemorrhages. Microscopical examination revealed scattered areas of dropout of myocytes with an inflammatory infiltrate consisting of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Fig. 3). Occasional contraction bands were seen adjacent to these areas. Cysts containing multiple small spores were present within myocytes away from the areas of obvious necrosis and inflammation. The spores were positive for periodic acid-Schiff and were diastase-resistant (Fig. 4) — i.e., characteristic of Toxoplasma gondii, but not of Trypanosoma cruzi, a cause of cardiac infection among persons in the American Southwest and Central and South America. The diagnosis, therefore, was severe, diffuse toxoplasma myocarditis. Toxoplasma also involved the muscularis of the colon, with extensive destruction of the muscularis propria (Fig. 5), which probably affected motility. In addition, there was cytomegalovirus colitis, with mucosal ulceration. The liver and spleen were massively congested as a result of cardiac failure due to the myocarditis. We did not find evidence of infection by fungi or by M. avium complex.\\nDR. PINEDA: Toxoplasma myocarditis is very rare in the absence of involvement of the central nervous system. We were not allowed to examine the patient's brain at autopsy, but a spinal tap and a CT scan of the head were negative. The retinitis had the appearance of an inflammation due to cytomegalovirus rather than to toxoplasmosis.\\nDR. HAHN: Was there evidence of lymphadenopathy either in the chest or in the abdomen at autopsy?\\nDR. SOUTHERN: There was lymphadenopathy, but there was no specific disease in the lymph nodes examined microscopically.\",\n",

One month before admission he\\ncame to the emergency department, where physical\\nexamination showed a left supraglottic mass and ir-\\nregularity of the right vocal cord; no cervical lym-\\nphadenopathy was found. Arrangements were made\\nfor his urgent admission to the hospital, but he did not\\narrive until he was brought in by a friend one month\\nlater.\\nThe patient was single and worked irregularly at\\nodd jobs, most recently carpentry. He had smoked\\ntwo packs of cigarettes daily since the age of 16 years\\nand discontinued the habit two weeks before admis-\\nsion. Since the age of 22 years he had consumed large\\namounts of liquor daily. He periodically stopped\\ndrinking and experienced shakes and a sensation\\nof warmth for a day or two thereafter; he was not\\naware of chills or fever at other times. The patient\\nwas a high-school dropout who had attended a course\\nin electronics and had driven a tractor-trailer, but\\nhe disliked both types of work. He was treated with\\nmedications for depression during a 1-year interval\\nthat began 11 years before admission; he admitted\\nhaving had symptoms of depression in recent years\\nFigure 1.

Ten to 15 years\\nbefore admission he had had contact with prostitutes\\nand had been treated for gonorrhea. In recent years\\nhe often met with drinking companions who resided\\nin shelters for the homeless. The patient\\'s father\\nwas a chronic alcoholic and homeless and stayed inter-\\nmittently with his son. A sister was a chronic alco-\\nholic; three other siblings were believed to be alive\\nand well but were estranged from the patient. His\\nmother had died of lung cancer. There was no history\\nof odynophagia, dysphagia, homosexual activity, in-\\ntravenous drug abuse, receipt of blood products,\\ncough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, wheeze, weight loss, al-\\nlergy to medications, or recent travel outside eastern\\nMassachusetts.\\nThe temperature was 37.6°C, the pulse was 76, and\\nthe respirations were 24. The blood pressure was\\n130/90 mm Hg.\\nOn physical examination the patient was thin\\nand articulate but hoarse. No lymphadenopathy was\\nfound. The head, neck, lungs, heart, abdomen, and\\nextremities were normal, and neurologic examination\\nwas negative.\\nThe urine was normal. The results of hematologic\\nlaboratory tests are presented in Table 1. The levels of\\nurea nitrogen, creatinine, protein (albumin and globu-\\nlin), electrolytes, calcium, glucose, bilirubin, lactate\\ndehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase were nor-\\nmal; the concentration of aspartate aminotransferase\\nwas 48 U per liter (normal range, 9 to 25). An electro-\\ncardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 58,\\nwith partial right-bundle-branch block, and was oth-\\nerwise normal. Tests for hepatitis B core antibody and\\nhepatitis C antibody were positive; tests for hepatitis A\\nantibody and hepatitis B surface antibody were nega-\\ntive. Radiographs of the chest (Fig. 1) revealed bi-\\nlateral reticulonodular opacities in the upper lobes\\nand hyperexpansion of the lower lobes; no mediastinal\\nlymphadenopathy was observed; the heart and bony\\nthorax appeared normal.

RENÉE M. ROSSI*: This case involves the differ-\\nential diagnosis of a granular exophytic mass of the\\nlarynx in a 38-year-old man with a history of tobacco\\nand alcohol abuse, hepatitis, and gonorrhea. The re-\\nsults of laboratory studies were normal except for a\\nslightly elevated aminotransferase level, a positive test\\nfor hepatitis B core antibody, and a negative test for\\nhepatitis B surface antibody — findings consistent\\nwith the carrier state — and a positive test for hepati-\\ntis C antibody. One month before admission the pa-\\ntient was seen in the emergency department for a left\\nsupraglottic mass and irregularity of the right vocal\\ncord. He had a social history of contact with prosti-\\ntutes 10 to 15 years before presentation and more re-\\ncent meetings with alcoholics who resided in homeless\\nshelters as well as irregular periods of housing his\\nalcoholic, homeless father.\\nMay we review the radiographic findings?\\nDR. JO-ANNE O. SHEPARD: Posteroanterior and lat-\\neral radiographs of the chest demonstrate bilateral\\nupper-lobe reticulonodular opacities, with associated\\nvolume loss in the upper lobes and bilateral cephalad\\nretraction of the hilus (Fig. 1), and minimal right api-\\ncal pleural thickening. There is no evidence of medi-\\nastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, the heart size is\\nnormal, and no pleural effusions are evident. A coned-\\ndown view of the upper airway (Fig. 2) reveals mini-\\nmal prominence in the immediate subglottic region on\\nthe left side.\\nDR. ROSSI: The causes of granular exophytic lesions\\nof the larynx include benign and malignant neoplasms\\nas well as idiopathic granulomatous diseases and in-\\nfectious processes. The differential diagnosis of inter-\\nstitial lesions of the lungs predominantly in the upper\\nzone includes granulomatous infections, sarcoidosis,\\ncystic fibrosis, eosinophilic granuloma (histiocytosis\\nX), and silicosis.¹ Disorders that might account for\\nboth the laryngeal and the pulmonary findings in this\\npatient are granulomatous infections such as tubercu-\\nlosis and mycoses, sarcoidosis, and Wegener\\'s granu-\\nlomatosis. Although the patient denied receipt of\\nblood products, intravenous drug abuse, and homo-\\nsexual activity, there is a high index of suspicion\\nfor the possibility of human immunodeficiency virus\\n(HIV) infection in view of the serologic findings indi-\\ncating hepatitis B and C and the social history.

Cystic fibrosis would have presented\\nmuch earlier in life, and the upper respiratory tract\\nlesions usually involve the paranasal sinuses. The ra-\\ndiologic findings are typical of eosinophilic granulo-\\nma; however, the findings in the head and neck in that\\ndisorder are usually limited to the temporal bone and\\nskull, and I am unaware of any reported cases of eo-\\nsinophilic granuloma of the larynx.2 Furthermore, pa-\\ntients with that disorder usually present at an earlier\\nage. The lack of exposure rules out the diagnosis of\\nsilicosis or berylliosis.\\nBenign laryngeal tumors mimicking the appearance\\nof the lesion in this patient include papilloma, granu-\\nlar-cell tumor, polypoid granulation tissue, and con-\\ntact granuloma.\\nLaryngeal papilloma is the most common benign\\nlaryngeal lesion, occurring in either a juvenile-onset\\nform or an adult-onset form. The juvenile form ap-\\npears in infancy or early childhood, is more aggressive,\\nfrequently involves the trachea, is often refractory to\\ntreatment, and leaves the patient with chronic hoarse-\\nness. Pulmonary parenchymal involvement is infre-\\nquent and is usually associated with aggressive juve-\\nnile-onset papillomatosis. The lesions in both the\\njuvenile and the adult forms of the disease are typical-\\nly exophytic and located on the anterior true vocal\\ncords, the false cords, and the epiglottis. Human pap-\\nillomavirus types 6 and 11 have been implicated in the\\nformation of laryngeal papillomas. Laryngeal papillo-\\nmatosis is ruled out because of the patient\\'s low-grade\\nfever, tachypnea, and pulmonary findings.\\nGranular-cell tumors are rare in the larynx and are\\nassociated with slowly progressive hoarseness. Most\\nof them appear as sessile or polypoid nodules, which\\nare rarely ulcerated, although some are described as\\nwarty or granular. Histologic examination reveals\\npolyhedral cells with acidophilic, granular cytoplasm;\\npseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia is often noted and\\nis sometimes mistaken for squamous-cell carcinoma.2\\nThe most common site is the posterior true cord, but\\nthese tumors also occur in the subglottic and supra-\\nglottic regions. They are isolated, without systemic\\nmanifestations, and thus are unlikely in the patient\\nunder discussion.\\nPolypoid granulation tissue is the most common\\nvascular mass found in the larynx and is usually the\\nresult of trauma (e.g., biopsy, intubation, or a pene-\\ntrating wound). The absence of antecedent trauma or\\nintubation rules out this lesion in the case under dis-\\ncussion.\\nContact granulomas are usually the result of vocal\\nabuse, but gastroesophageal reflux into the posterior\\nlarynx has been strongly implicated as a contributing\\nfactor.5 Inflammation occurs in the posterior larynx in\\nthe region of the vocal process of the arytenoid carti-\\nlage. The appearance is that of either an ulcer or\\nheaped-up granulation tissue. The extensive involve-\\nment of the supraglottic larynx eliminates the diagno-\\nsis of a contact granuloma in this patient.\\nSquamous-cell carcinoma is the most common neo-\\nplasm of the larynx, and the true vocal cord is the\\nmost common site. It is a disease seen principally in\\nmiddle-aged men, with a peak frequency in the sixth\\nor seventh decade, and cigarette use has been impli-\\ncated repeatedly in its genesis. Smokers (with 25 to 50\\npack-years or more of smoking) are at 7 to 15 times\\ngreater risk of laryngeal carcinoma than nonsmokers.6\\nSmoking and alcohol consumption are synergistic fac-\\ntors in the development of laryngeal carcinoma. The\\ngross appearance is usually that of a fungating mass,\\npink to gray-white, often with central ulceration.2\\nStaging is based on the preoperative appearance of the\\ntumor, involvement of adjacent laryngeal areas, and\\nvocal-cord mobility. On the basis of the staging crite-\\nria of the American Joint Committee on Cancer, the\\nlesion in this patient would be stage II (T2N0M0)\\n(involving two sites of the larynx with no metastases).\\nSquamous-cell carcinoma of the larynx is uncommon\\nbefore the age of 40 years, since the effects of tobacco\\nare cumulative, and the peak morbidity is usually in\\nthe sixth or seventh decade. In general, young pa-\\ntients with these tumors present with more advanced\\ndisease than older patients, with a decreased survival.\\nLikewise, they are at substantial risk for the develop-\\nment of a second primary tumor after treatment of the\\nfirst tumor.8\\nGlottic carcinoma tends to remain localized because\\nof the paucity of lymphatics in the region. Regional\\ncervical lymph nodes are the first site of metastasis,\\nand pulmonary metastases are unusual. Although su-\\npraglottic carcinoma tends to be associated with bi-\\nlateral cervical lymph-node metastases, pulmonary in-\\nvolvement is unlikely in their absence. Metastatic\\nsquamous-cell carcinoma in the lung has a peripheral\\nnodular appearance and not the reticulonodular ap-\\npearance seen on the radiographs of the chest in\\nthis case. Squamous-cell carcinoma of the larynx\\ncould have been ruled out by direct laryngoscopic ex-\\namination and biopsy. Keratinizing squamous-cell\\ncarcinoma accounts for 99 percent of carcinomas of\\nthe larynx, with the remaining 1 percent consisting of\\noat-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous\\ncarcinoma, and verrucous carcinoma.2\\nBoth patients with Wegener\\'s granulomatosis and\\nthose with sarcoidosis characteristically have pulmo-\\nnary involvement at presentation. Wegener\\'s granulo-\\nmatosis typically presents with sinusitis, pulmonary\\ninfiltrates, and glomerulonephritis. In the rare cases in\\nwhich it is confined to the trachea and larynx, it is\\ndifficult to diagnose, since biopsies of this region sel-\\ndom demonstrate vasculitis. In the eight cases of pri-\\nmary tracheolaryngeal Wegener\\'s granulomatosis re-\\nported in the literature, the disease was confined to the\\nsubglottis in seven cases and to the vocal cords and\\nsubglottis in the remaining case. Late manifestations\\nof the disease developed in six of the eight patients. In\\nthe patients with multisystem involvement, including\\nthe larynx, the subglottis was the most commonly af-\\nfected site. The gross appearance is that of an ery-\\nthematous, boggy, or ulcerated mucosa, with prolif-\\neration of granulation tissue.

The\\nabsence of subglottic disease, renal disease, and sinus\\ninvolvement is evidence against the diagnosis of Weg-\\nener\\'s granulomatosis in this case.\\nThe larynx is involved in 5 percent of cases of sar-\\ncoidosis, and the lesions are most common in the su-\\npraglottic larynx. 10,11 The disease affects areas of the\\nlarynx rich in lymphatics and thus characteristically\\nspares the true vocal cords. In most reported cases the\\nlesions appeared on the posterior epiglottis, aryepi-\\nglottic folds, false cords, or arytenoid region as submu-\\ncosal brownish nodules sometimes surrounded by a\\nzone of erythema; the nodules can fuse and give rise to\\nsevere thickening of the supraglottic region. 12 Patients\\nwith laryngeal sarcoidosis usually present with airway\\nobstruction as a primary manifestation, since ulcer-\\nation does not occur. Because of the rarity of vocal-\\ncord involvement, hoarseness is an unusual manifesta-\\ntion. 13 The radiographic appearance of stage I disease\\nis bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, with normal pe-\\nripheral lung fields, but 25 percent of the patients\\npresent with stage II disease, with pulmonary paren-\\nchymal involvement and hilar lymphadenopathy. The\\nparenchymal involvement consists of small nodules or\\nreticulonodular infiltrates scattered diffusely through-\\nout both lungs. Multisystem involvement is frequent.\\nBiopsies show nonspecific noncaseating granulomas,\\nand one must rule out fungal and bacterial diseases,\\nhypersensitivity reactions, and beryllium inhalation\\nbefore making the diagnosis. The cardiac conduction\\nsystem can be affected by sarcoidosis, and right-bun-\\ndle-branch block is the most common conduction ab-\\nnormality. However, idiopathic right-bundle-branch\\nblock is much more common than sarcoid-induced\\nright-bundle-branch block. The presence of a low-\\ngrade fever and vocal-cord involvement is inconsistent\\nwith sarcoidosis in this case.\\nIn the absence of an elevated white-cell count or\\nother upper respiratory tract findings, an acute bac-\\nterial infection is unlikely. Among the chronic in-\\nfectious diseases that are most consistent with the\\nprolonged history of hoarseness, tachypnea, and low-\\ngrade fever and the findings on the radiographs of the\\nchest, tertiary syphilis is characterized by a long histo-\\nry of chronic laryngitis manifested by mucosal edema\\nand chondritis, producing arytenoid fixation and sub-\\nglottic stenosis. 14 The history of gonorrhea suggests\\nthe possibility of syphilis, but the coexistence of the\\npulmonary infiltrates and the absence of central nerv-\\nous system involvement are evidence against that di-\\nagnosis.\\nFungal infections that are acquired principally by\\ninhalation and spread by lymphohematogenous dis-\\nsemination are referred to as systemic mycoses and\\ninclude blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococ-\\ncosis, histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, and mucormyco-\\nsis. The organisms causing these infections are not\\ntransmissible from human to human; the diseases are\\nacquired by inhalation of spores, which typically\\nresults in asymptomatic or mild pulmonary infections\\nthat heal spontaneously. 15 Progressive pulmonary in-\\nfection and spread to extrapulmonary sites are infre-\\nquent except in the immunocompromised host. Since\\nthere is no documented history of travel to areas\\nwhere coccidioidomycosis or paracoccidioidomycosis\\nis endemic, these mycoses can be eliminated from con-\\nsideration.\\nFungal disease of the larynx is uncommon, and the\\npathogens are almost exclusively the yeasts; therefore,\\nthe molds aspergillus and mucor can be ruled out. 16\\nCulture and biopsy are the mainstay of the diagno-\\nsis of mycoses, although serial complement-fixation\\ntiters may be useful. Skin testing with fungal anti-\\ngens is unreliable, especially in the areas where the\\nfungal diseases are endemic. The fungal diseases that\\nare most likely to involve both the larynx and the\\nlungs are histoplasmosis and blastomycosis. There\\nare a few isolated reports of primary histoplasmosis\\nof the larynx, but laryngeal involvement is generally\\na manifestation of progressive disseminated disease.\\nDisseminated histoplasmosis occurs most often in im-\\nmunocompromised patients, including malnourished,\\nchronically debilitated patients and those with the\\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). 16 Im-\\nmunocompromised patients are not, however, at\\nincreased risk for disseminated blastomycosis. Dis-\\nseminated histoplasmosis, which may present as an\\nunrelenting, fulminant disease or as a low-grade infec-\\ntion spanning many years, often with long asymp-\\ntomatic periods, is characterized by febrile episodes\\nand a tendency toward the development of oro-\\npharyngeal and laryngeal ulcers. The systemic find-\\nings in patients with chronic disseminated histoplas-\\nmosis include fever, chills, malaise, and weight loss.\\nInterstitial pneumonitis consistent with the hematog-\\nenous spread of infection and associated with early\\ndisease, calcified granulomas, or cavities, or a com-\\nbination of these features, can be found. Overall,\\ntwo thirds of patients with disseminated histoplasmo-\\nsis have laryngeal or oropharyngeal ulcers, or both,\\nwhich are often the presenting manifestations. The\\nlaryngeal lesions may cause vocal-cord fixation, and\\nthe lesions can involve any area of the larynx. On\\nmicroscopical examination tuberculoid granulomas\\nmay be observed, or pseudoepitheliomatous hyper-\\nplasia may be seen and confused with squamous-\\ncell carcinoma. 17 Blastomycosis was found to involve\\nthe larynx in 2 percent of the cases in a composite\\nstudy. 15 Laryngeal lesions are described as erythema-\\ntous, granular masses with irregular borders, similar\\nto those seen with histoplasmosis.\\nA chronic disseminated mycotic infection, such as\\nhistoplasmosis or blastomycosis, is a possibility in this\\ncase. Histoplasmosis is endemic in river basins, par-\\nticularly those of the Ohio, Mississippi, and St. Law-\\nrence rivers, and the patient had no history of travel to\\nthose areas. If the patient was HIV-negative, as I\\nassume, and was not immunocompromised, the prob-\\nability of disseminated histoplasmosis is low.

The blastomyces multiply best in damp areas\\nwhere decaying wood and moisture are present. The\\ndisease has a higher prevalence among men and is\\nmore common in sportsmen who frequent wooded\\nareas and areas along streams. In this case the absence\\nof exposure, again, probably rules out blastomycosis\\nas a diagnostic consideration.\\nTuberculosis is one of the most common causes of\\ngranulomatous disease of the larynx. 18,19 In the past,\\nlaryngeal involvement was associated with severe\\ncavitary disease of the lung and was the result of in-\\nfected sputum contacting the larynx. Recently, there\\nhas been an increase in tuberculosis with the AIDS\\nepidemic, and it often occurs early in the course of\\nHIV infection as a sentinel opportunistic infection. 20\\nSome authors of recent literature on laryngeal tuber-\\nculosis implicate lymphohematogenous spread as the\\nsource. 18,19,21-23 The patient under discussion presum-\\nably underwent HIV testing, and if it was negative I\\nassume that skin testing with purified protein deriva-\\ntive and appropriate controls was carried out and spu-\\ntum cultures were obtained. The patient was a chronic\\ncarrier of hepatitis B, since he had a positive test for\\nhepatitis B core antibody and a negative test for hepa-\\ntitis B surface antibody, and he had a positive test for\\nhepatitis C antibody and a history of substantial expo-\\nsure to prostitutes and gonorrhea. It is possible that he\\nhad contracted AIDS and that the gonorrhea was his\\nfirst opportunistic infection. There is also the possibil-\\nity that he continued to have contact with prostitutes\\nor that he used intravenous drugs, or both, putting\\nhim in a high-risk category for HIV infection. The\\ndiagnosis of tuberculosis as a presenting feature\\nof HIV infection must be strongly entertained. If\\na patient is HIV-positive, anergy is likely and skin\\ntesting is not helpful. Reactivation of \"dormant tuber-\\nculosis\" is the most likely cause of tuberculosis\\nin HIV-positive people.¹ In addition, there is a strik-\\ning association of alcoholism with tuberculosis and\\nespecially pulmonary infection. Studies from many\\ncountries have demonstrated a substantially great-\\ner frequency of pulmonary tuberculosis among alco-\\nholics than among nonalcoholics. 24 The authors of\\na study in Minneapolis found that the rate of new\\ncases of active pulmonary tuberculosis among home-\\nless men was 22.2 per 1000, as compared with 0.4 per\\n1000 in the general population (a 55.5-fold increase).25\\nThe patient\\'s history of alcoholism, probable mal-\\nnutrition, and association with multiple homeless peo-\\nple certainly increased the risk of his acquiring tuber-\\nculosis.\\nRecent reports of tuberculosis of the larynx indi-\\ncate that hoarseness is the most frequent presenting\\nsymptom 18,19,21-23; dysphagia and odynophagia are less\\ncommon. In contrast to the findings in the older lit-\\nerature, the lesions described recently have shown no\\npredilection for posterior laryngeal involvement; most\\nof the patients have had anterior vocal-cord involve-\\nment, and hypertrophic lesions were more common\\nthan ulcerative ones. Pulmonary involvement often\\nconsisted of apical cavitation and apical infiltration.\\nTravis et al. 26 stated that the mode of infection in true\\nvocal cords is through infected sputum, whereas ad-\\nditional involvement of the false cords, epiglottis,\\nand aryepiglottic folds suggests a hematogenous route,\\nas seen in this case. Spread by the bloodstream can\\noccur in patients with primary laryngeal tuberculosis,\\nmiliary tuberculosis, or even minimal pulmonary in-\\nvolvement. It is thought that pulmonary tuberculosis\\nis the source in nearly all cases of laryngeal tubercu-\\nlosis and that cases of primary and hematogenous\\nlaryngeal tuberculosis are rare.27 Direct laryngoscopic\\nexamination with biopsy provides the most conclusive\\nevidence for tuberculosis and presumably was the di-\\nagnostic procedure performed in this case. Tissue\\nand sputum cultures are also mandatory. The la-\\nryngeal lesions of tuberculosis are noted to respond\\nto antituberculous regimens within weeks. Vocal-\\ncord immobility due to fibrosis may produce per-\\nmanent hoarseness. Current treatment for disseminat-\\ned disease initially includes a four-drug regimen of\\nisoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol,\\nuntil susceptibility tests are performed; if the or-\\nganism is susceptible to the other drugs, ethambutol\\ncan be discontinued. 28 A fifth drug, streptomycin\\nor amikacin, is added for suspected drug-resistant\\nstrains.\\nMy diagnosis is laryngeal tuberculosis, with hema-\\ntogenous spread to or from the lungs, with a high\\nindex of suspicion for HIV disease.\\nDR. MAX L. GOODMAN: Dr. Sizeland, will you com-\\nment about your clinical impression?\\nDR. ANDREW M. SizeLand: Our initial impression\\nbefore we had the radiologic findings was that carcino-\\nma was the most likely diagnosis. However, once we\\nhad the radiologic findings in the chest it became ob-\\nvious that this was not the whole story. Furthermore,\\nwe were suspicious of that diagnosis from the start\\nin view of the young age of the patient and raised\\nthe question of laryngeal tuberculosis. The only oth-\\ner diagnosis that I thought about at that time, which\\nwas not mentioned in the discussion, was laryngeal\\ncarcinoid. However, that disorder usually presents\\nas a granular supraglottic mass and was not a likely\\ndiagnosis because of the pulmonary findings.

No fungi were identified.\\nBefore antituberculous therapy was available, la-\\nryngeal manifestations of the disease were frequent\\nand were almost always accompanied by advanced\\ncavitary pulmonary lesions. 29 In 1905 an autopsy\\nstudy of patients who had died of tuberculosis found\\nlaryngeal involvement in 48 percent, 30 and in 1946 a\\nsimilar study found such involvement in 37 percent of\\npatients. 31 The laryngeal lesions tended to be posteri-\\nor, multiple, and ulcerative. 32 The posterior location\\nwas presumably the result of prolonged bed rest,\\nwhich caused infectious pulmonary secretions to pool\\nposteriorly. 32 Even before the advent of modern anti-\\ntuberculous therapy, laryngeal tuberculosis was be-\\ncoming less common and declining more rapidly than\\ntuberculosis as a whole, 33 probably as a result of earli-\\ner diagnosis and better treatment of the pulmonary\\ndisease. 34\\nStudies during the era of modern therapy and,\\nin particular, the past 15 years have shown even\\ngreater changes in the nature of laryngeal tubercu-\\nlosis. 18,19,22,32,35-39 Although pulmonary disease and\\nsymptoms still preceded the laryngeal lesions in up to\\n80 percent of the cases, 18 advanced pulmonary disease\\nwith major cavitary lesions was relatively rare. 32,38\\nThe location of the laryngeal lesions has changed con-\\nsiderably from the posterior involvement in the earlier\\nera. In most of the recent studies the true cords were\\ninvolved in over half the cases, with variable supra-\\nglottic, subglottic, and posterior extension. 18,19,22,32,38\\nOccasionally, there was isolated involvement of the\\nepiglottic, supraglottic, or subglottic regions. 38 In\\none large study, regardless of location, the lesions\\nwere solitary four times more often than multiple. 32\\nThe authors of some studies noted that ulceration was\\nuncommon. 22,37 The gross appearance was character-\\nized by mucosal edema, hyperemia, hypertrophy, and\\nsometimes local ulceration, with progression to granu-\\nlar nodular areas, fibrosis, and occasionally exophytic\\nlesions. 18,19,22,40\\nDR.

       " 'A 66-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of possible toxic epidermal necrolysis.\\nHer medical history included primary hypothyroid- ism, allergy to penicillin, long-standing hypertension, inflammatory arthritis with a positive test for antinu- clear antibodies, and progressive, idiopathic chronic renal failure. The arthritis had been treated for several years with prednisone. Eight months before admission, acute renal tubular necrosis developed during a uri- nary tract infection, and insulin was prescribed for adult-onset diabetes mellitus that had responded for six years to oral hypoglycemic agents. Four months be- fore admission, extracorporeal hemodialysis was initi- ated. Six weeks before admission, methotrexate was begun; two weeks later, oral ulcers appeared, and meth- otrexate was discontinued.\\nThree weeks before admission, an examination at another hospital revealed that the patient had a tem- perature of 37.9°C, with multiple ulcers of the oral mucosa and phar- ynx and cervical lymphadenopa- thy. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). Vancomycin, aztre- onam, clindamycin, and fluconazole were administered intravenously, and leucovorin was given. Hemodialysis was continued three times weekly, and periodic transfusions were given for increasing anemia. The oral ul- cers spread to the lips, and acyclovir was added. Within 24 to 48 hours, a pruritic morbilliform eruption de- veloped on the back and gradually changed to an erythroderma. The day before the patient\\'s admission to this hospital, bullae appeared on the abdomen, and on the next day, sheets of denuded skin were present on the back. Vancomycin and gentamicin were given, and the patient was transferred to the burn unit of this hospital.\\nThe temperature was 37.8°C, the pulse was 76, and the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was 140/55 mm Hg. A rash covered 85 percent of the body surface, sparing the lower legs; the rash was exfoliative on most of the anterior thorax, the face, portions of the ears, the upper arms and legs, and most of the back. The conjunctivae were injected, and multiple bul- lae and ulcers, with a yellow exudate, were present on the lips and oropharyngeal mucosa. The lungs, heart, and abdomen were normal. There was no peripheral edema.\\nLaboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). A radiograph of the chest showed central lines and a small left pleural effusion or thickening. The lungs were clear, but with low volumes. The mediastinum and heart appeared normal. Flexible bronchoscopic exami- nation disclosed pale, edematous bronchial mucosa. Microscopical examination of a biopsy specimen of the skin showed features consistent with toxic epidermal necrolysis (Fig. 1).\\nElective tracheal intubation was performed, with ventilatory assistance. Specimens were obtained for cul- tures. Fluids and electrolytes were administered intra- venously, and insulin, prednisone, levothyroxine, su- cralfate, and multivitamins were given. Erythromycin ointment was applied to the eyes. Sedatives and mor- phine sulfate were administered to control pain. A sin- gle dose of gentamicin was given after each session of extracorporeal hemodialysis. Transfusions of packed red cells were given, and hyperalimentation was initiated. The temperature rose to 39.2°C on the second hospital day and was usually less than 37.8°C during the next few days. Bouts of hypotension were treated with intra- venous fluids and pressor medications.\\nOn the fifth hospital day, a bronchoscopic examination showed sloughing of endobronchial mucosa. Predni- sone was discontinued, and hydrocortisone was administered intravenously. On the eighth hospital day, an ul- trasonographic examination of the abdomen, performed because of oliguria, showed small kidneys. The gall- bladder contained sludge, with pericholecystic fluid. The diameter of the common bile duct was 3.0 mm. Under ultrasonographic guidance, a catheter was inserted into the gallbladder. A specimen of brown bile was sent for culture; microscopical examination revealed abundant gram-negative rods without neutrophils. On the same day, a blood culture yielded gram-negative rods later identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae, and during the next two days, the same organisms grew from cultures of a sputum specimen, specimens obtained from a periph- eral arterial catheter and a pulmonary arterial cathe- ter, and a bile specimen. A culture of urine yielded Escherichia coli and proteus species. The viral culture of a specimen from an oral lesion was negative and re- mained so. Ciprofloxacin was added, and the catheters were replaced.\\nOn the 11th hospital day, the patient\\'s temperature rose to 38.4°C, and hemodynamic instability devel- oped; ceftriaxone was added. Ascitic fluid was detected and was managed by maintaining a negative fluid bal- ance on hemodialysis. A cardiac ultrasonographic ex- amination was normal. On the 14th hospital day, the temperature was 37°C. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest disclosed small, bilateral pleural effusions and left basal air- space disease.\\nOn the 16th hospital day, an ul- trasonographic study of the abdo- men showed the collapse of the gall- bladder about the drainage catheter. Laboratory tests were performed (Ta- bles 1 and 2). Cefotaxime was sub- stituted for ceftriaxone, and a blood specimen was obtained for fungal culture. Although the sedatives had been withdrawn, the patient had a minimal response to noxious stimuli.\\nBy the 20th hospital day, the cutaneous denudation involved the lower arms and legs and patches of regenerating skin on the back. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). Cefotaxime was discontinued, and leucovorin was begun. On the 25th hospital day, laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). A CT scan of the chest (Fig. 2) showed a patchy opac- ity in the right upper lobe and re- solving air-space disease in the left lower lobe. A cranial CT scan (Fig. 3) showed a small hypodense area in the right frontal lobe and low-den- sity changes in the deep white mat- ter — findings consistent with small- vessel disease. Bilateral maxillary air-fluid levels and fluid in the sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses were also ob- served. A CT scan of the abdomen showed diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. The gallbladder remained con- tracted about the drainage catheter. The kidneys were atrophic. A small focus of high attenuation observed within the iliac musculature was consistent with a retroperitoneal hematoma. Microscopical examination of fluid aspirated from both maxillary sinuses showed no neutrophils or microorganisms. Microscopical exami- nation of a stained specimen of sputum revealed septate hyphae. The fungal culture of the blood specimen re- mained negative. Amphotericin was administered. On the next day, the temperature ranged from 36.1°C to 37.3°C, and atrial fibrillation developed. Both flasks of a blood culture yielded gram-negative rods.\\nOn the 27th hospital day, hypotension did not re- spond to medications, and the patient died.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. SCOTT J. THALER*: May we review the radio- graphic findings?\\nDR. MICHELLE M. MCNICHOLAS: The first ultrason- ographic image of the gallbladder shows slight thicken- ing of its wall, suggesting acalculous cholecystitis. A CT scan of the chest obtained on the 14th hospital day shows bilateral, basal pleural effusions with focal con- solidation at the base of the left lung. On the 25th hos- pital day a repeated CT scan of the chest (Fig. 2) dem- onstrates clearing of the effusions but a new area of focal consolidation in the right upper lobe. A CT scan of the abdomen shows that the gallbladder was col- lapsed. The kidneys were atrophic, and a focus of high density consistent with hemorrhage was observed in the region of the left iliopsoas muscle. The cranial CT scan (Fig. 3) shows opacification of the mastoid sinuses, air- fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses, and fluid within the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. The brain windows show periventricular low-density changes consistent with small-vessel disease, as well as a focus of low den- sity in the right frontal lobe, which is consistent with an infarct or early abscess.\\nDR. THALER: There are two broad explanations for this patient\\'s dramatic illness. One possible explana- tion is that the entire disease was initiated by an in- fection that resulted in erythema multiforme or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Erythema multiforme minor is characterized by the abrupt appearance of many crops of up to hundreds of round erythematous lesions on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs. The lesions spread centripetally and are most prominent on areas exposed to sun.¹ Eventually, the center usually clears, forming a typical target (or iris) lesion. Mucosal lesions are minimal. Erythema multiforme major (the Stevens- Johnson syndrome) is preceded by a symptomatic pro- dromal illness lasting one to two weeks, followed by the appearance of similar skin lesions that later evolve into hemorrhagic blisters. Unlike the eruption in erythema multiforme minor, the eruption in erythema multiforme major involves mucosal surfaces and can progress to bullous ulcers and extensive erosions. The associated mortality rate is 5 to 15 percent.2 I believe this patient had toxic epidermal necrolysis, which is characterized by the loss of over 50 percent of the epidermis; a more rapid progression of illness, frequently with the involve- ment of many mucosal surfaces; and a mortality rate of 15 to 50 percent.3\\nIf this patient\\'s illness had been limited to erythema multiforme minor, herpes simplex virus infection followed by erythema multiforme could have explained much of her illness. Herpes simplex virus is probably the most common cause of erythema multiforme minor and may be the only cause of recurrent benign erythe- ma multiforme minor. Up to 65 percent of patients with this disorder have had recent outbreaks of herpes simplex virus infection. Herpes simplex virus DNA has been identified in erythema multiforme minor lesions,5 and acyclovir appears to reduce the frequency of at- tacks of erythema multiforme.6 Infections with Histo- plasma capsulatum, Epstein-Barr virus, and coxsackie- virus B5 have all been linked epidemiologically to erythema multiforme minor but not to erythema mul- tiforme major or toxic epidermal necrolysis. The only reported infectious cause of erythema multiforme ma- jor is Mycoplasma pneumoniae.7,8 Most cases of erythema multiforme major and almost all cases of toxic epider- mal necrolysis are related to drugs. Although sul- fonamides and anticonvulsant drugs are involved most frequently, many other agents, including methotrexate, aztreonam, and vancomycin, can induce erythema mul- tiforme major and toxic epidermal necrolysis. This pa- tient\\'s initial lesions are consistent with an acute in- fection, such as herpes simplex virus infection, but the complicated course of her illness and her exposure to multiple drugs make it difficult to implicate infection as the cause of the toxic epidermal necrolysis.\\nThe patient\\'s presentation with leukopenia, throm- bocytopenia, and mucosal ulceration may reflect the unexpected toxic effects of the relatively low doses of methotrexate she was receiving for arthritis. Metho- trexate is well absorbed orally, excreted by the kidneys, and subject to some degree of enterohepatic circula- tion.9 Two reports suggest that even with relatively low doses of methotrexate (a single dose of 2.5 mg in one case), moderately severe leukopenia and mucositis can occur. 10,11 Drug-induced leukopenia improves during hemodialysis, but methotrexate levels rise again after dialysis because of large intracellular pools of the drug.\" It is possible that the patient under discussion initially had neutropenic mucosal ulceration, present- ing with fever and neutropenia, followed by the devel- opment of drug-related toxic epidermal necrolysis, per- haps caused by exposure to vancomycin or aztreonam.\\nAmong other causes of oral and mucosal lesions in an immunocompromised host, several noninfectious disor- ders should be considered. Systemic lupus erythemato- sus is associated with a variety of cutaneous and oral manifestations, including the common discoid lesion as well as papulosquamous lesions, urticaria, vasculitic le- sions, panniculitis, and herpetiform or bullous lesions.12,13 Oral mucosal lesions, which occur in up to 45 percent of patients with lupus, are typically painless ulcers in- volving the hard palate, although the lips and buccal mucosa can be involved.14 Behçet\\'s syndrome, Wege- ner\\'s granulomatosis, and sarcoidosis also deserve men- tion. Behçet\\'s syndrome is associated with crops of 2-to-10-mm painful, round or oval aphthous ulcers in- volving the lips, gingiva, buccal mucosa, and tongue 15 and, in rare cases, the larynx and palate. Other important manifestations include anterior or posterior uveitis or retinal vasculitis; recurrent, painful genital ulcers; arthritis; numerous gastrointestinal symptoms; and skin lesions. The primary manifestations of Wege- ner\\'s granulomatosis include nasal pain and discharge due to destructive sinusitis and nasal ulcers; pulmonary symptoms such as cough, hemoptysis, and dyspnea; uvei- tis and episcleritis; and renal dysfunction.16 Skin lesions include petechiae and bullous lesions. Skin lesions in sarcoidosis include papular lesions, frequently near the eyes, and violaceous plaques on the trunk, arms, and legs. Oral lesions are typically nontender, well-circum- scribed nodules or plaques involving the lips, tongue, buccal mucosa, and palate.17\\nBlistering lesions and oral ulcers can also be caused by pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid. Pem- phigus vulgaris is characterized by the presence of many flaccid blisters that tend to erode rapidly, leaving large areas of exposed dermis; most patients have extensive mucosal lesions. In contrast, bullous pemphigoid is a self-limited, benign illness. This disorder, which occurs in the elderly, is also characterized by erosions and flac- cid blisters, although typically on the legs; mucosal dis- ease is usually restricted to the buccal mucosa.\\nFinally, I should mention aphthous ulcers or aphthous stomatitis in general. The common “minor” aphthous ulcers are exquisitely painful, round, and less than 1 cm in diameter, with an erythematous base. In patients in- fected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), larger, \"giant\" aphthous ulcers are more common and require systemic corticosteroid therapy.18 Although mi- nor ulcers typically involve the soft palate, tongue, floor of the mouth, and buccal mucosa, HIV-associated ul- cers can also involve the pharynx, epiglottis, hypo- pharynx, and esophagus.19\\nAmong the infectious causes of oral ulcers, I have al- ready mentioned primary herpesvirus infection, which can be severe in adults and is associated with fever, lymphadenopathy, and lesions of the entire oropharynx, which appear initially as vesicles and then as erosions. In immunocompromised hosts, the illness is more pro- longed, and there is far more locally aggressive disease, with hemorrhage and spread to the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Primary infection with varicella- zoster virus or disseminated reactivation of infection oc- casionally involves the oral or genital mucosa. In immu- nocompromised hosts, the chief risk associated with this infection is visceral disease, such as pneumonitis or en- cephalitis, rather than severe mucosal disease. Cyto- megalovirus infection does not usually cause oral ulcer- ation, 20 but it may cause single or multiple palatal or buccal mucosal lesions in HIV-infected patients. 21,22 Fi- nally, Epstein-Barr virus infection may have a number of oral manifestations, including nonspecific pharyngi- tis, with or without exudates, and oral hairy leukoplakia. Patients frequently have cervical lymphadenopathy and tonsillomegaly and may have palatal petechiae, but ero- sions and ulcers are not typical.\\nEnteroviral infections, although epidemiologically unlikely in this case, have been implicated in many diseases, including aseptic meningitis, paralysis, myocardi- tis, and pleurodynia. Herpangina, or quinsy, is caused by several members of the coxsackievirus A and B fam- ilies, as well as by several strains of echovirus, and usu- ally affects young persons in the summertime. The dis- ease characteristically begins with fever, headache, vomiting, and sore throat, followed by the development of 2 to 10 moderately painful macules in the posterior pharynx (typically on the soft palate), which become vesicular and resolve over a period of several days. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease produces similar lesions, except in a more anterior distribution and on the arms and legs.\\nCommon bacteria cause very few ulcerative lesions in the mouth or pharynx. M. pneumoniae infection of the pharynx, although a potentially important cause of erythema multiforme major and minor, is not usually associated with substantial pharyngeal disease. Cory- nebacterium diphtheriae, although extremely rare in the United States, continues to be a problem in some parts of the world, notably in Russia and Eastern Europe. The most common site of disease is the posterior phar- ynx, although the anterior nares, the larynx, and the entire tracheobronchial tree can be involved. The dis- ease is characterized by a dense, necrotic coagulum on the tonsillar pillars that is initially white and then turns gray, green, and black.23 Involvement of the anterior mucosal surfaces is rare and very mild, and hence not consistent with the findings in this patient.\\nSyphilis and tuberculosis deserve mention as uncom- mon but distinctive causes of oral lesions. All three stages of syphilis are characterized by lesions in the mouth,24,25 but none of this patient\\'s lesions appeared to be sufficiently aggressive or ulcerative to account for the deterioration in her condition. Oral tuberculosis, which is rare, is usually the result of secondary spread from pulmonary tuberculosis. The lesions may be ul- cers, plaques, nodules, or fissures, and pain is more fre- quent when the oral lesions are secondarily infected by bacteria. Disseminated infection with Mycobacterium avi- um complex can cause necrotic oral ulcers, 3 to 4 cm in diameter, in an HIV-infected patient. 26\\nNocardia species are uncommon causes of oral ulcer- ation. I could find only one report linking oral lesions to nocardia, involving a patient with severe periodontal infection.27\\nSeveral clues in this patient\\'s history point to a fun- gal infection. In patients with systemic lupus erythema- tosus, particularly those receiving corticosteroid medi- cation, the function of circulating neutrophils and tissue macrophages is markedly impaired. The consumption of complement proteins during acute flares of autoim- mune diseases leads to impaired opsonization of candi- da species and bacteria, and corticosteroids impair vir- tually all the functions of phagocytes. In this patient, diabetes mellitus, drug-induced neutropenia, grossly denuded skin barriers, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics could all have contributed to colonization and infection with both yeasts and molds. Infection with candida or Cryptococcus neoformans may cause both oral lesions and disseminated disease. Oropharyngeal candidiasis, or thrush, typically produces a loosely ad- herent white membrane, most commonly on the buccal mucosa but also on the gums, uvula, tongue, palate, and esophagus. Pseudomembranes, which resemble ul- cers, have also been reported. 28 The typical oral lesions of cryptococcosis are large, somewhat painful ulcers on the palate, although the tonsils, tongue, and gingiva may be involved as well.29 Both candida and cryptococ- cus, however, should grow in fungal blood cultures but did not in this case. Also, the patchy pulmonary opaci- ties, sinus disease, and hypodensity seen on the cranial CT scan are more characteristic of infection with molds than of infection with yeasts.\\nInfections with the dimorphic fungi H. capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, and Paracoc- cidioides brasiliensis range from asymptomatic illnesses to influenza-like illnesses to acute dissemination or rapidly progressive pneumonia, depending on the im- mune status of the host. In immunocompromised adults, chronic, progressive, disseminated histoplasmosis is characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytope- nia, and in half the cases, multiple, painful, heaped-up ulcers in the mouth, usually involving the tongue, buc- cal mucosa, gingiva, and larynx.30 Blastomycosis typi- cally produces verrucous skin lesions and may produce ulcerative lesions. Oral lesions are uncommon and usu- ally occur as single, painless lesions. Coccidioidomyco- sis is associated with a variety of skin lesions, but pain- less oral ulcers have been reported only occasionally. In contrast, in paracoccidioidomycosis, cutaneous (usually facial) and mucosal verrucous and ulcerating lesions are very common. All these dimorphic fungi, however, are limited geographically, and none are endemic to the northeastern United States. More important, as dimor- phic organisms, they grow in the form of molds only at lower temperatures in the laboratory and in the form of yeasts at 37°C. The patient under discussion had septate hyphae in the sputum, which would not be ex- pected with these fungi. It is possible that she had mu- cormycosis, but this mold has broad, typically non- septate hyphae with right-angle branches, unlike the hyphae in the sputum smear from this patient.\\nThe best explanation for the patient\\'s fatal illness is infection with aspergillus or a morphologically similar mold. A number of fungi described recently in both normal and immunocompromised hosts appear similar in tissue specimens to aspergillus. 31 Differentiation from aspergillus may not be possible until the organism is grown and the sexual stage is analyzed morphologi- cally. A few examples of these look-alike fungi include fusarium, Pseudallescheria boydii, curvularia, Trichosporon capitatum and T. beigelii, geotrichum, and alternaria. These organisms have unique predilections, although all of them can cause invasive disease. Fusarium, for example, is frequently associated with skin lesions and may cause widespread disease, including brain abscess, osteomyelitis, and pneumonia in recipients of bone mar- row grafts, and is strongly associated with ongoing neu- tropenia. Alternaria species and curvularia are \"black molds\" that possess a melanin-like pigment on the walls of their hyphae. In tissue smears the pigment can be difficult to see, and the fungi may resemble aspergil- lus. Both alternaria and curvularia most frequently cause a variably invasive sinusitis in normal hosts but may disseminate to the central nervous system in com- promised hosts. P. boydii, although much less common than aspergillus, can be extraordinarily difficult to dis- tinguish from it in tissue specimens, and the spectrum of disease caused by the two fungi is very similar. It is important to note that P. boydii is frequently resistant to amphotericin B.\\nOn epidemiologic grounds, however, aspergillus must be considered the most likely organism in this case. Aspergillus species cause a spectrum of pulmo- nary disease. Patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis have eosinophilia, elevated IgE levels, anti-aspergillus agglutinins, and fleeting pulmonary in- filtrates from intermittent mucous plugging. Charac- teristically, hyphae are visible in the mucus plugs, and with chronic damage, saccular bronchiectasis can re- sult. Aspergillomas (fungus balls) represent true sap- rophytic colonization of a preexisting pulmonary cavity. Although pulmonary invasion is rare, fatal hemoptysis occurs in 3 to 5 percent of patients. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis presents as a subacute pneumonia, usually beginning as a perihilar target lesion pathologically, with a central zone of necrosis, a surrounding rim of hemorrhage, and a thrombosed artery at the periph- ery.32 The lesion spreads outward as additional tissue is infarcted. Spread to the sinuses is common, and hema- togenous dissemination occurs in approximately 25 per- cent of patients.\\nThis patient had evidence of sinus disease, pulmo- nary consolidation, a probable brain abscess or infarct, and markedly abnormal endobronchial mucosa. In the light of the last finding and because of the overwhelm- ing risk of fungal infection, I believe that pseudomem- branous, necrotizing tracheobronchial aspergillosis de- veloped, complicated by dissemination to the central nervous system. Young et al.33 described eight patients with tracheobronchitis and noted that they were some- what less immunocompromised than the patients with the usual invasive pulmonary disease. Several recent case reports have strengthened the association between aspergillus and tracheobronchitis. 33-36 Patients present with dyspnea, wheezing, and occasionally hemoptysis. Films of the chest are relatively normal. The patient under discussion was intubated rapidly, despite clear lungs on radiologic examination initially. Most of the patients have a necrotizing ulcerative pseudomembrane consisting of fibrinous exudate, with variable degrees of local invasion, but some have a tenacious plug of mucus obstructing the airway. Dissemination can occur despite the absence of local invasion or pulmonary dis- ease. 36 Necrotizing, pseudomembranous aspergillus in- fection has also been reported after lung transplan- tation, particularly at the region of the bronchial anastomosis, 37 as well as more frequently in association with HIV infection.38\\nIn conclusion, this woman had toxic epidermal ne- crolysis due to exposure to a drug and subsequent su- perinfection of the tracheobronchial tree, most likely with Aspergillus fumigatus, with dissemination to the brain and possibly the sinuses. Alternative diagnoses include superinfections with other fungi, in particular P. boydii, or possibly with Nocardia asteroides, but these diagnoses are less likely epidemiologically.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nToxic epidermal necrolysis, ? fungal superinfection.\\n\\nDR. SCOTT J. THALER\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nTracheobronchial aspergillosis, with dissemination to the brain.\\nDrug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. ELIZABETH M. BAILEY: At autopsy the epider- mis was denuded over 90 percent of the body surface (Fig. 4). Examination of the lung revealed multiple bronchocentric areas of hemorrhage and necrosis as- sociated with numerous septate hyphae branching at 45 degrees. Fungi had invaded through the bronchial wall into adjacent lung parenchyma. Conidiophores (fruiting bodies), which are characteristic of aspergillus species, were present in the lumens of the trachea and large bronchi and were mixed with mucus and inflam- matory cells (Fig. 5). Many fungal thrombi were present throughout the pulmonary vessels and those of other organs, including the left kidney, with invasion through vascular walls (Fig. 6). An adherent thrombus in the right ventricle (Fig. 7) was permeated by fungi, which had invaded the underlying endocardium. Multiple tan- nish brown-to-red lesions of invasive aspergillosis, in- cluding the one seen on the CT scan, were found in the gray and white matter of the frontal, temporal, and pa- rietal lobes of the brain. A fungal culture of lung tissue was positive for A. fumigatus.\\nThe kidneys were small end-stage kidneys with dia- betic glomerulopathy.\\nThus, the diagnosis is invasive aspergillosis, proba- bly of the bronchopneumonic type, with secondary angioinvasion and dissemination to multiple organs, com- plicating toxic epidermal necrolysis.\\nDespite the infected thrombus in the right ventricle, with multiorgan intravascular thrombi, cultures of blood specimens obtained before the patient died were nega- tive. Negative cultures are common in cases of aspergil- lus infection.\\nInfections caused by aspergillus species are usually divided into three categories: saprophytic infection (such as aspergilloma), allergic infection (such as allergic bron- chopulmonary aspergillosis), and invasive infection.39 An immune response due to preexisting disease and its treatment predisposes the host to invasive aspergillosis. In particular, corticosteroid therapy is known to predis- pose patients to invasive aspergillosis. In addition, a va- riety of immunologic impairments have been observed in patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis.40\\nToxic epidermal necrolysis, or Lyell\\'s syndrome, named after Lyell, who first described the disease in 1956,41 is an uncommon idiosyncratic drug reaction in- volving epidermal necrosis that may be massive, as in this patient. Although usually caused by exposure to sulfonamides or anticonvulsant agents, the disorder has been reported in patients receiving methotrexate. 42,43 Sepsis, usually due to Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudo- monas aeruginosa, has been reported in 40 percent of patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis and was the primary cause of death in these patients. 3,42 To my knowledge, only one case of disseminated aspergillosis has been reported as a complication of toxic epidermal necrolysis.44 In that case, as in the patient under discus- sion, aspergillus infection began in the lungs, with dis- semination to multiple organs.',\n",
       " 'A 37-year-old man with the acquired immunode-\\nficiency syndrome (AIDS) was admitted to the hos-\\npital because of dyspnea and wheezing of three\\nmonths\\' duration.\\nNine years earlier, a test for antibodies against the\\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had been\\npositive. Five years before admission, a tuberculin\\nskin test (purified protein derivative, 5 TU) was pos-\\nitive, and isoniazid was administered for a year. Four-\\nteen months and 10 months before admission, he\\nwas treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and\\nthereafter received prophylactic doses of dapsone. He\\nthen felt well until three months before admission,\\nwhen mild dyspnea and wheezing developed. An al-\\nbuterol inhaler was ineffective.\\nTen weeks before admission, he was readmitted to\\nthe hospital. He had no history of asthma or ecze-\\nma. A physical examination showed expiratory wheez-\\nes throughout both lungs. Radiographs of the chest\\nrevealed almost complete resolution of a diffuse\\nground-glass process that had been present on pre-\\nvious chest films. Pulmonary-function studies were\\nperformed (Table 1). Examination of induced-spu-\\ntum and bronchoalveolar-lavage specimens revealed\\nno P. carinii, acid-fast bacilli, or other pathogenic\\nmicroorganisms. A computed tomographic (CT) scan\\nof the thorax showed faint ground-glass opacities in\\nthe right upper and middle lobes and both lower\\nlobes, slight septal thickening bilaterally, and a calci-\\nfied left hilar lymph node. The airways were patent.\\nThe administration of theophylline resulted in im-\\nprovement. The patient was discharged on the fourth\\nhospital day with instructions to take extended-release\\ntheophylline (300 mg twice daily), loratadine, and his\\ncustomary medications.\\nThere was no further improvement in his condi-\\ntion, despite multiple measures that included the\\naddition of a flunisolide inhaler; larger doses of the-\\nophylline, which he could not tolerate; and the dis-\\ncontinuation of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for\\none month, with the substitution of one dose of\\nintravenously administered pentamidine. Seventeen\\ndays before admission, laboratory tests were per-\\nformed (Tables 2 and 3). Pulmonary-function stud-\\nies were repeated 12 days before admission (Table\\n1). The patient was readmitted to the hospital.\\nThe patient was a former fisherman. He had abused\\nalcohol and intravenous drugs until four years before\\nadmission. He had a 60 pack-year history of cigarette\\nsmoking and had stopped smoking 13 months be-\\nfore admission. The epidemiologic and environmen-\\ntal history was unrevealing. There was no history of\\nforeign travel, exposure to pets or other animals,\\nabdominal pain, diarrhea, or weight loss, and there\\nwas no personal or family history of asthma or ecze-\\nma. His medications at the time of admission were\\ntrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, double strength\\n(one tablet daily); a flunisolide inhaler (four puffs\\nthree times daily); an ipratropium inhaler (two puffs\\ntwice daily); extended-release theophylline (125 mg\\ntwice daily); didanosine (200 mg twice daily); zido-\\nvudine (300 mg daily); and clotrimazole troches\\n(five times daily).\\nThe temperature was 36.7°C, the pulse was 82,\\nand the respirations were 22. The blood pressure\\nwas 120/90 mm Hg.\\nOn physical examination, the patient appeared ro-\\nbust, but he became tachypneic with minimal activ-\\nity. No rash or lymphadenopathy was found, except\\nfor a single left supraclavicular lymph node, 1 cm in\\ndiameter. His head was normal, and there was no ev-\\nidence of nasal polyps or thrush. His neck was sup-\\nple. Diffuse expiratory wheezes were heard in both\\nlungs. His heart, abdomen, arms and legs, and rec-\\ntum were normal, and a neurologic examination was\\nnormal.\\nThe urine was normal. Hematologic tests were\\nperformed (Table 2). Blood chemical values were\\nnormal except that the total protein level was 9.1 g\\nper deciliter (albumin, 4.2; globulin, 4.9), and the\\ncarbon dioxide level was 23.3 mmol per liter.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. DANIEL M. STEIGMAN*: May we review the\\nCT scan?\\nDR. PHILLIP M. BOISELLE: High-resolution CT\\nimages of the chest show subtle foci of ground-glass\\nattenuation in the peripheral portions of the right\\nupper and middle lobes and both lower lobes, as\\nwell as a small, calcified left hilar lymph node. There\\nis no evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\\nDR. STEIGMAN: This patient with AIDS and rap-\\nidly progressive dyspnea and wheezing had none of\\nthe constitutional symptoms of advanced AIDS, such\\nas weight loss or fever; he was described as “robust.”\\nHe also had a normal serum albumin level, which has\\nbeen associated with an excellent short-term progno-\\nsis in patients with this disease.¹ The chief physical\\nfinding was wheezing, indicating partial obstruction\\nof the airways. Wheezing is uncommon in patients\\nwith AIDS, and pulmonary disease in such patients is\\nmuch more likely to be due to infections or malig-\\nnant tumors unassociated with wheezing.\\nWhen a pulmonologist is asked to evaluate a pa-\\ntient with AIDS, it is often to perform a fiberoptic\\nbronchoscopic examination with bronchoalveolar\\nlavage or a transbronchial biopsy to diagnose a pul-\\nmonary infection. This patient\\'s bronchoalveolar-\\nlavage specimen did not contain acid-fast organisms\\nor pneumocystis. I assume no endobronchial abnor-\\nmalities were found.\\nThe fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination, as well\\nas the radiologic findings, help rule out tuberculosis\\nin this case. Although either typical or atypical my-\\ncobacterial infection should be included in the dif-\\nferential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms in any\\npatient with AIDS, my suspicion is heightened by\\nthe history of a positive tuberculin test and the cal-\\ncified hilar lymph node seen on the CT scan, in-\\ndicating previous tuberculosis. The patient received\\na full course of isoniazid prophylaxis, and although\\nthere is some evidence of its efficacy in patients with\\nAIDS,² the data are inconclusive.³ Although the\\nstain for acid-fast bacilli in the bronchoalveolar-\\nlavage fluid was negative, this test is not particularly\\nsensitive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in this set-\\nting. A culture is more sensitive.⁴ The reported\\nfindings on earlier chest radiographs and the ap-\\npearance of the chest on the CT scan are also not\\ntypical of a reactivation of tuberculosis in patients\\nwith advanced AIDS, which is characterized by\\nnoncavitating parenchymal infiltrates, pleural effu-\\nsions, and massive hilar and mediastinal lymphade-\\nnopathy.⁵\\nThe pulmonary-function tests performed eight\\nweeks apart help determine the nature of this pa-\\ntient\\'s disorder. The pulmonary-function testing\\ncomprises spirometry, which is used partly as a meas-\\nure of airway function; lung-volume measurements,\\nwhich help confirm the spirometric findings or pro-\\nvide evidence of disease not apparent on spirometry⁶;\\nand carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, a functional\\nmeasure of the pulmonary vasculature.\\nOne or more pulmonary-function tests are often\\nabnormal in HIV-positive patients with or without\\nclinically apparent pulmonary involvement. The car-\\nbon monoxide diffusing capacity is slightly lower in\\nHIV-positive patients with CD4+ counts of less\\nthan 400 per cubic millimeter or with thrush, weight\\nloss, or herpes zoster than in HIV-positive patients\\nwith CD4+ counts over 400 per cubic millimeter or\\nHIV-negative patients with risk factors for HIV in-\\nfection.⁷ Whether this reduction is due entirely to\\nthe HIV or partly to confounding factors, such as\\nintravenous drug abuse, is unclear. Longitudinal\\nstudies have shown that diffusing capacities decrease\\nby more than 20 percent in some patients with AIDS\\nbut no clinical evidence of pulmonary disease.⁸\\nThe first spirometric studies in this patient, show-\\ning decreases in forced vital capacity and forced ex-\\npiratory volume in one second, are equivocal, since\\nthe ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second\\nto forced vital capacity, the sine qua non of obstruc-\\ntive disease, is normal. It is unclear whether the pa-\\ntient\\'s decreased vital capacity was due to restrictive\\ndisease or to difficulty performing the maneuver, re-\\nsulting in an artifactually decreased vital capacity\\nand increased ratio of forced expiratory volume in\\none second to forced vital capacity. The lung vol-\\numes help clarify this issue. The patient\\'s normal to-\\ntal lung capacity makes restrictive disease as a pri-\\nmary process unlikely. The increased ratio of residual\\nvolume to total lung capacity was due to air trapping\\ncaused by airway obstruction. Thus, the patient\\'s\\nforced expiratory volume in one second was de-\\ncreased because of airway obstruction. There is no\\ndefinite evidence of restrictive disease, but the nor-\\nmal total lung capacity may be indirect evidence of\\na combined disorder.⁹ This pattern, however, can\\nalso be seen in patients with airway disorders alone.⁶\\nThe patient\\'s carbon monoxide diffusing capacity\\nwas decreased. Among HIV-related diseases that can\\ncause a decreased diffusing capacity are P. carinii\\npneumonia¹⁰ and Kaposi\\'s sarcoma.¹¹ In this patient,\\nhowever, the decrease in diffusing capacity was pri-\\nmarily due to anemia. His hematocrit was 31 per-\\ncent. If this value corresponded to a hemoglobin\\nlevel of 10 g per deciliter, calculated according to a\\nwell-established equation,¹² the carbon monoxide\\ndiffusing capacity was 70 percent of the predicted\\nvalue, and the corrected carbon monoxide diffusing\\ncapacity, or diffusion per unit of alveolar volume,\\nwas normal. The alveolar volume is the lung volume\\ncalculated by dilution of a single breath of helium in\\nthe gas mixture inhaled for the test of carbon mon-\\noxide diffusing capacity. This value allows us to cal-\\nculate the corrected carbon monoxide diffusing ca-\\npacity, which is the diffusing capacity per unit of\\nlung volume, and can help in interpreting a low val-\\nue. For example, a patient with normal lung paren-\\nchyma has a decreased carbon monoxide diffusing\\ncapacity after a lobectomy, because fewer lung units\\nare available to absorb carbon monoxide, but the al-\\nveolar volume is low because of decreased lung vol-\\nume, and the diffusion per unit of alveolar volume\\nis thus normal. This phenomenon can also be seen\\nin some types of airway obstruction in which the\\ncarbon monoxide diffusing capacity is low because\\nof a poor distribution of gas, which also causes a de-\\ncreased alveolar volume but a normal corrected dif-\\nfusing capacity.¹³\\nThus, these initial pulmonary-function tests indi-\\ncate that the patient had an obstructive process, with\\nminimal involvement of the pulmonary vasculature.\\nThe second set of pulmonary-function tests, per-\\nformed after the dyspnea had increased, confirms\\nthe clinical impression of worsening airway disease.\\nThe alveolar volume decreased from 5.56 to 3.12 li-\\nters, whereas the total lung capacity remained nearly\\nthe same. This inconsistency is an indirect indication\\nof increasing airway obstruction.¹⁴\\nThus, this patient had progressive airway disease,\\nwhich was initially thought to be asthma, a primary\\nconsideration in any patient with wheezing and\\ndyspnea. Asthma usually presents episodically, ac-\\ncompanied by cough, often with symptoms at rest\\nand at night. This patient had an elevated IgE level,\\nwhich is common in patients with asthma¹⁵ but is\\nalso present in HIV-positive patients with CD4+\\ncounts of less than 200 per cubic millimeter.¹⁶ The\\npatient was treated with inhaled corticosteroids for\\nasthma, but his clinical status deteriorated. Although\\nthere are often compliance problems with inhaled\\ncorticosteroids, his condition should have improved\\nafter six weeks of treatment if he had been taking\\nthem and if he had asthma.¹⁷ I cannot explain the\\npatient\\'s initial response to theophylline. We have no\\nobjective evidence of his pulmonary function at the\\ntime of the improvement, although symptoms of\\nasthma can improve before there is any change in\\nspirometric studies. Eventually, however, his condi-\\ntion deteriorated, despite increasing doses of theo-\\nphylline.\\nIn view of the patient\\'s history of smoking, the di-\\nagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\\nmust be considered. He had stopped smoking a year\\nbefore admission. Obstructive abnormalities due to\\nsmoking alone are very rare at his age.¹⁸ With the\\ncessation of smoking, the forced expiratory volume\\nin one second decreases at a rate identical to that in\\nnonsmokers. I would not have expected deteriora-\\ntion in the forced expiratory volume in one second\\nover a period of six weeks, as occurred in this case,\\nif the patient had had chronic obstructive pulmo-\\nnary disease. An \"emphysema-like\" disease has been\\nreported in patients with HIV infection who do not\\nhave any other pulmonary disease.¹⁹ This syndrome\\npresents with dyspnea on exertion; spirometry shows\\na normal ratio of forced expiratory volume in one\\nsecond to forced vital capacity, a decreased mean\\nforced expiratory flow between 25 and 75 percent\\nof vital capacity, decreased diffusion per unit of al-\\nveolar volume, and increased residual volume. The\\nchest film in patients with this disease can be normal\\nor show hyperinflation, and the CT scan reveals\\nmild-to-diffuse bullous disease. This patient\\'s rapidly\\nprogressive dyspnea and pulmonary-function abnor-\\nmalities are not consistent with emphysema-like pul-\\nmonary disease.\\nP. carinii pneumonia can present with wheezing\\nand peak flow rates that indicate obstruction, which\\ncan improve with bronchodilator medication.²⁰ Pa-\\ntients who have P. carinii pneumonia without wheez-\\ning can have a positive response to methacholine\\nchallenge, which indicates bronchial hyperreactivity.\\nThe carbon monoxide diffusing capacity is decreased\\nin patients with P. carinii pneumonia. In this case,\\nthe chest film obtained 10 weeks before the final\\nadmission showed improvement, as compared with\\nthe earlier film obtained when he had had P. carinii\\npneumonia. Changes can persist on CT scans after\\nthe successful treatment of P. carinii pneumonia.²¹\\nThe combination of negative findings on broncho-\\nalveolar lavage, improvement on chest films, and\\nnormal carbon monoxide diffusing capacity makes\\nthis diagnosis unlikely.\\nKaposi\\'s sarcoma can also be associated with wheez-\\ning and spirometric findings consistent with an ob-\\nstructive process.¹¹ The absence of evidence of this\\ndisease, such as a decreased carbon monoxide diffus-\\ning capacity and characteristic radiographic and CT\\nfindings, makes this diagnosis unlikely.\\nI believe that this patient had a form of bron-\\nchiolitis²²,²³ or bronchiolitis obliterans.\\nBronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia,\\nor cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, results from\\ndamage to the small airways, causing the develop-\\nment of intraluminal plugs of fibrous tissue that ex-\\ntend into and fill the alveolar spaces. This process\\nresults in patchy infiltrates on chest films and CT\\nscans. Pulmonary-function testing reveals a mild\\nrestrictive defect and a slightly decreased carbon\\nmonoxide diffusing capacity. Bronchiolitis obliter-\\nans organizing pneumonia presents insidiously, with\\nincreasing dyspnea, fever, sweats, and cough.²⁴ There\\nare multiple reports of this syndrome in patients\\nwith AIDS.²⁵,²⁶ The patient under discussion had\\nminimal changes on chest films and CT scans and\\nhad obstructive, not restrictive, changes on pulmo-\\nnary-function testing, with no fever or cough, mak-\\ning this diagnosis unlikely.\\nA lymphocytic bronchiolitis has been reported in\\na patient with AIDS.²⁷ It was associated with pro-\\ngressively increasing dyspnea, as in the patient under\\ndiscussion, but with a nonproductive cough and\\nmild restrictive and obstructive disease. In the re-\\nported case, however, the diffusing capacity was low,\\nand chest films showed a diffuse micronodular infil-\\ntrate. Eighteen months after the diagnosis, the dis-\\nease had not progressed either physiologically or\\nclinically, and the patient had no wheezing. Al-\\nthough it is difficult to generalize from one case re-\\nport, the absence of wheezing, the findings on chest\\nfilms, and the absence of a progressive course make\\nlymphocytic bronchiolitis unlikely in the patient un-\\nder discussion.\\nMicrosporidial bronchiolitis has also been report-\\ned in a patient with AIDS²⁸ who had Encephalitozo-\\non hellem keratoconjunctivitis, a subsequent infil-\\ntrate in the left lower lobe, wheezing, pleuritic chest\\npain, and fever. A transbronchial biopsy revealed\\nbronchiolitis, with microsporidial spores within the\\ncytoplasm of bronchiolar and alveolar duct cells.\\nE. hellem has also been reported in the tracheobron-\\nchial epithelium in a patient with AIDS.²⁹ In the pa-\\ntient under discussion, the absence of a previous mi-\\ncrosporidial infection makes this diagnosis unlikely.\\nFollicular bronchiolitis is characterized by lymphoid\\nhyperplasia, with germinal centers compressing bron-\\nchioles and occurring elsewhere in the lung as well. In\\na series of 19 patients with follicular bronchiolitis,\\n1 had AIDS.³⁰ Three subgroups of patients were de-\\nscribed: those with immunodeficiency states, includ-\\ning the patient with AIDS; those with autoimmune\\ndisease, mainly rheumatoid arthritis; and those with\\nan idiopathic \"hypersensitivity.” The patients present-\\ned with progressive dyspnea, cough, and weight loss.\\nPulmonary-function testing revealed obstructive or re-\\nstrictive defects, or both; radiographs of the chest usu-\\nally showed a bilateral reticulonodular pattern. The\\nabsence of that pattern in this case makes the diagno-\\nsis of follicular bronchiolitis unlikely.\\nThe disorder that best fits the findings in this case\\nis constrictive bronchiolitis, an airway disease charac-\\nterized by the development of dyspnea over a period\\nof months to years. Patients may have a history of\\nwheezing, but it is uncommon on physical examina-\\ntion. Cough can occur, but sputum production is\\nminimal. Spirometry reveals an obstructive defect;\\nthere is a decreased ratio of residual volume to total\\nlung capacity, and the total lung capacity is usually\\nnormal.³¹,³² The diffusing capacity is decreased; how-\\never, the corrected diffusing capacity is nearly nor-\\nmal.³² Chest films can either be normal or show hy-\\nperinflation and vascular attenuation.³³ The CT scan\\nis often abnormal, showing alternating areas of high\\nand low attenuation.³⁴ Microscopical examination can\\nshow intraluminal obstruction, as in bronchiolitis ob-\\nliterans organizing pneumonia, but the obstruction\\ndoes not extend into the pulmonary acinus, as it does\\nin bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia.\\nThe hallmark of constrictive bronchiolitis is inflam-\\nmation of the bronchiolar wall, causing extraluminal\\nobstruction. Bronchoalveolar lavage shows a larger\\nnumber of neutrophils than in smokers with bron-\\nchitis or nonsmokers.³² A particularly fulminant ver-\\nsion of this disease has been associated with rheuma-\\ntoid arthritis.³⁵ This diagnosis usually requires an\\nopen-lung biopsy. I believe that this patient under-\\nwent a thoracoscopic lung biopsy. Constrictive bron-\\nchiolitis has not been reported in patients with\\nAIDS. In view of the possibility of confusing con-\\nstrictive bronchiolitis with asthma, however, I won-\\nder whether some patients with AIDS have been\\ntreated empirically with corticosteroids, and the di-\\nagnosis of constrictive bronchiolitis has been missed.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Dr. Basgoz, what was\\nyour impression before the diagnostic procedure?\\nDR. NESLI BASGOZ: I saw this patient as an out-\\npatient for several months and then followed him\\nthroughout his hospitalizations. I concluded that\\nmost infections would have been detected by the di-\\nagnostic workup that had been performed, but some\\nunusual infections might not have been found. Al-\\nthough asthma seemed the most likely diagnosis,\\nmany infectious and noninfectious diseases in HIV-\\npositive patients can present with reactive airways.\\nWe believed that even a small risk of infection would\\nbe unacceptable if we were to proceed with cortico-\\nsteroid therapy, and we requested a thoracoscopic\\nopen-lung biopsy to make a definitive diagnosis.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\n? Asthma.\\n? Reactive airway disease.\\nDR. DANIEL M. STEIGMAN\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nConstrictive bronchiolitis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. MARK: A thoracoscopic biopsy of the lingula,\\nwhich was indurated, was performed. Microscopical\\nexamination revealed that the lumens of small sub-\\nsegmental bronchi were narrowed by greatly thick-\\nened, edematous, inflamed mucosal folds (Fig. 1).\\nThe epithelium consisted almost entirely of mucin-\\nsecreting cells. The lumens contained mucus and\\nsloughed epithelium. The changes are those of an\\nacute episode of asthma as severe as that seen in fatal\\nstatus asthmaticus.³⁶⁻³⁹ The adventitial inflammation\\nof muscular pulmonary arteries adjacent to occluded\\nairways that is seen in fatal asthma⁴⁰ was not present.\\nThe mucous plugging extended into terminal and\\nrespiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts but not\\ninto alveoli (Fig. 2). No organisms were present.\\nThe mucus in the bronchioles and alveolar ducts\\nwas sprinkled with eosinophils (Fig. 3), but subpleu-\\nral lobules of lung were filled with eosinophils and\\nhistiocytes characteristic of an eosinophilic pneumonia\\n(Fig. 4), which explains the subpleural ground-glass\\ndensities seen on the CT scans. A few bronchioles\\ncontained small fibrous plugs indicative of bronchi-\\nolitis obliterans, suggesting a healing process. Bron-\\nchiolitis obliterans can occur in association with\\nchronic eosinophilic pneumonia, with or without\\nasthma. The microscopical changes of bronchiolitis\\nwith patchy organizing pneumonia may overlap those\\nof chronic eosinophilic pneumonia,⁴¹,⁴² and in such\\ncases, both the clinical and pathological distinction\\nbetween the two diseases may be blurred.\\nThere was thickening of the bronchial basement\\nmembrane, as seen in asthma,³⁶,³⁸,⁴³ including mild\\nasthma and asthma in remission, as well as in other\\nconditions. The thickening is due to subepithelial\\ndeposition of type III and V collagen and fibronec-\\ntin, suggesting the role of fibroblasts rather than ep-\\nithelial cells.⁴⁴ Bronchial smooth muscle appeared\\nhypertrophied. Although bronchial smooth muscle\\nhas been thought to be hyperplastic or hypertro-\\nphied in patients with chronic asthma,³⁰,³⁸,⁴⁵ the au-\\nthors of a recent study of bronchi larger than those\\nusually studied concluded that the muscle thick-\\nening apparent histologically was not always due to\\nan increased number of smooth-muscle cells,⁴⁶ but\\nshortening of muscle cells with functional changes\\ncan occur without an increase in the amount of\\nsmooth muscle. Other authors have found airway\\nhyperresponsiveness with no apparent change in the\\nstructure of bronchial epithelium in specimens ob-\\ntained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in patients with\\nmild atopic asthma.⁴⁷\\nDr. Basgoz, how have you managed the patient\\'s\\ncare since the biopsy?\\nDR. BASGOZ: Since all special stains and cultures\\nwere negative for infection, we started to administer\\nhigh-dose corticosteroids, to which he had a rapid re-\\nsponse, with virtually immediate resolution of his\\nwheezing and tachypnea. We are now trying to taper\\nthe corticosteroid dose to control his symptoms with-\\nout increasing the risk of opportunistic infection.\\nDR. STEIGMAN: I wonder in retrospect whether a\\nbrief course of oral corticosteroid therapy before the\\nbiopsy would have been helpful. Corticosteroid ther-\\napy is used in cases of AIDS without apparent ill ef-\\nfect, as in severe P. carinii pneumonia. This patient\\nhad a chronic indolent form of asthma. An appro-\\npriate course of treatment would have been low-\\ndose oral corticosteroid therapy (20 to 30 mg of\\nprednisone per day) for perhaps a week. If there had\\nbeen improvement in either peak flow measure-\\nments or spirometric studies, one could have add-\\ned an inhaled antiinflammatory medication, such as\\nnedocromil sodium or cromolyn sodium (since the\\npatient apparently could not tolerate inhaled cor-\\nticosteroids), and then tapered the corticosteroids to\\nthe lowest possible dose. Perhaps if improvement\\nhad occurred after such therapy, an open biopsy could\\nhave been avoided.\\nADDENDUM\\nDR. BASGOZ: Eight months after discharge, the\\npatient continues to be well, but it has not yet been\\npossible to reduce the corticosteroid dose to less\\nthan 20 mg per day. His AIDS is stable, without a\\nchange in the T-cell count or the viral load (about\\n20,000 RNA copies per milliliter).',\n",
       " \"The New England Journal of MedicineClinical Problem-SolvingA HIDDEN AGENDAMICHAEL LANDOR, M.D.A 35-year-old man presented to the hospital inDecember 1996 with a 10-day history of fever(temperature as high as 40°C [104°F]) and 1-dayhistory of nausea, vomiting, and mild abdominalpain in the right upper quadrant. He denied hav-ing headache, rash, diarrhea, or neurologic, res-piratory tract, musculoskeletal, or genitourinarytract symptoms. Evaluation by a physician eightdays earlier had not revealed the source of the fe-ver. The patient appeared healthy, with no pallor,jaundice, or stigmata of liver insufficiency. Ex-cept for the presence of mild tenderness in theright upper quadrant of the abdomen and mod-erate hypotonia of the anal sphincter, the exam-ination was unremarkable. The stool was nega-tive for occult blood.This young man had an acute change in his usualstate of health, characterized by high fever. My firstconcern is an infectious disease either limited tothe abdomen or a generalized process with intraab-dominal involvement. Laboratory tests may helpcharacterize the process and pinpoint its location.The white-cell count was 7600 per cubic milli-meter, with 73 percent granulocytes, 24 percentlymphocytes, 2 percent monocytes, and 1 percenteosinophils. Laboratory tests revealed the follow-ing values: hemoglobin, 8.1 g per deciliter, withnormal red-cell indexes; lactate dehydrogenase,239 U per liter; aspartate aminotransferase, 50 Uper liter; total bilirubin, 3.1 mg per deciliter;conjugated bilirubin, 1.8 mg per deciliter; alka-line phosphatase, 167 U per liter; 5'-nucleoti-dase, 28 U per liter; total protein, 5.5 g per dec-iliter; and albumin, 2.7 g per deciliter. Urinalysiswas positive for bilirubin and urobilinogen andnegative for white cells and bacteria. Two sets ofblood cultures were negative, and radiography ofthe chest was unrevealing.These results indicate some kind of hepatobiliaryprocess, but the absence of leukocytosis and leftwardshift suggests that an acute bacterial infection, suchas ascending cholangitis or sepsis, is not likely. Viral,granulomatous, alcoholic, metabolic, or malignantliver involvement should be considered, as well asextrahepatic biliary obstruction such as by calculi,lymphadenopathy, or a pancreatic lesion.The patient immigrated to the United Statesfrom Colombia at the age of 27. He recalled hav-ing hepatitis as a child and jaundice as a teenag-er, but could not remember details. He had livedin an urban area of Colombia and had not beenin contact with anybody with a contagious dis-ease. He had never been hospitalized or receiveda blood-product transfusion. He had no historyof fever, anorexia, malaise, nausea, or abdominalpain. He consumed alcohol almost every week-end and used no medications other than the ac-etaminophen prescribed eight days before admis-sion. He was an office worker and had nottraveled outside the New York metropolitan areasince his arrival. He lived with his wife and chil-dren. His family history was unremarkable.This history increases the likelihood of viral hep-atitis, possibly reactivated, and alcoholic liver diseasemaking drug-induced and parasitic liver diseaseless plausible. Further laboratory investigation is re-quired to identify the hepatobiliary process and pos-sibly reveal its cause.No hepatitis B surface or e antigens were detect-ed. Tests revealed IgG antibodies to hepatitis Bcore antigen, but not to hepatitis B surface ore antigen, hepatitis A virus, cytomegalovirus, orhepatitis C virus. The results of a serologic screen-ing for Epstein-Barr virus were consistent withpast exposure. Tests for IgM antibodies to hepati-tis B core antigen were negative, as were tests forantinuclear antibody. An abdominal ultrasono-gram revealed mild splenomegaly and normal liv-er, pancreas, and extrahepatic biliary ducts. Atechnetium Tc 99m mebrofenin (Choletec) studyshowed a functional and patent gallbladder andcommon bile duct. Computed tomography (CT)of the abdomen showed mild hepatosplenomegalywith a homogeneous parenchymal appearance.Contrast enhancement disclosed no focal lesions.46January 1, 1998The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Blood cultures were nega-tive after five days.Extrahepatic obstruction and metastatic liver dis-ease were ruled out, and an unresolved hepatitis Binfection has emerged as a possible cause of hepatitisB together with bingeing on alcohol. However, thespontaneous arrest of the hepatic process concur-rently with the continued fever, the normocytic ane-mia, and the splenic enlargement make me con-cerned about an additional, systemic process, such asendocarditis or tuberculosis. We should rememberthat the anti-hepatitis B core antibody has beensuggested as a surrogate marker for human immu-nodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.1Intracutaneous tests with purified protein de-rivative and screening for delayed hypersensitivi-ty were negative. New sets of blood cultures wereundertaken to test for fastidious organisms andmycobacteria. A transthoracic echocardiogramshowed no valvular vegetations or intracardiacmass. A blood smear was negative for parasites.The patient refused to undergo HIV testing,claiming that he had no risk factors for exposure.Despite remittent fever (temperature, up to40°C), he continued to feel well, to be coherent,and to have a good appetite. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 97 mm per hour.At this point in the third week of illness, classic fe-ver of unknown origin could be used as a templatefor the organization of further diagnostic plans. In-fections are the commonest cause of fever of un-known origin.2 In view of the absence of a historyof environmental exposure, the most likely conta-gious causes of prolonged fever and splenomegalywere ruled out. Disorders of immunoregulation andmalignant conditions should be assessed next. Nev-ertheless, in this young, sexually active man, the pos-sibility of HIV infection cannot be ruled out. Suchinfection may both have fever as a presenting signand cause fever by means of secondary infections orlymphoproliferative tumors. The finding of cutane-ous anergy in the presence of hyperglobulinemia incombination with the splenomegaly, normocyticanemia, and antibodies against hepatitis B core an-tigen further strengthens the possibility of HIV in-fection. These points should be carefully shared withthe patient with the objective of obtaining his con-sent for HIV testing.The possibility of HIV infection was discussedwith the patient. He had been married morethan seven years. He firmly denied ever havinghad homosexual intercourse or extramarital sexpartners or using intravenous drugs. His wifeand four-year-old and seven-year-old childrenwere healthy. Several of his very close friendslived next door and were homosexual, and mosthad the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome(AIDS). He socialized with them regularly andusually accompanied them to their doctor visitsto act as an interpreter. On the basis of this ex-perience, he claimed to be familiar with themodes of transmission of HIV and with theavailability of potent new drug combinations.He still refused to be tested for HIV infection,however, stating that he had no risk factors andthat he was confident that HIV was not thecause of his illness.The patient's reasoning does not weaken my sus-picion of a possible HIV infection. Even if his closeinvolvement with his gay friends is unrelated to thehypotonia of his anal sphincter, he could have beeninfected through casual sex in the decade precedinghis marriage. Furthermore, HIV infection could ex-plain all the abnormal laboratory findings as well asthe persistent fever. The diagnostic importance ofthis test must be well explained, since seropositivitywould shift the investigative focus from an exhaus-tive checklist of possible causes to a targeted explo-ration for a lymphoproliferative tumor.3The patient was reexamined thoroughly. Hehad no enlarged lymph nodes, skin lesions, orophthalmologic abnormalities. Cultures of blood,urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and bone marrow werenegative for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi.Serologic tests for syphilis, Histoplasma capsu-latum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Toxoplasma gon-dii, and Borrelia burgdorferi were negative. Aperipheral-blood smear showed polychromasia,anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, microcytosis, and hy-pochromia, with 2 percent reticulocytes. The se-rum iron concentration was 19 mg per deciliter,the iron-binding capacity was 193 mg per deci-liter, the serum ferritin concentration was 1860ng per milliliter, the folic acid concentration was3.3 ng per milliliter, the vitamin B12 concentra-tion was 417 pg per milliliter, and the erythro-poietin concentration was 83 mU per milliliter.IgM antibodies to parvovirus B19 were not de-tected. Hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed 95percent hemoglobin A, 3.4 percent hemoglobinA2, and 1.2 percent fetal hemoglobin. A biopsyof the bone marrow revealed hypercellular mar-row with increased numbers of erythrocytes andmyelocytes, without evidence of infection or ma-lignant infiltration. Serum protein electrophore-sis showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.Volume 338 Number 147The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Whole-Body Nuclear Scan, Showing Emission fromthe Left Gluteal Region 24 Hours after the Injection of GalliumCitrate Ga 67.Analysis of peripheral-blood T-lymphocyte sub-groups showed 26 percent CD4+ cells (592 cellsper cubic millimeter) and 37 percent CD8+ cells(843 cells per cubic millimeter), with a ratio ofCD4+ cells to CD8+ cells of 0.7.The patient continued to feel generally welldespite a continual high-grade fever that occa-sionally necessitated cooling blankets. He wasgetting tired of being in the hospital and havingdaily tests. He was eager to leave the hospital andspend the year-end holidays with his family.This extensive investigation leaves us with no newdiagnostic directions, instead of confirming that asystemic process has been involving the reticulo-endothelial and immune systems. I would encouragethe patient to consent to HIV testing, reiteratingthat this could avert the need for even more testsand potentially lead to an intervention that will re-lieve his symptoms.The potential benefits of determining hisHIV-infection status were discussed with the pa-tient in detail. He persisted in his refusal to betested, insisting that HIV was not the cause ofhis symptoms and that such testing could divertthe medical evaluation away from the actualcause of the fever. A whole-body scan disclosedmarked uptake of gallium citrate Ga 67 in alarge, poorly defined area of the left buttock24 hours after the injection (Fig. 1). Increasedgallium uptake was not seen in the lungs, me-diastinum, abdomen, retroperitoneal area, orbones.The gallium scan was conducted to identify a lo-calized abscess, osteomyelitis, a lymphoma, or otherinfectious or neoplastic processes. Nonetheless, anabnormality in the gluteal region was an unexpectedfinding. Because gallium scans can have false positiveresults in the evaluation of fever, and since the pre-test probability of this gluteal abnormality was low,we have to keep in mind that the result could be afalse positive one.5The patient denied having any symptoms orinjury in the gluteal area. Examination of this re-gion revealed no skin changes, tenderness, de-formity, or signs of inflammation or injury. Thehigh intensity of the gallium emission remainedunchanged at 48 and 72 hours.These findings force us to consider that he mighthave a deeply seated soft-tissue tumor. However, theanergy, splenomegaly, and inverse CD4:CD8 ratiostill require explanation. If HIV infection was present,the unusual location of gallium uptake could repre-sent a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which in patientswith HIV is commonly extranodal and may befound at almost any site. The area should be furtherevaluated with a CT scan, and a tissue sample shouldbe obtained.At this point the patient admitted that he hadbeen seropositive for HIV for eight years. He de-manded that this information be kept secret bythe treating physician, without notation in themedical record or notification of the nursingstaff or his family. Combination therapy with zi-dovudine, lamivudine, and saquinavir was start-ed. A CT scan of the pelvis demonstrated hyper-trophic tumefaction in the left gluteus maximusmuscle, with a complete loss of the tissue planesthat define the muscle groups of the buttock. Atranscutaneous biopsy was performed with CTguidance.On the fourth day of treatment, the fever abat-ed. A CT scan of the pelvis demonstrated hyper-trophic tumefaction in the left gluteus maximusmuscle, with a complete loss of the tissue planesthat define the muscle groups of the buttock. Atranscutaneous biopsy was performed with CTguidance.\\n\",\n",

The most recent assessment of viral burden revealed a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 RNAlevel of 62,000 copies per milliliter. In September 1996, Cryptococcus neoformans infection had been diagnosed on thebasis of blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures (cerebrospinal fluid findings: glucose, 55 mg per deciliter [3.1 mmol perliter]; protein, 17 mg per deciliter; 6 red cells; and 0 white cells). The patient received a cumulative dose of 4.5 g ofintravenous amphotericin B but declined maintenance therapy. Subsequent blood cultures were negative, and serum cryp-tococcal antigen titers remained above 1:2000 without signs of meningitis. By May 1997, the serum creatinine concen-tration had gradually risen from 1.7 to 5.8 mg per deciliter (150 to 513 µmol per liter) and the 24-hour urinary proteinexcretion was 2.5 g.

EBELING, Assistant Editor\\nCase 13-1999\\nPRESENTATION OF CASE\\nA 20-year-old woman was admitted to the hospi-\\ntal because of chronic right otitis media.\\nThe patient had been well until one year earlier,\\nwhen a \"bad cold\" developed, with a sore throat.\\nThe sore throat subsided after one week, but nasal\\ncongestion and the sensation that her ears were\\nblocked persisted for a month. A physician made a\\ndiagnosis of sinusitis and prescribed a nasal spray\\nand an unknown antibiotic. The left ear became\\nclear, but the right ear remained symptomatic. Treat-\\nment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole provoked\\na rash and was discontinued, and a third antibiotic\\nwas ineffective. Painless drainage from the right ear\\ndeveloped, with diminished hearing. An audiomet-\\nric examination revealed loss of conductive hearing\\nin the right ear. The patient had a purulent nasal dis-\\ncharge and postnasal drip during the rest of the year.\\nThree months before admission, a computed tomo-\\ngraphic (CT) scan of the temporal bones (Fig. 1)\\nshowed opacification of the right middle ear and\\nmastoid bone, without erosion of the scutum, ossic-\\nular chain, or otic capsule. The external canal, the\\ncontour of the posterior nasopharynx, and the visi-\\nble portions of the paranasal sinuses appeared nor-\\nmal. Insertion of a tympanostomy tube did not im-\\nprove hearing and was followed by a perforation that\\ninvolved 30 percent of the eardrum.\\nEvaluation of the patient at the Massachusetts Eye\\nand Ear Infirmary a month before admission re-\\nvealed a perforation in the inferior portion of the\\nright tympanic membrane. Inspissated white materi-\\nal that filled the middle ear appeared to be solid\\ngranulation tissue. A Rinne test was normal. The left\\near was normal.

Both eustachian tubes\\nappeared to be occluded by mucosal swelling; the\\nmucosa of the right tube was pale white. There was\\nno evidence of facial-nerve weakness or spontaneous\\nnystagmus.\\nRoutine laboratory tests were normal except that\\nthe erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 32 mm per\\nhour. A test for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibod-\\nies (ANCA) was negative. Microscopical examina-\\ntion of stained smears of material from the right ear\\ncanal showed no neutrophils, acid-fast bacilli, or other\\nbacteria, and cultures yielded only Staphylococcus epi-\\ndermidis. Prednisone (20 mg daily) was prescribed,\\nbut the patient\\'s condition did not improve.\\nAt a follow-up examination 19 days later, a crust\\nin the deep portion of the ear canal was removed,\\nand granular changes were observed along the han-\\ndle of the malleus. Radiographs of the chest (Fig. 2)\\nshowed a curvilinear opacity in the right upper lung\\nthat was consistent with the presence of a scar. The\\nlungs were otherwise clear, and the cardiomediasti-\\nnal silhouette and bony structures appeared normal.\\nThe patient had grown up in a large city in China.\\nShe had had viral hepatitis A at nine years of age. An\\nuncle and a grandfather had been treated for pulmo-\\nnary infections when she was a child, but she did not\\nknow the diagnosis. She believed that she might\\nhave received bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vac-\\ncine in childhood. She immigrated to the United\\nStates at the age of 15 years. Two years before ad-\\nmission, a tuberculin skin test was positive; a subse-\\nquent chest radiograph showed normal findings. No\\ntreatment was administered. There was no history of\\nrecent fever, sweats, ear pain, or weight loss.\\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital, where\\nthe results of a physical examination were normal ex-\\ncept for the findings in the head.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. DAVID M. VERNICK*: May we review the ra-\\ndiologic findings?\\nDR. JAMES D. RABINOV: Bone windows of the ax-\\nial CT images show that the mastoid air cells are well\\nformed but opacified (Fig. 1). The right middle ear\\nis also opacified, but the ossicles are intact. There is\\nno evidence of bone destruction or demineralization\\non either the axial or coronal CT study.\\nThe chest film shows a small scar in the right up-\\nper lobe (Fig. 2). The hilar structures are normal,\\nand there is no pleural effusion.\\nDR. VERNICK: Patients with chronic or recurrent\\near drainage are often seen by otologists. Most pa-\\ntients with this disorder have a hole in the eardrum\\nand a bacterial infection in the middle ear, with pu-\\nrulent, often malodorous drainage. After a history\\nhas been taken and a physical examination performed,\\nthe initial intervention involves cleaning out the\\ndrainage from the ear and providing the patient with\\nappropriate antibiotic medication to be administered\\nboth orally and locally in the form of ear drops. The\\ninitial choice of antibiotics is usually empirical, with\\na drug chosen that is effective against the two patho-\\ngens most commonly associated with chronic or re-\\ncurrent ear drainage: staphylococcus and pseudomo-\\nnas. Follow-up examination of patients is necessary\\nto monitor the response to antibiotic therapy.\\nWhen medication fails to eradicate the infection,\\nan effort must be made to determine the cause of\\nthe treatment failure. The patient\\'s medical history\\nshould be reviewed for any systemic illnesses that\\ncould affect the ear. The findings in the ear should be\\nreevaluated. Is an underlying cholesteatoma present?\\nCulture of the discharge should be screened for\\natypical infectious agents and resistant strains of bac-\\nteria. Uncommon causes of chronic otorrhea should\\nbe considered. Radiographic imaging of the ear\\nusually CT scanning should be performed to\\nevaluate the extent of the disease and the status of\\nthe bony framework. Audiometry should be per-\\nformed to assess the severity of the damage.\\nMost infectious causes of chronic ear drainage\\n(Table 1) are bacterial.1,2 When the middle ear is in-\\nfected, the mastoid cavity also becomes involved,\\nsince it is directly continuous with the middle ear.\\n*Associate surgeon, Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital and Beth Israel\\nDeaconess Medical Center; assistant professor of otolaryngology, Harvard\\nMedical School all in Boston.\\n1350\\nApril 29, 1999\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

CAUSES OF CHRONIC OTORRHEA.\\nInfection\\nBacterial\\nMycobacterial\\nFungal\\nViral\\nDrainage of cerebrospinal fluid\\nTraumatic\\nSpontaneous\\nForeign body\\nTumor\\nCholesteatoma\\nBenign neoplasm\\nMalignant neoplasm\\nSystemic illness\\nWegener\\'s granulomatosis\\nOther\\nSystemically administered antibiotics are therefore\\nnecessary. Failure of the infection to disappear after\\nappropriate antibiotic therapy has been administered\\nindicates that the infectious agent is resistant to the\\nantibiotic chosen or that the otorrhea is not due to\\na bacterial infection. Culture of a specimen of the dis-\\ncharge, preferably obtained a day or two after all med-\\nication has been stopped, can help direct further ther-\\napy. Aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal cultures should\\nbe performed, accompanied by sensitivity testing. Cul-\\ntures for mycobacteria should be performed if the\\nclinical picture suggests that they may be the causa-\\ntive organisms. Viral infections of the ear have been\\nreported infrequently.\\nCerebrospinal fluid otorrhea may occur after trau-\\nma, such as a fracture of the temporal bone or an\\noperation, or may develop spontaneously in rare cas-\\nes. The discharge is clear and can be profuse. The\\near otherwise looks normal. Measurement of the glu-\\ncose level in the cerebrospinal fluid or, when neces-\\nsary, performance of a beta2-transferrin assay, can\\nhelp confirm the diagnosis. In difficult cases, an as-\\nsay of the otorrhea can be performed after injection\\nof a radionuclide or fluorescein into the cerebrospi-\\nnal fluid.\\nA foreign body in the ear canal or middle ear can\\nresult in chronic otorrhea. Unless the foreign body\\nhas been removed, medical therapy is usually inef-\\nfective. This diagnosis should be suggested by the\\nhistory, as well as the presence of a discrete area of\\ninfection.\\nTumors of the ear can become secondarily infect-\\ned, with chronic or recurrent otorrhea as the initial\\nmanifestation.1,4 Cholesteatoma, a cutaneous cyst in\\nthe middle ear, is by far the most common of these\\ntumors. Malignant neoplasms such as squamous-cell\\ncarcinoma and, in rare cases, benign neoplasms may\\nhave moist surfaces and become secondarily infect-\\ned. A biopsy is necessary to make the diagnosis\\nwhen a tumor other than cholesteatoma is suspect-\\ned. If such a tumor is present, the CT scan may\\nshow bony erosion.\\nSystemic illnesses such as Wegener\\'s granulomato-\\nsis can cause obstruction of the eustachian tube in\\nthe nasopharynx, resulting in chronic otorrhea.1 The\\nresults of a general physical examination performed\\nbefore one focuses on the ear may strongly suggest\\nthis diagnosis. Examination of the nose and naso-\\npharynx may show granular mucosal changes sug-\\ngestive of Wegener\\'s granulomatosis.\\nIn the case under discussion, the laboratory data\\nwere not very helpful, with stained smears and cul-\\ntures showing only S. epidermidis, a common organ-\\nism in the ear. Despite a negative ANCA test, pred-\\nnisone was administered, but it was ineffective. Since\\nthe diagnostic approach was unrevealing, further eval-\\nuation was necessary. A biopsy of the middle-ear tis-\\nsue, with both histologic examination and culture\\nof specimens, should have been the diagnostic pro-\\ncedure.\\nThe tubercle bacillus was discovered by Koch in\\n1882. The following year it was isolated from a mid-\\ndle-ear lesion.5,6 It has been estimated that early in\\nthis century, half the cases of suppurative otitis media\\nin children under one year of age and 27 percent of\\nthe cases in children under two years of age were\\ncaused by this bacillus. Three to 5 percent of all cases\\nof chronic otitis media were tuberculous.1,7 The tu-\\nbercle bacillus, which was often transmitted in unpas-\\nteurized milk, spread to the middle ear through the\\neustachian tube. In patients with pulmonary tubercu-\\nlosis, infection of the middle ear was thought to occur\\nby a hematogenous route. In patients with a middle\\near communicating with the outer ear, direct spread\\nthrough the ear canal occasionally occurred.8-10\\nSince the introduction of antituberculosis therapy,\\npasteurization of milk, and BCG vaccination, the\\nfrequency of middle-ear tuberculosis has become so\\nlow in this country that there are only a few case re-\\nports in the literature.11,12 Because of the paucity of\\nteaching cases, many physicians do not consider this\\ndisease, and their clinical experience with it is too\\nlimited to make them familiar with the characteristic\\nphysical findings.\\nTextbook descriptions of aural tuberculosis in-\\nclude painless otorrhea, which is usually profuse,\\nwith multiple perforations of the tympanic mem-\\nbrane and preauricular lymphadenopathy.1,2,4,10,11,13-15\\nFacial palsy and hearing loss have been reported fre-\\nquently, and granulation tissue has been present in\\nmany cases. Bezold\\'s abscess (an abscess of the mas-\\ntoid tip), systemic symptoms, and especially pulmo-\\nnary symptoms have been reported. Central nervous\\nsystem involvement is rare, probably because the\\ndura serves as a protective barrier.\\nVolume 340 Number 17\\n1351\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

All rights reserved.\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\\nRecent reports of middle-ear tuberculosis present\\na different picture.7,8,11,16-18 A single perforation of\\nthe tympanic membrane is common. In some cases,\\nthe eardrum disappears, exposing the malleus and\\nsometimes the promontory of the middle ear. Con-\\nductive hearing loss usually occurs; without treat-\\nment, it can progress to profound sensorineural loss.\\nGranulation tissue in the middle ear is usually pale\\ninstead of beefy red. The exudate in the middle ear\\nmay be thick and is sometimes confused with the in-\\nfected keratin debris of a cholesteatoma. Periauricu-\\nlar fistulas, lymphadenopathy, and facial palsy are in-\\nfrequent findings.17,18\\nRadiologic findings are often nonspecific.19,20 Bony\\nerosion is uncommon, but demineralization of the\\nbone has been reported. The diagnosis of the infec-\\ntion rests on identification of the organism by means\\nof culture or histologic studies. Unfortunately, cul-\\nture of the discharge has a low yield.16 Biopsy of the\\ngranulation tissue, with histologic examination as well\\nas culture of the tissue, has the best results. The dis-\\nease is treated mainly with antituberculosis medica-\\ntion, usually a multidrug regimen. Surgery may have\\na role in the resolution of the disease but is not cur-\\native by itself, and its contribution is unclear.10,16,17,21\\nOperations to repair damage to the middle ear and\\neardrum should be delayed until the infection has\\nbeen eradicated.\\nSeveral features of the history should be consid-\\nered in this case. The patient grew up in a large city\\nin China, a country where tuberculosis is much\\nmore common than it is in the United States. Mem-\\nbers of the patient\\'s family had pulmonary infections\\nthat may have been tuberculous. She had a positive\\ntuberculin skin test, a finding related either to BCG\\nvaccination or to undiagnosed tuberculosis. She had\\ndrainage from the ear for a year that was unrespon-\\nsive to multiple antibiotic regimens. The granulation\\ntissue in the middle ear was white. The radiographs\\nshowed no bony erosion and no abnormalities in the\\nparanasal sinuses or nasopharynx. Laboratory tests\\nwere normal.\\nThe course of this patient\\'s illness is not typical of\\na chronic bacterial otitis. It did not respond to anti-\\nbiotics. The absence of radiologic evidence of in-\\nvolvement of the paranasal sinuses or nasopharynx\\nand the negative ANCA test are evidence against the\\ndiagnosis of Wegener\\'s granulomatosis.\\nThe patient underwent a diagnostic procedure. I\\nexpect that this was a biopsy of the middle-ear tis-\\nsue, the results of which should have confirmed the\\ndiagnosis of tuberculosis.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Dr. Staecker, as the sur-\\ngeon who saw this patient, will you comment?\\nDR. HINRICH STAECKER: It was clear that this pa-\\ntient\\'s presentation was not characteristic of chronic\\notitis media. Our differential diagnosis included both\\nWegener\\'s granulomatosis and mycobacterial infec-\\ntion. We performed an ANCA test, although we re-\\nalized that the result is negative in 15 percent of cas-\\nes of localized Wegener\\'s granulomatosis, and we\\nobtained specimens for culture from the ear canal.\\nSince the cultures were unrevealing, we treated the\\npatient presumptively with prednisone and made\\nplans for a definitive biopsy. A simple mastoidecto-\\nmy, excision of granulation tissue, and tympanoplas-\\nty were performed. Specimens were sent to the pa-\\nthology department for examination and to the\\nmicrobiology laboratory for aerobic, anaerobic, fun-\\ngal, and mycobacterial cultures.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\nTuberculosis of the middle ear, probable.\\n? Wegener\\'s granulomatosis, localized.\\nDR. DAVID M. VERNICK\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nTuberculosis of the middle ear.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. SUZANNE B. KEEL: Intraoperative examina-\\ntion of frozen sections showed amorphous, necrotic\\nmaterial. Examination of the permanent sections re-\\nvealed that almost all the tissue was necrotic. A small\\namount of preserved, edematous middle-ear tissue\\ncontained an infiltrate composed of lymphocytes,\\nplasma cells, and foci of histiocytes (Fig. 3 and 4).\\nNo caseating granulomas were seen. Necrosis and\\ninflammation were present adjacent to a small nerve,\\nand fragments of dead bone were embedded in ne-\\ncrotic tissue. There were also areas of fibrosis. Ziehl-\\nNeelsen staining demonstrated clusters of red acid-\\nfast bacilli within the necrotic tissue (Fig. 4, inset).\\nCultures of the nasopharynx yielded Mycobacterium\\ntuberculosis.\\nLess than 0.1 percent of cases of otitis media and\\nmastoiditis are caused by M. tuberculosis.22 In a study\\nreported in 1986, tuberculous otitis media in adults\\nwas associated with M. tuberculosis infection else-\\nwhere in the body in 58 percent of the cases,11 but\\nthe increasing numbers of immunocompromised per-\\nsons infected with M. tuberculosis may have changed\\nthis percentage. The prevalence of tuberculous otitis\\nmedia with another identified site of infection is\\nonly 0.2 to 0.7 percent. Staining of the biopsy spec-\\nimen for acid-fast organisms is important, since it\\nmay result in identification of the bacilli weeks be-\\nfore cultures become positive, and prompt therapy\\nmay salvage the patient\\'s hearing.\\nDR. MARK: Dr. Durand, you were the consultant\\nfor the Infectious Disease Service. Will you tell us\\nabout this patient\\'s treatment?\\nDR. MARLENE L. DURAND: We administered a\\nfour-drug regimen of antituberculosis therapy ini-\\ntially.

He was treated initially with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and rifampin. A Gram's stain of the cerebrospinal fluid showed gram-positive organisms in pairs and short chains, but cultures of cerebrospinal fluid were negative. A latex-agglutination test was positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae. During the next several days, disseminated intravascular coagulation and symmetric areas of pallor developed on the back of both hands and the soles of the feet, with overlying bullae. Cultures of the bullous fluid were sterile. The lesions progressed to dry gangrene (Panels A and B). All blood cultures remained negative. The patient was treated with antibiotics for four weeks.

She was referred by an ophthalmic clinical officer from a district hospital for exenteration of the left eye because of an ocular tumour.\\n\\nThe first symptoms started 8 months prior when she noticed a whitish lesion growing on the conjunctiva of her left eye. She presented at a health centre and was prescribed non- specified eye drops. Yet, over the following months the lesion grew bigger and turned reddish. She went to a traditional healer who prescribed herbal eye drops, which did not help either. The lesion grew constantly bigger and she finally lost her eyesight in the affected eye. Pain also increased which made her present at her local district hospital.\\n\\nThe patient is known to be HIV-positive. She has been on antiretroviral treatment for the past 3 years. The CD4 count is unknown.\\n\\nClinical Findings\\nLocalized swelling of the left eyeball and orbit, lid closure incomplete (Fig. 43.1). The visual acuity on the right side is 6/6, whereas the left eye has no light perception. Her left preauricular lymph nodes are swollen. She is afebrile and the rest of her physical examination is unremarkable.\\n\\nQuestions\\n1. What is the suspected diagnosis?\\n2. How would you manage the patient?\\n\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow Would You Manage this Patient?\\n\\nThe patient should be started on analgesic treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. She should be counselled and booked for surgery. An extended exenteration of the left eyeball and orbit should be done. Control of the patient's HIV infection is crucial, and her HIV viral load should be checked.\\n\\nBecause the patient has lost her eyesight on the left side, the right eye should be carefully examined for possible growth of another OSSN that could be removed at an early stage. A fundoscopy should be performed in order to detect any abnormalities, especially an upcoming cytomegalovirus infection.\\n\\nThe Case Continued...\\n\\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital and counselled several times about the need for surgery. Yet she refused surgical intervention and was only willing to accept conservative treatment.\\n\\nThe patient's left orbit was covered with antibiotics and bandaged. When pain was sufficiently controlled, the patient was discharged with the offer to come back at any time.\\n\\nShe was asked to report to her antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic for control of the viral load and possible switch of her antiretroviral therapy.\",\n",

The fever occurs mainly\\nin the afternoon hours accompanied by chills and sometimes\\nconvulsions. Between the febrile episodes she was initially\\nfine and played normally. However, over time she has devel-\\noped progressive anorexia, dry cough, chest pain, joint and\\nback pain.\\nShe has never been admitted to a hospital, but she has pre-\\nsented at another clinic recently where she received some\\nunspecified tablets that did not bring any improvement.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe girl is alert and pale, but not jaundiced. She is severely\\nmalnourished (Z-score <3). Her vital signs are: temperature\\n39.6°C (103.3°F), pulse 96bpm, blood pressure 100/\\n60 mmHg. Her chest sounds clear; normal heart sounds; soft\\nabdomen with a splenomegaly of 4 cm below the left costal\\nmargin.

On examination she is pale and severely malnour-\\nished. She has splenomegaly and generalized lymphadenop-\\nathy. The full blood count (FBC) shows pancytopenia.\\nSerological rapid diagnostic tests for malaria, brucellosis\\nand visceral leishmaniasis are negative.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Are Your Most Important Differential\\nDiagnoses?\\nChronic fever, splenomegaly and wasting in a child from\\nSouth Sudan should raise the suspicion of visceral leishman-\\niasis or brucellosis. Tuberculosis and HIV infection both\\nneed to be ruled out, because they can cause chronic fever,\\nanorexia, weight loss, splenomegaly and generalized\\nlymphadenopathy.\\nMalaria can cause fever, anaemia and splenomegaly, but\\ntwo different negative tests make this unlikely. In addition,\\nthe chronic fever is unusual; in a child one might expect a\\nmore acute course. Furthermore, malaria does not cause\\nany lymphadenopathy. Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly\\nsyndrome (HMS) has been described in children. It can\\ncause gross splenomegaly and anaemia in regions hyperen-\\ndemic for malaria, but HMS does not present with a fever,\\nneither is lymphadenopathy part of the picture.\\n121\\n122 CHAPTER 44 A 7-Year-Old Girl from South Sudan With Undulating Fever\\nTyphoid fever can present with persistent fever and\\nsplenomegaly; a dry cough is also common. The duration\\nof fever in this case may be slightly too long though, and gen-\\neralized lymphadenopathy is not a common feature of\\ntyphoid.\\nA splenic abscess could cause chronic fever and spleno-\\nmegaly, but would not explain the generalized lymphade-\\nnopathy and the haematological changes, unless the\\npatient was acutely septic.\\nChronic schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma mansoni\\ninfection can cause splenomegaly in the context of portal\\nhypertension, but patients would not be febrile and lymph-\\nadenopathy is not part of the picture either.\\nMalignancies like leukaemia and lymphoma should be\\nruled out.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow Would You Approach this Patient?\\nThe little girl appears very sick and should be admitted to the\\nhospital. The list of differential diagnoses is long and there\\nare many tests that would be requested if the same patient\\npresented in an affluent setting.\\nIn a resource-constrained place like South Sudan, a prag-\\nmatic clinical approach is necessary. The history should be\\ntaken as accurately as possible to narrow down the differen-\\ntial diagnosis. One should try to find out if the patient comes\\nfrom an area where visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic.\\nFor possible HIV infection, it would be of great importance\\nto find out if the parents and siblings are alive and well; and\\nenquiries should be made if there are any close contacts who\\nare suspected to have TB or who have a history of recent TB\\ntreatment.\\nThe clinician has to cope with the investigations available,\\nwhich may commonly not be in line with the internationally\\nrecommended standards. Gold standard for diagnosis of VL\\nis the proof of the parasite in tissue specimens. However, this\\nis often not feasible under field conditions and serological\\ntests are used instead. The rapid antigen test for VL\\n(rK39) used in this case was negative (sensitivity of this test\\nin South Sudan is 85-90%).\\nBecause VL is high on the list of differential diagnoses, a\\nsecond serological test such as the Direct Agglutination Test\\n(DAT) should be done, and direct proof of the parasite\\nshould be attempted.\\nSensitivity is highest for splenic aspirates (93–99%), fol-\\nlowed by bone marrow (53–86%) and lymph node aspira-\\ntion (53-65%), which can be further increased by culture\\nand PCR. Splenic aspiration is complicated with life-\\nthreatening haemorrhages in about 0.1% of procedures\\nand therefore requires strict precautions, technical expertise\\nand postinterventional monitoring.\\nBlood cultures, if available, would be helpful for diagnosis\\nof typhoid fever, brucellosis and septicaemia.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe mother of the patient reported that the family came\\nfrom an area where visceral leishmaniasis was known. It\\nturned out that the uncle of the child had been treated for\\nVL before. The girl's sister had recently been treated for TB.\\nThe child's health continued to deteriorate. She had per-\\nsistently high fever and became increasingly pale.\\nThe DAT came back positive with a high titre\\n(≥1:6.400), which supported the suspected diagnosis of vis-\\nceral leishmaniasis.\\nConsidering her critical condition, with severe malnutri-\\ntion and progressive anaemia, the patient was started on lipo-\\nsomal amphotericin B and a broad-spectrum antibiotic\\n(ceftriaxone). The girl also received nutritional support with\\nhigh-energy/high-protein ready-to-use therapeutic food\\n(RUTF) and vitamin/mineral supplementation.\\nAfter 5 days, the fever settled and the patient started to\\nrecover. Two weeks later the girl had gained some weight\\nand was again able to walk and play.\\n• Fig. 44.1 A child is receiving liposomal amphotericin B on a paediatric\\nward in South Sudan.\\nVL is a vector-borne systemic parasitic infection caused by\\nLeishmania protozoans, most commonly L. donovani and L.\\ninfantum. Large epidemics have been described in East Africa\\nand the Indian subcontinent. As a result of efforts to eliminate the\\ndisease on the Indian subcontinent, the incidence of VL has\\ndecreased substantially in the past decade. Ninety per cent of all\\ncases occur in only five countries: India, Sudan, South Sudan,\\nEthiopia and Brazil.\\nTransmission can be anthroponotic or zoonotic, differing by\\nregion and parasite strain. Humans most commonly acquire VL\\nthrough the bite of an infected female sandfly, but other modes of\\ntransmission have been described.\\nCHAPTER 44 A 7-Year-Old Girl from South Sudan With Undulating Fever 123\\nLeishmania promastigotes invade cells of the human reticu-\\nloendothelial system where they metamorphose into amastigotes\\nand multiply. The incubation period varies greatly, from 10 days to\\nseveral years, but usually takes between 2 and 8 months.\\nThe clinical presentation depends on the infecting species, as\\nwell as on the host's genetic background and immune status.\\nMost infections remain asymptomatic.\\nClinical VL presents with symptoms and signs of a chronic\\nsystemic infection (fever, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss) and of\\nparasite invasion of the mononuclear phagocyte system (enlarged\\nlymph nodes, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly) resulting in severe\\nimmunosuppression. In India, hyperpigmentation has led to the\\nname 'kala-azar' (Hindi for 'black sickness'). VL is typically fatal if\\nnot treated, and potentially fatal complications include bacterial\\nsuperinfections and congestive heart failure because of severe\\nanaemia and haemorrhage.\\nIn low-resource settings, diagnostic options for VL are often\\nlimited. On FBC all three cell lines can be depleted. Demonstration\\nof Leishmania amastigotes in samples from bone marrow, spleen\\nand lymph node is the classic confirmatory test for VL. Under field\\nconditions, direct proof of the parasite is often not feasible, and\\nseveral serological tests have been developed instead. Sensitivity\\nand specificity of these tests generally vary and they should\\nalways be used in combination with a standardized case definition\\nas suggested by the WHO.\\nThe rK39 immuno-chromatographic test (ICT) and the direct\\nagglutination test (DAT) were found to have the highest sensitivity\\nand specificity. The rK39 ICTs are easy to perform, rapid\\n(10-20 minutes), cheap and give easily reproducible results. The\\nsemiquantitative DAT has a longer turnaround time of about\\n24 hours, and requires a laboratory with well-trained technicians.\\nTreatment of VL is complex: efficacy of the individual drugs\\nvaries geographically and depends on parasite susceptibility and\\nthe immune status of the patient. Parenteral drugs currently used\\nare pentavalent antimonials, paromomycin and (liposomal)\\namphotericin B (Fig. 44.1). The oral drug in use is miltefosine.\\nCombinations of antileishmanial drugs seem to help shorten\\ntherapy courses, reduce side effects, improve treatment out-\\ncomes, delay resistance development and reduce\\ntreatment costs.\\nIn HIV patients, VL is even more difficult to treat because it\\ndoes not respond well to the classic antileishmanial drugs and has\\na higher tendency to relapse.\\nFurther Reading\\n1.

       " '45\\nA 2-Month-Old Girl from Laos With\\nDyspnoea, Cyanosis and Irritability\\nMAYFONG MAYXAY, DOUANGDAO SOUKALOUN AND PAUL N. NEWTON\\n\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nYou are working in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU)\\nof a tertiary hospital in Vientiane, Laos. A 2-month-old baby\\ngirl is presented with 3 days of irritability, dyspnoea and\\ngrunting. Her mother is a 24-year-old rice farmer who\\ndescribes that the baby suddenly became unwell but was nei-\\nther feverish nor coughing. The infant was born at term and\\nhad been very well until 3 days previously.\\n\\nClinical Findings\\nIrritable infant, crying and grunting, with a temperature of\\n37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 140 bpm (normal range 100-\\n160), respiratory rate 40 breath cycles per minute (normal\\nrange 30-60). The blood pressure is not taken. The child\\nis dyspnoeic and has central cyanosis, hepatomegaly and\\noedematous extremities. The rest of the physical examination\\nappears normal, with a clear chest and no heart murmurs.\\n\\nQuestions\\n1. What are your most important differential diagnoses?\\n2. What additional information do you need to obtain from\\nthe mother and what would be your immediate\\nmanagement?\\n\\nDiscussion\\nA young Lao mother presents with her 2-month-old baby\\ngirl, who has been acutely unwell for the past 3 days. The\\nchild has been breastfeeding poorly and was noted to have\\nbeen grunting, which is a non-specific sign of severe systemic\\nillness in infants. On examination, the child is irritable, cya-\\nnosed and shows signs of heart failure.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Are Your Most Important Differential\\nDiagnoses?\\nThe most important differential diagnoses to consider are\\ncongenital heart disease, respiratory diseases (e.g. broncho-\\npneumonia, bronchiolitis and laryngitis), meningitis and\\ninfantile beriberi (thiamine or vitamin B₁ deficiency).\\nHowever, the absence of cough, wheeze and fever, along\\nwith a normal chest examination, suggest that respiratory dis-\\neases are unlikely. The fact that the cyanosis has started well\\nafter birth along with the sudden onset of symptoms and the\\nabsence of a heart murmur suggests that congenital heart dis-\\nease is unlikely. Absence of fever or bulging fontanels makes\\nmeningitis unlikely. \\n\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat Additional Information Do You Need to\\nObtain from the Mother and What Would be Your\\nImmediate Management?\\nThe most important information to be obtained from the\\nmother is whether the child has been exclusively breastfed,\\nwhether the mother had practiced food avoidance during\\npregnancy and/or post-partum, and whether the mother her-\\nself has had any symptoms and signs suggestive of beriberi,\\nsuch as paresthesias and difficulty rising from a squatting\\nposition.\\nProlonged food avoidance post-partum is common in\\nlowland Lao culture. It is based upon the traditional belief\\nthat certain food items may harm the newborn. Most low-\\nland mothers eat milled glutinous rice but avoid eating fruits\\nand vegetables, which results in low diet diversity for some\\nmonths before and after delivery.\\n\\nThiamine deficiency may be one result of such dietary\\nrestriction, and affected mothers secrete insufficient levels\\nof thiamine in their breastmilk. The cardiac form of thiamine\\ndeficiency usually manifests during the second or third\\nmonth of life. Infants present with dyspnoea, cyanosis,\\nvomiting and irritability.\\nChildren with infantile beriberi respond rapidly (i.e.\\nwithin 30-60 min) to intravenous or intramuscular thiamine\\n(50 mg), which should urgently be administered. The child\\nshould be closely monitored.\\n\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe mother reported that her child had been exclusively\\nbreastfed and that she had practiced food avoidance since\\ndelivery: She had avoided eating beef, pork, vegetables and\\nfruits. The mother said that she herself had anorexia, weak-\\nness, a husky voice, and paresthesias affecting her limbs –\\nsymptoms of thiamine deficiency.\\nIntravenous thiamine (50 mg) was given immediately to\\nthe child after admission and she quickly and dramatically\\nresponded. Six hours later the baby was able to breastfeed\\nnormally and was discharged the following day. Blood sam-\\nples were taken from the child and the mother. Analysis\\nshowed that both were thiamine-deficient.\\nThe mother was given oral thiamine supplementation and\\nadvised to return to a well-balanced diet including thiamine-\\nrich foods.\\n\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nInfantile Beriberi\\nInfantile beriberi, or clinical thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency in\\ninfants, is a largely forgotten, fatal but inexpensively treated dis-\\nease. It mainly occurs in South and South-east Asia, where 50 to\\n100 years ago it was recognized as a major public health problem.\\nIt remains relatively common in Laos, probably because of pro-\\nlonged maternal food avoidance during pregnancy and post-\\npartum. There is also evidence that it is still of importance in\\nCambodia, India and Myanmar, and cases have been reported\\nfrom refugee populations in Thailand.\\nInfantile beriberi occurs in exclusively breastfed babies of\\napproximately 2 to 3 months of age, whose mothers have thia-\\nmine deficiency resulting from inadequate thiamine intake.\\nIt commonly manifests mainly as the \"wet\" form of beriberi,\\ncharacterized by heart failure with hepatomegaly and marked\\nperipheral oedema. The disease typically presents as shock,\\noften preceded by a hoarse cry, grunting, poor breastfeeding,\\nirritability, dyspnoea and cyanosis. Clinically unapparent thiamine\\ndeficiency was also found to be common among sick infants\\nadmitted to the hospitals in Laos.\\nA thiamine-deficient diet is largely made up of milled, sticky rice\\nthat has had most of its thiamine removed as a result of the milling\\nprocess. In the late nineteenth century, the advent of mechanical\\nrice milling, which removes the main dietary source of thiamine in\\nthe rice husk, is thought to be the precipitant for beriberi\\nbecoming a major public health problem in Asia, responsible for\\nconsiderable mortality. However, there has been very little recent\\nepidemiological research, despite evidence that it remains focally\\nimportant.\\nThe pathophysiology of infantile beriberi remains unclear, but\\nthe cardinal problem is usually myocardial dysfunction. Thiamine\\ndeficiency may also present with a variety of other clinical syn-\\ndromes, including encephalopathy, hypoglycemia and lactic\\nacidosis.\\nInfantile beriberi is usually diagnosed clinically because of the\\nneed to act before biochemical results are available and the lack\\nof laboratories in endemic areas that can perform thiamine bio-\\nchemical assays. Treatment of infantile beriberi with thiamine is\\nsimple, inexpensive and highly effective. It should be administered\\nparenterally to rapidly increase tissue thiamine levels. Thiamine\\nsupplementation should also be given to the mothers of infants\\nwith beriberi. Education about thiamine-rich foods (e.g. pulses,\\ngroundnuts, whole wheat, fruits and vegetables) and on the\\ndanger of food avoidance should be provided before discharge.\\nPrevention is crucial: better understanding of post-partum diets,\\nand on how to change the practice of food avoidance is very\\nimportant and thiamine supplementation for mothers is\\nurgently needed.\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n1.

       " \"A 45-year-old Sri Lankan man presents to a local hospital with fever, chills, headache, body aches and severe right hypochondrial pain for the past week. He has also developed a dry cough during the past few days. He has vomited twice during his illness and has lost his appetite. His abdominal pain is constant and dull. It radiates to the right shoulder and is made worse when coughing and resting on the right side. The patient had been well before the current illness. He admits to consuming locally brewed alcohol (‘toddy', made of coconut flowers) daily for the past 10 to 15 years. The patient looks generally ill, mildly dehydrated and is in pain. Temperature is 38.3°C (100.8°F), blood pressure 100/80 mmHg, pulse 102bpm, respiratory rate 24 breath cycles per minute. There is no jaundice, no pallor and no lymphadenopathy. The abdominal examination reveals a tender hepatomegaly; however, the tenderness is most prominent over the 6th to 9th intercostal spaces in the right mid-axillary line. The spleen is not enlarged. On auscultation, there are few inspiratory crackles over the right lung base. The cardiovascular system and the nervous system are clinically normal. His laboratory results are shown in Table 46.1. WBC (×10⁹/L) 14.7, Haemoglobin (g/dL) 12.3, Platelets (×10⁹/L) 224, AST (U/L) 54, ALT (U/L) 38, ALP (U/L) 446, Serum bilirubin total (µmol/L) 10.3, Serum bilirubin direct (µmol/L) 1.5, Blood urea nitrogen (mmol/L) 7, Serum creatinine (µmol/L) 124, C-reactive protein (mg/L) 48. A chest radiograph showed elevated right hemidiaphragm and patchy shadows in the right lower zone. A 45-year-old Sri Lankan man presents with fever, headache, body aches and constant right-sided abdominal pain for a week. He also has a dry cough. His past medical history is unremarkable, but he consumes local alcohol. He is febrile with tender hepatomegaly and intercostal tenderness on the right. There is no jaundice. His blood results show very mildly elevated transaminases, an elevated alkaline phosphatase (AP) and raised inflammatory markers.\",\n",
       " 'A 32-Year-Old Man from Malawi With a Painfully Swollen Neck\\n\\nJOEP J. VAN OOSTERHOUT\\n\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 32-year-old Malawian man presents to the outpatient department of a local tertiary hospital with a 6-week history of productive cough and chest pain associated with weight loss, fevers and night sweats. He has also noticed that his neck has swollen and is painful. There are no other symp- toms. He has never been admitted to a hospital but has been tested HIV positive and was started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis 2 months earlier at a nearby health centre. His health passport (Fig. 47.1) reveals that a recent CD4 count was 95 cells/µL and that the patient had been treated for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum smear- negative pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago.\\n\\nClinical Findings\\nHe looks moderately ill, is pale, is sweating and has a temper- ature of 39.2°C (102.56°F), pulse 112bpm, respiratory rate 28 breath cycles per minute and normal blood pressure. There are large, matted lymph glands palpable in his neck. The rest of the examination is unremarkable.\\n\\nInvestigations\\nFull blood count: WBC 14.3×109/L (reference range: 4-10), haemoglobin 6.3 g/dL (13-15), MCV 66fL (80-98), platelets 246 × 10º/L (150–350).\\nThree sputum samples are negative for AFB. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a neck gland yields purulent material. Microscopy for AFB is 2+ positive. There is no growth on blood culture.\\n\\nInitial treatment\\nThe patient is admitted to the hospital and started on TB repeat treatment for tuberculous lymphadenitis with strepto- mycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, while continuing the same ART. Against expectation, he does not improve after 3 weeks. He still has fevers, night sweats, lack of appetite and the glands in the neck have fur- ther swollen and are now clearly fluctuant (Fig. 47.2).\\n\\nQuestions\\n1. What could be the reasons for the lack of clinical improvement?\\n2. Which investigations are indicated?\\n\\nDiscussion\\nA 32-year-old Malawian man who is known to be HIV pos- itive is admitted with a diagnosis of tuberculous lymphade- nitis and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) of the unmasking type (see Summary Box). The TB diagnosis is based on microscopic findings. He unexpect- edly deteriorates on antituberculous treatment.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Could Be the Reasons for the Lack of Clinical Improvement?\\nAlthough the diagnosis of TB lymphadenitis is very likely when AFB are identified in a lymph gland sample, atypical mycobacteria should also be considered now that the initial response to TB treatment is unsatisfactory, especially given the deep immune suppression the patient had at the start of ART. Other reasons for a poor response to TB treatment are non-adherence, malabsorption and drug resistance. Given the frank fluctuation that is present, a bacterial lymph- adenitis is probable, whereas a lymphoma seems much less likely.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhich Investigations Are Indicated?\\nHIV viral load and a CD4 count should be done to deter- mine the response to ART. A repeat FNA should be per- formed to check for AFB. A Gram stain and bacterial culture should help rule out bacterial superinfection. Ideally, the aspirate should be examined by PCR (XPert MTB/RIF) and also be cultured to rule out infection with resistant Myco- bacterium tuberculosis or atypical mycobacteria (culture).\\n\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe patient denied missing any tablets, had no diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, and had not left Malawi, where multi-drug resistance for TB is uncommon. IRIS of the paradoxical type was also considered to explain the lack of improvement (see Box), therefore corticosteroids were initiated.\\nFurther investigations were done, with the following results: CD4 109 cells/µL; HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL. Repeat FBC results were: WBC 7.8 × 10º/L, haemoglobin 6.7 g/dL, MCV 84 fL, platelets 428 × 10º/L.\\nBecause of the increasingly fluctuant swelling in the neck, a second FNA was done, now showing frank yellowish pus. On microscopic examination, numerous coccoid bacteria and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes were observed. Unfor- tunately results from a bacterial culture were never received.',\n",
       " \"A 31-year-old woman is referred to a hospital in northern Tanzania with a loss of power and feeling in her legs. She describes being perfectly well up until 2 days earlier when she felt acute back pain which radiated band-like to the level of her umbilicus. The pain was severe, continuous, burning and unrelieved by analgesics or position. Within 12 hours the pain had lessened but she developed numbness in her feet and legs ascending to the level of her waist, loss of power in her legs and loss of control of her bladder. There is a history of a febrile illness 3 weeks previously, treated as malaria. There is no past or family history of similar illness and no history of trauma. She is married with 3 children, the last born is 12 months old. She does not smoke or take alcohol, and her HIV status during her last pregnancy was negative. Clinically, she is well nourished with normal vital signs. General examination is unremarkable; there is no spinal tenderness, deformity or gibbus. On neurological examination she is fully orientated and higher mental functions appear normal. Cranial nerves including fundoscopy and upper limbs are normal. She is unable to move her legs and examination of the lower limbs reveals a flaccid paraparesis with a sensory level at T10. On inspection feet are in a slightly plantar-flexed position. Tone is reduced bilaterally, power is reduced (MRC grade 1/5) in all muscle groups. Reflexes are absent bilaterally, and plantar reflexes are extensor. Sensation is reduced to light touch to the level of the umbilicus. Joint position sense is impaired in the feet and ankles, and vibration sense is absent to the anterior iliac crest bilaterally. The clinical syndromic diagnosis is acute flaccid paraparesis. The main neuroanatomical differential diagnoses of flaccid paraparesis are lesions of peripheral nerves, including their roots (polyneuropathies or polyradiculoneuropathies), and acute lesions of the spinal cord (myelopathies). The sensory impairment up to the umbilicus (T10 level) and extensor plantar reflexes localise the site of the lesion to the spinal cord. The flaccidity and loss of reflexes can be explained by the early flaccid phase of acute spinal cord injury when spasticity appears days or weeks later. The patient's full blood count, renal and liver function tests were normal. Laboratory results on admission showed an ESR of 19 mm/h, negative HIV-Serology and p24 Antigen, negative VDRL, negative Schistosomiasis-serology, and negative urine and stool for ova of Schistosoma. A spinal tap was done. The CSF opening pressure was normal and looked clear. CSF results showed a white cell count of 11 cells/µl (90% lymphocytes), protein of 1.11 g/L, and negative stains and tests. The x-rays of her chest and thoracolumbar spine were normal. The main differential diagnosis of acute non-compressive flaccid paraparesis that localizes in the spinal cord is acute spinal cord inflammation (acute transverse myelitis), and vascular spinal cord ischaemia (“spinal stroke”). The CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein level are suggestive of inflammation in the spinal cord.\",\n",

He had eaten a local dessert\\nthe previous day without realizing that it was made of\\nreduced milk and had experienced some bloating and dis-\\ncomfort, but was otherwise feeling much better.\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nGiardiasis\\nGiardiasis is caused by Giardia intestinalis (also called G. lamblia),\\na flagellate protozoan. The parasite is present throughout the\\nworld, with several species found in animals. Not all infections\\nresult in symptoms, particularly in tropical countries where local\\npopulations with constant exposure rarely develop disease.\\nSymptomatic giardiasis is common in travellers to regions of\\nSouth and South-east Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin\\nAmerica, particularly where clean water supplies and standards of\\nfood hygiene are low.\\nGiardia trophozoites are found in the small intestine of\\nhumans, and these non-invasive parasites appear to cause\\ndiarrhoea by blocking the absorptive surfaces of the gut and\\npossibly by inducing fluid secretion. The trophozoites produce an\\nenvironmentally resistant form, the cyst, which is passed in stool\\nand enters the soil, water, food, or other surfaces after bowel\\nmovements. The most common method of infection is by drinking\\ncontaminated water. However, people may also become infected\\nthrough hand-to-mouth transmission. This involves eating\\ncontaminated food or touching contaminated surfaces and\\nunknowingly swallowing the parasite. The signs and symptoms of\\ngiardiasis usually occur within 7 to 14 days of exposure. Symp-\\ntoms include diarrhoea, pale greasy stools, stomach cramps,\\ngas, nausea, vomiting, bloating, weight loss and weakness. The\\nsymptoms usually last for 1 to 2 weeks, but may last longer.\\nGiardiasis can cause malabsorption of vitamin A, vitamin B12, iron,\\nfat and carbohydrates in up to 20-40% of patients. Malabsorption\\ncan sometimes be prolonged and take several weeks to disap-\\npear. Chronic and multiple infections in young children have been\\nshown to cause long-term effects on growth leading to stunting.\\nThe most common treatment is administration of drugs of the\\nnitroimidazole group, with tinidazole being the drug of choice\\nfollowed by metronidazole. Tinidazole is effective as a single dose\\nof 2g, and metronidazole 500mg is given tds for 5 to 7 days. Non-\\nresponsiveness to nitroimidazole treatment is increasingly seen,\\nin particular in travellers to South Asia where rates can reach up to\\n50%. Other drugs used are e.g. quinacrine, nitazoxanide and\\nfurazolidone.\\nFurther Reading\\n1. Kelly P. Intestinal protozoa. In: Farrar J, editor. Manson's Tropical\\nDiseases. 23rd ed.

       " \"A 4-Year-Old Boy from Laos With a Lesion of the Lip and Cheek\\nM. LEILA SROUR\\nCase Presentation\\nHistory\\nYou are sent a picture of a 4-year-old boy taken by a visitor at a remote district hospital in Laos (Fig. 5.1). You receive a limited history and physical examination: Three days ago, the family noticed a dark sore on the child's cheek. The child's breath smells bad, he is not eating and he appears list-less. The lesion progressed quickly from a sore to eat through the child's cheek. The child, who is unimmunized, had a fever and rash about 2 months ago and recovered. The family is very poor. The local doctors do not recognize this disease.\\n• Fig. 5.1 A 4-year-old Lao boy with a necrotizing lesion on the right cheek.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe 4-year-old child appears small and quiet. He is stunted and thin. His mouth has a gangrenous lesion that has destroyed part of his upper and lower lips and cheek, expos-ing his teeth.\\nQuestions\\n1. What is your differential diagnosis?\\n2. What should you recommend to help this child?\\nDiscussion\\nThis chronically malnourished child, living in a remote vil-lage of a poor developing country, has a rapidly advancing gangrenous lesion of the face.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Is Your Differential Diagnosis?\\nA few days earlier, when the child had a sore on the face and bad breath, you may have suspected a tooth abscess and cel-lulitis. The rapid destruction of tissue is typical of noma, an opportunistic infection that affects poor children whose immune systems are compromised by malnutrition and often other infections, commonly measles or malaria. Other ulcerating facial lesions such as oral cancer, syphilis and yaws are unlikely in a young child. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is unlikely to develop at such a rapid pace and be so destructive. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis may lead to severe tissue destruction but it is non-endemic in Laos. There are no diag-nostic laboratory tests because the diagnosis is made clinically.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat Should You Recommend to Help This Child?\\nYou recommend treating the child with penicillin and met-ronidazole to cover the suspected aerobic and anaerobic oro-pharyngeal bacteria. You emphasize the need for nutritional support, which can be challenging with a mouth lesion. Local foods, including eggs, milk, soy products and peanuts, can be liquefied and fed orally or enterally. Other diseases such as malaria, intestinal parasites, tuberculosis and vitamin deficiencies should be looked for and treated. Necrotic tissue can be removed. Physiotherapy will be needed to prevent contractures with healing. Reconstructive surgery should not be attempted for at least 1 year and be done only by an experienced surgical team. Improved nutrition before sur-gery may improve the outcome.\\nSurvivors of noma suffer from disfigurement and func-tional problems with speech and eating. They may present as young adults seeking help. Their history reveals the illness as a child of younger than 10 years of age.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe child was treated successfully with antibiotics and nutri-tional support. His face healed with contractures, resulting in disfigurement and salivary incontinence. At age 9 years, he was referred for surgery by a visiting international surgical team. After two surgeries, his appearance was improved, and the salivary incontinence corrected (Fig. 5.2).\\n• Fig. 5.2 At age 9 after two surgeries correcting facial contractures and salivary incontinence.\\nFurther Reading\\n1.

       " \"51 A 34-Year-Old HIV-Positive Woman from Malawi With Slowly Progressive Half-Sided Weakness JURI KATCHANOV Clinical Presentation History A 34-year-old Malawian woman presents to a neurology out- patient clinic in Malawi with slowly progressive weakness of the left arm and leg. Her problems started approximately 3 months earlier when she first noticed a limp in her left leg. The weakness progressed, and over the following weeks she also realized that her left arm was becoming affected. The patient is a poor historian and often has difficulty describing the onset and timing of sequential events, but from her story it appears likely that the problems started insidiously and have been slowly progressing since. She denies any head trauma, headache, recent episodes of fever, nausea, visual impairment or loss of weight. The review of systems is unremarkable. The patient was diagnosed with smear-positive pulmo- nary tuberculosis 5 months earlier. At that time, she was also found to be HIV-reactive with a baseline CD4 count of 54/µL. She was started on antituberculous therapy, vitamin B6, antiretroviral therapy and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, all of which she is currently taking. The patient works as a street vendor selling mobile phone vouchers. Despite her left-sided weakness she is still able to work sitting on a plastic chair and managing her vouchers and money with her right hand. She is divorced and does not have any children. She lives in an urban high-density area. Clinical Findings She is afebrile and her vital signs and general examination are normal apart from slightly pale conjunctivae. On fundo- scopy her fundi are normal without any signs of papilloe- dema or retinitis. The neurological examination reveals a spastic hemipar- esis on the left with hyperreflexia. The power in the left leg is 2/5 (active movement with gravity eliminated) and in her left arm 3/5 (active movement against gravity). There is a pronator drift on the left (Fig. 51.1) indicating proximal weakness. Sensation of pain is reduced in her left leg and hand. The examination of her cranial nerves is normal. Laboratory Results Full blood count: WBC 3.8 × 10º/L (reference range: 4–10), haemoglobin 9.9g/dL (12-14), platelets 140×109/L (150-350). Questions 1. What is your differential diagnosis? 2. What is your diagnostic approach in a resource-limited setting? Discussion A 34-year-old HIV-positive woman from Malawi presents with a 3-month history of progressive left-sided weakness of insidious onset. She was diagnosed with pulmonary • Fig. 51.1 Pronator drift on the left side as a sign of left upper limb weak- ness. The patient was asked to stretch out both arms and close her eyes. 141 tuberculosis (TB) and HIV 5 months before her presenta- tion. She is on antiretroviral therapy (ART), co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and on antituberculous medication. On exami- nation, there is a spastic hemiparesis on the left side with sen- sory involvement. Answer to Question 1 What is Your Differential Diagnosis? The combination of spastic hemiparesis with hyperreflexia and sensory impairment affecting one half of the body local- izes the lesion to her brain. The onset appears subactute and the progression is slow. This makes ischaemic and haemor- rhagic lesions ('strokes') unlikely causes because they present (hyper-)acutely and usually do not progress. Most likely the patient has one or several focal brain lesion(s). The differential diagnosis of focal brain lesions (FBLs) in HIV-infected individuals in tropical countries is broad. Patients may suffer from HIV-related brain diseases such as cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoence- phalopathy, CNS lymphoma, cryptococcoma and CMV encephalitis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of the brain parenchyma can present as tuberculoma or tuberculous abscess. Furthermore, HIV-positive individuals may suffer from conditions primarily unrelated to their HIV infection such as a brain tumour, brain metastases or a cerebral abscess. Endemic 'tropical' diseases such as neurocysticercosis, neuroschistosomiasis or, in Latin America, Chagas' disease, can also present with focal brain lesions and should be considered according to the local epidemiological pattern. In this particular case, the patient developed a focal brain lesion 2 months after starting ART. Central nervous system disorders are common after ART initiation. It is thought that the recovering immune system may 'unmask' or 'paradoxi- cally deteriorate' pre-existing CNS infections. This phenom- enon is called immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and, depending on the type, is termed 'unmasking' or 'paradoxical' IRIS. Tuberculoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopa- thy (PML) and cryptococcoma have been well documented in the context of IRIS. Toxoplasmosis has been described after ART initiation, even in patients on co-trimoxazole prophylaxis. Of note, our patient was diagnosed with TB at the time of ART initiation and CNS tuberculosis can deteriorate after ART introduction as well as after commencement of TB treatment. Answer to Question 2 What is Your Diagnostic Approach in a Resource- Limited Setting? The diagnostic work-up of FBLs in a resource-limited setting primarily depends on the availability of investiga- tions. It often remains mainly clinical, guided by epidemio- logical evidence and by the degree of immunosuppression in HIV-positive patients. Clinicians may often find them- selves restricted to the pragmatic approach of 'treating the treatable'. If the patient is HIV-positive, a CD4 count should be per- formed. Some FBLs are very unlikely if the CD4 count is above 200/μL, e.g. cryptococcoma or cerebral toxoplasmosis. Cerebral TB can occur at any CD4 count. PML mostly man- ifests in patients with advanced immunosuppression but has also been described in patients with higher CD4 counts. Serum antitoxoplasma IgG and cryptococcal antigen (CrAG) are helpful, but may not be routinely available. Negative antitoxoplasma serology makes toxoplasmosis a very unlikely diagnosis, whereas a positive serological result documents past contact with the pathogen but fails to prove its relevance for the current illness. Sensitivity of CSF examination in FBL is low, and both cryptococcoma and tuberculoma may present with a normal CSF. However, if XPert MTB/RIF or Ziehl-Neelsen stain, CrAG, India Ink or fungal cultures are available, these tests should be done and might help establish the diagnosis. Chest radiography and abdominal ultrasound are useful because they may reveal tuberculous lesions, metastases or a primary neoplasm. Cerebral imaging plays an important role in diagnosing FBLs; however, availability is extremely limited in resource-constrained settings. CT may at times produce non-specific results confirming the clinical diagnosis of an FBL but failing to assist the clinician in narrowing down the spectrum of differential diagnoses. MRI is more informa- tive; however, it is practically unavailable as a routine inves- tigation in tropical low- and middle-income settings. Cystic lesions on CT are indicative of neurocysticercosis. Cerebral oedema with mass effect and contrast enhancement would favour cerebral abscess, tuberculoma, toxoplasmosis and CNS lymphoma, whereas PML classically shows no mass effect and no enhancement. Meningeal enhancement is typical for tuberculosis. The Case Continued... Routine CSF examination was normal, India Ink stain and fungal cultures were negative. The patient was started on empirical antitoxoplasmosis treatment with high-dose co-tri- moxazole. ART and antituberculous treatment were contin- ued. Prednisolone 1 mg/kg bodyweight was added to cover for presumed IRIS. The patient was put on a waiting list for a cerebral MRI scan, which was available thanks to a local research project. On 4-week follow-up her clinical status was unchanged. At 8 weeks there was further deterioration of power in her left hand. An MRI of her head was done which showed multi- focal T2 hyperintense lesions exclusively affecting the white matter and more prominent in the right hemisphere (frontal and temporal lobes). Furthermore, there was a small area of demyelination in the left cerebellar peduncle. These radiological findings were deemed strongly suggestive of PML.

       " \"A 56-Year-Old Man from Peru With Prolonged Fever and Severe Anaemia CIRO MAGUIÑA, CARLOS SEAS AND FREDERIQUE JACQUERIOZ Clinical Presentation History A 56-year-old male Peruvian is admitted to a hospital in the capital, Lima, with a 2-week history of fever, jaundice and confusion. Daily fever started 3 months after leaving a rural area in the highlands of northern Peru (altitude of 2400 m), where the patient spent 3 weeks on vacation. In the second week of illness the patient noticed dark urine and jaundice, and few days before admission his wife noticed confusion and som-nolence. While in the rural area, the patient and his wife were bitten at night by tiny mosquitoes; no personal protection was used. Otherwise there has been no animal contact. The past medical history is unremarkable. Clinical Findings His blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse 110 bpm and reg-ular, temperature_39.2°C (102.6°F), respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. The patient appears confused and disor-ientated without any focal neurological findings or menin-geal signs (GCS 14/15). Skin and conjunctivae are markedly pale and there is scleral jaundice. Cardiovascular and pulmonary examination are normal. The liver is slightly enlarged but there is no splenomegaly. Laboratory Results Creatinine, electrolytes and alkaline phosphatase are normal. His additional routine laboratory results are shown in Table 52.1. Coomb's test is negative. The CSF results are normal. Further Investigations A CT scan of the brain is normal. Abdominal ultrasound reveals hepatomegaly, but no focal lesions. Questions 1. What are your differential diagnoses? 2. How would you approach this patient? Discussion A Peruvian man presents with a history of prolonged fever, altered neurological status and evidence of haemolysis after a stay in a rural area in the highlands of Peru. Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Differential Diagnoses? The most important differential diagnoses in this patient are malaria and bartonellosis. Plasmodium vivax is the only species of Plasmodium prev-alent in the highland regions of Peru. Interestingly, the patient presents with several features of severe and compli-cated malaria, including severe anaemia, jaundice and impaired consciousness. However, P. vivax is not commonly associated with severe malaria. Bartonellosis is another important diagnosis to consider given the recent travel history in the highlands of Peru, where sandflies, the vectors of bartonellosis, are present. The patient also reported being bitten by tiny mosquitoes. Less common infections to include in the differential diagnosis are rickett-sial diseases (both endemic and epidemic typhus are present in Peru), leptospirosis, typhoid fever, brucellosis and several viral diseases, including viral hepatitis and yellow fever. However, none of them produces significant haemolysis and some are not endemic in the highlands (yellow fever for instance). Non-infectious causes of haemolysis should also be considered.

The first step is to rule out malaria by performing a thick and thin smear or by using rapid diagnostic tests. Based on the exposure history and the high suspicion of bartonellosis, a thin film should be performed to calculate the differential leukocyte count and to look for the presence of Bartonella bacilliformis in red blood cells.\",\n",

Other causes of bacterial sepsis, including inva-\\nsive meningococcal disease have to be considered.\\nA severe viral infection with an adenovirus or influenza\\nwould be possible but the patient appears slightly too unwell\\nfor this. Measles commonly presents with pronounced con-\\njunctivitis, but at this stage one would see a rash. Zika virus\\nwas discovered in Uganda and presents with conjunctivitis,\\nbut usually is a mild viral illness and does not cause shock.\\nThe fact that the patient's husband has recently died of a\\nsimilar severe febrile illness should raise the suspicion of\\na viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). Marburg virus disease\\n(MVD) has been associated with mines.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow Would You Approach the Patient and What\\nTests Would You Do?\\nThe patient should be treated with extreme caution because\\nof the possibility of a viral haemorrhagic fever. Nosocomial\\nspread of these diseases can cause hospital outbreaks with a\\nhigh case fatality rate. The patient should ideally be isolated\\nin a side room. Blood tests should be kept to a minimum to\\nreduce the risk to laboratory staff. Protective clothing, such as\\ngloves and a surgical gown, are recommended during proce-\\ndures. The risk of transmission of VHF viruses from a\\nmalaria slide is very low once the blood spot is dry; therefore\\nit would be reasonable to do a malaria slide or a rapid diag-\\nnostic test. However, the prevalence of Plasmodium falci-\\nparum parasitaemia in Uganda is high and a positive slide\\nwould not rule out VHF.\\nTo protect laboratory staff all biochemical and haemato-\\nlogical tests should be done using near-patient testing if\\npossible.\\nThe public health authorities should be alerted to the pos-\\nsibility of a case of viral haemorrhagic fever. Ideally testing for\\nthis should be organized, but samples are likely to need spe-\\ncial shipping arrangements to be taken to a specialized\\nlaboratory.\",\n",

After 3 months of TB\\ntreatment for a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary tubercu-\\nlosis, he shows no clinical improvement. The patient is cachec-\\ntic with cervical lymphadenopathy and abnormal pulmonary\\nauscultation. Laboratory investigations show thrombocytosis.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Are Your Differential Diagnoses?\\nThe most important differential diagnoses in the given set-\\nting are MDR TB, histoplasmosis and paracoccidioidomyco-\\nsis. TB is highly endemic in Peru and MDR TB is an\\nincreasing issue. TB and MDR TB almost always need to\\nbe considered when clinical symptoms and evolution, as in\\nthis case, are suggestive of the disease. What would be\\nunusual about this patient is his origin from a rural area in\\nthe central Peruvian Amazon where MDR TB is still uncom-\\nmon in comparison with underprivileged districts of Lima\\nand other big cities of Peru.\\nHistoplasmosis can present with recurrent or progressive\\npulmonary symptoms that can mimic TB. However, his\\npresentation would suggest a chronic form that is more often\\nseen in individuals with preexisting chronic obstructive\\npulmonary disease, which this patient does not have. The\\npatient's age, gender, occupation, origin and clinical symp-\\ntoms with a pulmonary focus are all typical of the chronic\\nform of paracoccidioidomycosis and make this diagnosis\\nthe most likely of the three. Co-infection of TB (non-MDR)\\nand paracoccidioidomycosis are not uncommon and should\\nalso be kept in mind as a possible differential. Parasitic infec-\\ntions such as paragonimiasis or pulmonary hydatid cyst are\\nalso possible diagnoses, though less common. Imaging (chest\\nradiography and CT scan) will help identifying the typical\\nlesions of these infections.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow Would You Approach this Patient?\\nThe first step in this patient is to evaluate him for MDR TB.\\nInitial investigations should include chest radiography (the\\npatient should also be asked to bring the initial chest x-ray\\nand report for comparison), tuberculin skin test (PPD)\\nand repeated AFB sputum smears and sputum-PCR (Xpert\\nMTB/RIF) for M. tuberculosis. Mycobacterial culture should\\ncomplete the evaluation and, if positive, culture-based drug\\nsensitivity testing should be added. Locally endemic fungal\\ninfections (e.g. histoplasmosis and paracoccidioidomycosis)\\nshould be evaluated by direct examination of sputum with\\nwet mount potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation and\\ncultures. Depending on chest radiographic findings, local\\navailability and costs, a CT scan of the chest could be con-\\nsidered as well as bronchoscopy with biopsy if less invasive\\ndiagnostic evaluation is unrevealing. The thrombocytosis\\nshould be confirmed on a smear.\\n\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe tuberculin skin test was negative as were two AFB smears.\\nThe chest x-ray showed bilateral confluent reticulonodular\\ninfiltrates and multiple cavities in the right lung (Fig. 55.1).\\nExamination of his sputum (KOH preparation) revealed the\\ncharacteristic yeast forms of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis\\n(Fig. 55.2). Culture grew P. brasiliensis.\\nThe thrombocytosis was considered reactive to the\\nunderlying chronic infection. Given the extensive pulmonary\\nlesions and HTLV-1 co-infection, the patient was started on\\namphotericin B followed by itraconazole (as opposed to itra-\\nconazole alone). TB treatment was discontinued.\\nOur patient was HTLV-1 positive. His symptoms were\\nconfined to the lungs as in the chronic adult form of paracoc-\\ncidioidomycosis (see Summary Box), but his pulmonary\\nlesions were unusually extensive. His long-term prognosis\\ndepends on the extent of pulmonary fibrotic sequelae.\\n\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nParacoccidioidomycosis\\nParacoccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection endemic\\nonly to the moist tropical regions of Latin America. The infection is\\ncaused by the thermally dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides\\nbrasiliensis, which grows as mould in the environment and as\\nyeast in tissue and at 37°C. Humans are infected through the\\ninhalation of aerosolized conidia (spores) from the soil. In endemic\\nareas, initial exposure occurs in childhood and the majority of\\nprimary infections remain asymptomatic or subclinical. In those\\nwho develop disease, two main clinical forms are observed\\n(Table 55.1). The chronic adult form is characterized by pulmo-\\nnary symptoms that slowly develop over months, typically in\\nmiddle-aged men living in rural endemic areas, which are often\\naccompanied by mucosal lesions. Women of fertile age are rarely\\naffected, probably because of a protective effect of oestradiol\\npreventing the transformation of the fungus into the yeast stage.\\nThe acute juvenile form is seen in children and young adults of\\nboth sexes and presents as an acute systemic disease of the\\nreticuloendothelial system. Adult patients with advanced HIV\\ninfection present a more aggressive acute disease similar to the\\njuvenile acute form with extensive pulmonary involvement.\\nDiagnosis is confirmed by visualization of P. brasiliensis (yeast\\nform) on wet preparation of specimen and/or isolation in fungal\\nculture. The identification of P. brasiliensis is more difficult in\\nsputum than in skin lesions or material from lymph nodes. The\\nyeast is easily observed on KOH preparation but its isolation in\\nculture is difficult and takes 20 to 30 days. Serological testing is\\nuseful for antibody detection and diagnosis, assessing disease\\nseverity and monitoring treatment response.

       " \"56\\nA 21-Year-Old Pregnant Woman\\nfrom The Gambia With a Rash\\nDAVID C.W. MABEY\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 21-year-old woman comes to your clinic in The Gambia\\ncomplaining of a generalized, non-itchy rash that she has had\\nfor 5 days. She is otherwise well and has no significant past\\nmedical history. She is 32 weeks pregnant. This is her first\\npregnancy.\\nClinical Findings\\nShe has a generalized rash (Fig. 56.1). Her mouth is normal,\\nand there is no lymphadenopathy. She is not anaemic or\\njaundiced, and general examination is unremarkable.\\nQuestions\\n1. What is the most likely diagnosis, and how might this\\naffect the outcome of her pregnancy?\\n2. How would you manage the patient?\\nDiscussion\\nA 21-year-old pregnant Gambian woman presents because of\\na generalized macular rash involving the palms of both\\nhands. The rash is non-itchy and she is otherwise fine.\\nSyphilis in preg-\\nnancy has a serious influence on pregnancy outcome. A study\\nin Tanzania showed that, among women with latent syphilis\\nand a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titre of ≥1:8, 25% delivered\\na stillborn baby, and 33% a low-birth-weight baby.\\nThe baby may be born with signs of congenital syphilis,\\nincluding a generalized bullous rash, jaundice and hepatos-\\nplenomegaly. In this case the prognosis is bad, with a 50% case fatality rate even with treatment. Alternatively, the\\nbaby may appear normal at birth, and present at the age\\nof 3 to 4 months with failure to thrive and signs of congen-\\nital syphilis, usually including a generalized rash which\\naffects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet\\n(Fig. 56.2). Other common signs include hepatosplenome-\\ngaly, painful periostitis involving the long bones, and a per-\\nsistent nasal discharge, which may be bloodstained (the\\n'syphilitic snuffles').\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow Would You Manage the Patient?\\nIntramuscular benzathine penicillin is the treatment of\\nchoice for syphilis. A single dose of 2.4 million units i.m.\\nis recommended for primary, secondary and early latent\\nsyphilis (of less than two years' duration). A single dose, given\\nbefore 28 weeks' gestation, has been shown to prevent\\nadverse outcomes resulting from syphilis. Because this\\npatient has not been treated before 28 weeks, her infant\\nshould receive a course of treatment for congenital syphilis\\n(IM procaine penicillin 50000 units/kg daily for\\n10–14 days)\\n• Fig. 56.1 Generalized, non-itchy macular rash in a pregnant\\nGambian woman.\\n155\\n156 CHAPTER 56 A 21-Year-Old Pregnant Woman from The Gambia With a Rash\\n• Fig. 56.2 Congenital syphilis in a 3-month-old infant: desquamating\\nlesion of the palms.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe patient was treated with a single IM dose of benzathine\\npenicillin and she made an uneventful recovery. She deliv-\\nered a normal infant at term.\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nSyphilis in Pregnancy\\nPrimary syphilis causes an ulcer or chancre, at the site of inoc-\\nulation, which is usually painless. Women are often unaware of the\\nlesion, because it may be on the cervix or vaginal wall. The sec-\\nondary stage usually occurs 6 to 8 weeks later, causing a gen-\\neralized rash that often affects the palms of the hands, and usually\\ndoes not itch. There may be other manifestations, including\\njaundice or ocular involvement (uveitis). The clinical signs resolve\\nover a few weeks in the absence of treatment, after which the\\npatient enters the latent stage. A small minority develop tertiary\\nlesions involving the cardiovascular or nervous system many\\nyears later. Progression may be more rapid in HIV-positive\\npatients. Women with secondary syphilis, who have a disseminated infection, are most likely to infect their foetus, but\\nthe infection can cross the placenta in pregnant women with\\nlatent syphilis.\\nAccording to current WHO estimates, syphilis in pregnancy\\ncauses 355,000 adverse pregnancy outcomes per year, includ-\\ning 143,000 early foetal deaths and stillbirths and 61,000 neonatal\\ndeaths. These could be prevented if all pregnant women were\\nscreened for syphilis, and treated with a single dose of penicillin if\\nthey test positive, before 28 weeks' gestation.\\nSerological tests for syphilis are either treponemal (e.g. TPHA,\\nTPPA), or non-treponemal (e.g. RPR or VDRL). Treponemal tests\\nremain positive for life, whereas non-treponemal tests usually\\nrevert to negative after successful treatment, and can therefore be\\nused as a test of cure. They may give false-positive results\\nbecause of other infections (e.g. malaria), or autoimmune dis-\\neases. Until recently it has not been possible to screen women\\nattending antenatal clinics that do not have access to a labora-\\ntory. However, sensitive and specific treponemal point-of-care\\ntests are now available at an affordable price (<$1) which can give\\na result in 15 minutes and require neither electricity nor laboratory\\nequipment.\\nFurther Reading\\n1.

The symptoms started with stomach rumbles and colicky abdominal pain; later on, she suffered anorexia and vomiting. The diarrhoea is voluminous, not related to meals, and occurs both during the day and at night (five to ten times in 24 hours). She received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, as well as antidiarrhoeal drugs, without any improvement. During the last month she has developed lower limb swelling and severe prostration. Clinical Findings The patient appears generally unwell; she is pale and has angular stomatitis. She is afebrile, heart rate 100 bpm, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, scaphoid abdomen with borborygmi, pitting oedema of the lower limbs, and decreased skin turgor.

       " \"A 36-year-old male restaurant owner presents to a travel clinic in Europe with a mobile itchy mass under his skin. Three weeks ago, he noted the mass in his groin for 4 days after which it subsided. He then noted an itchy, serpiginous rash tracking from his groin to his chest, which moved over the course of several days and then disappeared; he then noted the mass reappearing on his right shoulder, at which point he was referred for assessment. There is no history of fever or systemic illness. Five weeks ago, he returned from a fishing holiday with four friends to the Okavango Delta in Botswana. He took malaria chemoprophylaxis, slept on the boat under a mosquito net and swam in fresh river water. He ate freshwater fish from the river. He is married and denies sexual contact on the trip. Of the four friends who accompanied him, two also have the same complaint. The patient is afebrile and organ system examination is normal. On his right upper deltoid is a firm mass with clear margins 3 x 8 cm in size. On further questioning this mass has recently migrated across his upper chest wall, and a serpiginous tract is visible (Fig. 6.1). There is no additional rash and no lymphadenopathy. Total white cell count 8.9 × 10⁹/L (reference range: 4–10), eosinophil count 0.9 × 10⁹/L (<0.5), liver function tests, creatinine and electrolytes are normal. HIV antibodies are negative. The presentation is classic for gnathostomiasis, even though his travel history appears uncommon. Gnathostomiasis is endemic in South-East Asia and Latin America, but only a few cases have been reported in Africa. It is a food-borne zoonotic nematode infection that classically presents with a mobile subcutaneous mass, intermittent creeping eruptions and eosinophilia. The infection is acquired by eating raw fish and other food items. Intermittent migratory swellings are also typically seen in patients with Loa loa infection (calabar swelling), but Loa loa is not endemic in the Okavango Delta and the minimum incubation time is 5 months. A very rare cause of migratory swellings and eosinophilia is sparganosis. It is caused by larvae (‘spargana') of canine and feline tapeworms of the genus Spirometra and acquired by drinking water containing infected copepods or by eating raw or undercooked intermediate hosts such as amphibians or reptiles. It mainly occurs in East and South-East Asia, but cases have also been reported in East Africa. Several other infections acquired in the tropics can be migratory and are associated with an itchy track-like rash. Such creeping eruptions are commonly caused by larvae of animal hookworms or Strongyloides stercoralis but these present with fine, serpiginous tracks and not with a large mobile mass, as seen in this patient. Very rare causes of creeping eruption are ectopic fascioliasis and migratory myiasis. Deaths from gnathostomiasis have occurred when the parasite has entered the brain or spinal cord, causing severe neurological sequelae.\",\n",

Despite various antibiotic therapies, clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers had deteriorated, resulting in hospital admission. Pus and blood cultures did not yield any growth, and histopathology of a lymph node biopsy showed non-specific lymphadenitis. The symptoms started 6 to 8 weeks after her return from a family visit to northern Thailand. During her stay the patient had suffered from high fever, dry cough and fatigue. A 46-year-old woman, 158cm, 65kg (BMI 26kg/m²), afebrile, blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, pulse 80bpm. Enlarged, tender cervical, nuchal, inguinal and axillary lymph nodes. Massive, tender swelling of the upper eyelids. Disseminated fluctuant cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses with surrounding erythema (Fig. 61.1), discharge of pus on slight pressure. Painful swelling of the left elbow. Otherwise normal physical examination. Lab results on admission show WCC 30.8 (× 10⁹/L), Haemoglobin 8.2 (g/dL), MCV 88 (fL), Platelets 592 (x 10⁹/L), CRP 267 (mg/L), and ESR >110 (mm/h). A radiograph of the patient's left elbow shows osteolytic lesions of the radial epicondylus, osteomyelitis and articular effusion. The differential diagnoses considered were systemic infections such as fungal (histoplasmosis), mycobacterial, or specific bacterial infections (Burkholderia pseudomallei, Brucella species, Francisella tularensis or Actinomyces species), as well as underlying immunodeficiency or autoimmune syndromes. Initial investigations included biopsies of skin, abscesses and lymph nodes for culture and histopathological studies. Initially, the clinically suspected diagnosis was melioidosis, and the patient received imipenem with slight improvement but persistently elevated inflammation parameters. Various cultures from skin and lymph node biopsies remained sterile.\",\n",

The ulcer has been present for the past 4 months and is not healing (Fig. 62.1). There is no history of prior trauma; however, he had a previous ulcer on his right ankle some years ago which took about a year to heal. He also complains of pain in his right thigh and in both knees.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe patient is short for an adult; he is pale and has a tinge of jaundice. The ulcer is on his left ankle, next to the medial malleolus; the skin surrounding it is hyperpigmented. There is tenderness in both knee joints and in his right thigh. The rest of the physical examination is normal. Vital signs: Tem- perature 36.6°C, pulse 88 bpm, blood pressure 110/ 70 mmHg.\\nQuestions\\n1. What is your differential diagnosis?\\n2. How would you confirm the diagnosis?\\n• Fig. 62.1 The patient's left leg showing an ulcer surrounded by hyper- pigmented skin on the medial malleolus.\\nDiscussion\\nA 28-year-old West African man presents with a chronic, painful ankle ulcer. He had a similar ulcer on the other foot a few years prior. He also complains of bone pains. He is short for an adult, pale and mildly jaundiced.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat is Your Differential Diagnosis?\\nThe chronic nature of the ulcer, its site and the surrounding hyperpigmentation make a venous ulcer likely. The patient's bone pain, jaundice and pallor could point to a haemolytic anaemia. Various hereditary haemolytic anaemias may be complicated by chronic leg ulceration, e.g. haemoglobinopa- thies (thalassaemia and sickle cell disease), spherocytosis and pyruvate kinase deficiency. In the West African context, sickle cell disease is the most likely diagnosis.\\nFurther differentials would be tropical ulcer, diabetic ulcer or chronic osteomyelitis with a discharging sinus. Bur- uli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is usually pain- less. Other mycobacterial infections can also present with chronic skin ulcers. Pyoderma gangrenosum and malignant diseases also need to be considered.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow Would You Confirm the Diagnosis?\\nA full blood count and a peripheral blood film should be done. In sickle cell disease, during an acute crisis, abundant sickled red cells can be seen on a blood film. Other charac- teristic but non-specific features include target cells, Howell– Jolly bodies, polychromasia and nucleated red cells. The presence of HbS can be demonstrated by using a simple sickle slide or solubility test. Blood is mixed with sodium metabisulphite, which will provoke sickling of cells contain- ing HbS; this can be demonstrated on a slide. If resources allow, confirmation is by haemoglobin electrophoresis, liquid chromatography or isoelectric focusing.\\nFasting blood sugar and wound swab for culture and sen- sitivity as well as a radiograph of the left leg should be done to rule out other differential diagnoses and osteomyelitis.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nBlood was taken and the available results are shown in Table 62.1. The patient's blood film is shown in Figure 62.2. The sickling test was positive and haemoglobin electrophoresis showed a homozygous HbSS-type. The wound swab grew Pseu- domonas species sensitive to levofloxacin. Radiography showed a periosteal reaction with slightly sclerotic bones.\\nTABLE 62.1 Laboratory Results\\nParameter Patient initial visit Patient 6 years later Reference Range\\nWBC (×109/L) 17.6 9.2 4-10\\nHaemoglobin (g/dL) 6.9 8.3 13-15\\nPlatelet (×109/L) Adequate 364 150-400\\nFasting blood glucose (mmol/L) 4.8 Not done 4.4-6.1\\n• Fig. 62.2 Patient's blood film: irreversibly sickled cells (S), polychroma- sia (P), target cells (TC), nucleated red cells (NRC) – note similarity with lymphocyte (L). Adequate platelets.\\nThe patient was managed with alternate daily wound dressing using normal saline irrigation and povi- done-iodine. High white cell counts are commonly seen in sickle cell disease. They may be the result of bone marrow stimulation and do not necessarily indicate systemic infec- tion. However, in view of the patient's generally poor condi- tion and the Pseudomonas grown from his wound swab, it was decided to give him systemic antibiotic treatment.\\nStrict bed rest was difficult to enforce because the young man was self-employed and could not afford to take the required time off work. His recurrent bone pain was man- aged conservatively with good hydration, prompt treatment of infections and relief of other identifiable precipitants of crises. He received daily folic acid supplementation. Pain relief was achieved with paracetamol and tramadol.\\nHowever, on follow-up 3 years later, the ulcer was still not healed. Grafting was under consideration, when healthy granulation tissue would be achieved.\\nSix years later, the wound had still not healed and the patient could not afford a skin graft. He had 3 times weekly dressing and felt well in himself. His WBC was normal and his Hb had slightly increased (see Table 62.1).\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nLeg Ulcers in Sickle Cell Disease\\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a collection of autosomal- codominant genetic disorders characterized by the production of abnormal sickle haemoglobin S (HbS). Homozygous HbSS leads to sickle cell anaemia, the most severe form of SCD. Sickle cell disease is the commonest hereditary haematological disorder.\\nHbS has the tendency to polymerize during hypoxia. This leads to a reduction of the flexibility of the erythrocyte and to the typical sickle shape of the affected cell. Sickled red blood cells lead to haemolysis and vaso-occlusion.\\nThe disease is characterized by episodes of acute illness against a background of progressive organ damage. Any organ can be affected by SCD at any age; however, certain features tend to predominate in certain age-groups. Leg ulcers tend to manifest in adulthood. Pathophysiology is complex and remains incompletely understood. Ulcers in SCD occur in areas with thin skin and little subcutaneous fat, most commonly on the ankles. They are notoriously difficult to treat. The ulcers are slow to heal and are characterized by unexplained relapses. They are com- monly very painful and patients may occasionally require opioids for pain control. Colonization with pathogenic bacteria is com- mon. Periosteal reaction is usually seen in the underlying bones but osteomyelitis is uncommon.\\nOf the many treatments, the most certain to aid healing is complete bed rest with leg elevation. Oral zinc sulphate tablets (200 mg tid) have been shown to be helpful. Systemic antibiotic therapy is given in acute sepsis. The use of hydroxyurea in leg ulcers is controversial. Chronic transfusion regimens to maintain the haemoglobin level above 10g/dL may help when conser- vative therapy fails. Skin grafting for clean wounds is recom- mended, especially when the defect is large. The relapse rate is high, however. Poor nutrition which has not been given much attention may be a crucial factor and needs to be investigated on a wide scale in sickle cell disease.\",\n",
       " \"63 A 38-Year-Old European Expatriate Living in Malawi With Difficulty Passing Urine JOEP J. VAN OOSTERHOUT Clinical Presentation History A 38-year-old European expatriate presents at the medical outpatient clinic in a tertiary hospital in Malawi with pro- gressive constipation and difficulty passing urine for the past 3 weeks. He noticed that he had to use increasing abdominal pressure to pass urine and eventually became only able to pass small amounts at a time. This is associated with increas- ing lower abdominal discomfort, abnormal sensations in the groins and around the genitals and some erectile dysfunction. He has no weakness and there is no dysaesthesia and no loss of sensation in his legs. However, he mentions that walking did not feel normal, although he cannot fully explain what the abnormality is. He has no backache. Over the past 2 months he has experienced unintentional weight loss of 8 kg and fatigue without fever or night sweats. He blames this on stressful circumstances at work. He has sexual contact with his wife only, to whom he has been mar- ried for several years. One week prior to presentation he had noticed reddish discoloration of his urine. He had no painful micturition or fever at that time. He visited a local clinic and was pre- scribed four different types of medication, which he com- pleted. There is no history of trauma and the rest of his previous medical history is unremarkable. Physical Examination He looks healthy and has normal vital signs. There are no abnormalities on general examination, except for a palpable bladder. The rectal examination reveals a low anal sphincter tone and the genital examination is normal. He has lively, symmetrical tendon reflexes in the legs without clonus or pathological plantar reflexes, and no abnormalities in the rest of the neurological examination. Questions 1. Which important pieces of information are missing? 2. What are possible diagnoses and which investigations would you order? Discussion A 38-year-old European expatriate living in Malawi presents with constipation, bladder retention, an episode of probable haematuria, erectile dysfunction, genital paraesthesia, signif- icant weight loss and fatigue. There are no abnormal neuro- logical findings on examination, however most of the complaints are compatible with a conus syndrome because of a lesion within the conus medullaris or because of com- pression. The constitutional symptoms suggest an underly- ing chronic infection or malignancy. Answer to Question 1 Which Important Pieces of Information Are Missing? The important missing pieces of information are details of the recent visit to the local clinic and exposure to fresh water in Malawi. On physical examination, the anal reflex should have been tested. Answer to Question 2 What Are Possible Diagnoses and Which Investigations Would You Order? The most important differential diagnosis for a conus medul- laris syndrome in a young, otherwise healthy man living in tropical Africa is spinal cord schistosomiasis. Other impor- tant infections to consider are spinal tuberculosis, a spinal abscess and neurosyphilis. A tumour or metastases impinging on the conus medullaris should be ruled out. Urine and stool microscopy for ova of Schistosoma haema- tobium and S. mansoni, respectively, should be ordered. A full blood count should be done, including a white cell differen- tial count to look for eosinophilia. Creatinine and C-reactive protein should be tested. Schistosomiasis serology would be useful in this expatriate. A VDRL and an HIV test should be done. An ultrasound of the abdomen assessing bladder volume before and after micturition and imaging of the spinal cord should be requested. The Case Continued... The patient was able to retrieve details of his urine micros- copy from the local clinic. Schistosoma haematobium eggs had been identified in his urine and he had been treated with a full dose of praziquantel, a course of ciprofloxacin, busco- pan and bisacodyl. He had swum regularly in Lake Malawi. An abdominal ultrasound scan after attempted micturi- tion showed a large bladder residue without further abnormalities. Full blood count showed a normal absolute WBC of 9 × 109/L with a relative eosinophilia of 21.8% (reference range: 1-6%) and an absolute eosinophil count of 1.15 × 109/L (reference: <0.45 × 10º/L). ALT was slightly elevated. Creatinine and CRP were normal. An HIV test and the VDRL were negative and micros- copy of a stool and urine sample were normal. Serological tests for schistosomiasis were not available. An MRI scan of the spinal cord was performed (Fig. 63.1). An enhancing 1 cm large lesion was seen at the anterior aspect of the conus, with associated high T2 sig- nal representing oedema extending from the lower end of the conus to the level of T9. In addition, there was nodular thickening of the urine bladder wall at the base and the pos- terior aspect. A dual infection with S. haematobium and S. mansoni is possible, because S. mansoni is the more common pathogen causing spinal cord schistosomiasis, and both pathogens are endemic in Malawi. Theoretically, the spinal cord abnormalities could have been caused by other conditions, such as tuberculosis and metastatic cancer, for instance from a bladder carcinoma. Although it has been argued that S. haematobium infection is a risk factor for bladder carcinoma, this is mainly observed in long-term heavy infections, which are uncommon in expa- triates. Further tests to rule out such distinct possibilities are not readily available in Malawi and were not deemed necessary. The patient required urinary catheterization for 2 weeks. He made a full recovery after a second course of praziquantel and a course of high-dose prednisolone, tapered off over 2 months. He was well after more than 2 years of follow-up. SUMMARY BOX Neuroschistosomiasis Neuroschistosomiasis can occur in the brain and more frequently in the spinal cord. Cerebral schistosomiasis can be asymptomatic or present with seizures, lateralizing signs and meningo-encephalitis. Spinal cord schistosomiasis (SCS) is more frequent in S. mansoni than in S. haemato- bium infections and often causes severe disability because of paraparesis and bladder dysfunction. It is also the most important severe complication of schistosomiasis in travellers. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of neu- roschistosomiasis is limited. For unknown reasons, ectopic worms lodge in the venous plexus around the CNS instead of their normal habitat. Laminectomy with biopsy of the nervous tissue is the only method that gives a definite diagnosis of SCS. However, this procedure should be avoided because of its risks. Diagnosis is based upon spinal cord imaging and proof of exposure to the parasite. Urine should be examined for S. haematobium eggs; for S. mansoni, stool microscopy may be attempted but lacks sensitivity, which is much higher for rectal biopsies. The circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) test is a urine antigen test, which may prove S. mansoni infection. It detects an antigen regurgitated by adult worms of S. mansoni. It is less sensitive for S. haematobium and generally works better if the parasite burden is high. A novel test for the circulating anodic antigen (CAA) is under devel- opment and seems to be more promising for proof of both parasite species in urine and blood. Serological tests are useful in patients from non-endemic countries. They lack sensitivity and specificity in endemic populations. Detection of schistosomal antibodies in the CSF is specific but not widely validated. Eosinophils are present in the CSF in about 50% of patients. Other causes of myelitis should be ruled out, which is often impossible in low-resource settings where pragmatic treatment for suspected neuroschistosomiasis may be justified. Treatment of neuroschistosomiasis is with antischistosomal drugs (praziquantel) plus corticosteroids and is based on case series and expert opinion. The pathology is caused by inflammation around Schistosoma eggs. Praziquantel kills adult flukes only and thereby stops additional eggs being shed into the spinal cord. Most early improvement of the neurological presentation is thought to result from the antiinflammatory effects of corticosteroids. The optimal dose and duration are not well known. Up to 6 months of high-dose corticosteroids is recommended; however, data from randomized controlled trials are lacking. Laminectomy should be considered in patients with severe spinal cord compression. About 65% of patients with spinal cord schistosomiasis who are treated early, recover completely or are left with neg- ligible deficits that do not cause any functional limitations; the remaining patients are left with sequelae that vary from mild to severe.

       " \"64 A 40-Year-Old Woman from Thailand and Her Brother-in-Law With Severe Headache CAMILLA ROTHE AND JURI KATCHANOV Clinical Presentation History A 40-year-old Thai woman presents to an outpatient clinic in Germany with a history of severe headache for the past 8 days. The headache was of gradual onset and did not respond to any painkillers. There is no fever and no chills. She denies any visual problems, any weakness of her limbs or memory problems. Ten days earlier she had returned from a 4-week journey to north-east Thailand, where she visited friends and relatives. During her visit she ate traditional regional dishes, including freshwater fish, seafood, snails and frogs. She reports that her brother-in-law, with whom she had shared several traditional meals, has also fallen ill with a severe headache. She presented to a municipal hospital 3 days earlier. A CT scan of her brain was performed and reported to be normal. Her blood count was also normal. A differential white cell count has not been done. Her past medical history is unremarkable. The patient is married, she is a housewife and has lived in Germany for the past 13 years. Clinical Findings On examination, she is afebrile, her neck is supple and Lasègue's sign (straight leg raise) is negative. Pupils are equal, round and react to light and accommodation, and there are no cranial nerve palsies. The remainder of the neurological examination, including the assessment of higher cortical functions such as language, memory and praxia, is unremarkable. There is no rash, no oral thrush and there are no subcutaneous swellings. Cardiopulmonary examination is normal. Liver and spleen are not enlarged, and there is no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory Results Her laboratory results at presentation in the clinic are shown in Table 64.1. Questions 1. What is your presumptive diagnosis? 2. Which investigation would you perform to substantiate your diagnosis? Discussion A 40-year-old Thai woman presents with a history of severe intractable headache after a stay in north-east Thailand where she enjoyed traditional regional dishes. Her brother-in-law in Thailand is suffering from the same severe headache. TABLE 64.1 Laboratory Results at Presentation in the Clinic Parameter (units) Patient Reference WBC (x 10°/L) 12.3 4-10 Eosinophils (x 10°/L) 2.34 <0.5 Haemoglobin (mg/dL) 11.7 12-14 MCV (fL) 70 83-103 Platelets (x 109/L) 330 150-350 ESR (mm/h) 20 <10 IgE (U/mL) 944 <100 Creatinine (µmol/L) 62 <80 ALT (U/L) 28 <30 GGT (U/L) 35 <40 C-reactive protein (mg/L) <5 <5 On examination, she is afebrile with no meningism and no focal neurological deficits. Her blood results reveal peripheral eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels. A CT scan of her brain done elsewhere showed no abnormalities. Answer to Question 1 What is Your Presumptive Diagnosis? The most likely diagnosis is a food-borne parasitic infection of the meninges. The key points from the history which support a food-borne infection are: (1) temporal relationship with travelling to north-east Thailand, where food-borne nematodes are prevalent; (2) consumption of traditional Thai food, including raw or undercooked freshwater fish, seafood, snails and frogs; and (3) the occurrence of similar symptoms in a relative who participated in the same meals (cluster). Headache is a typical symptom of meningitis, therefore infestation of the meninges is very likely. The diagnosis of a parasitosis is strongly supported by the presence of considerable blood eosinophilia and elevated IgE levels in serum. Answer to Question 2 Which Investigation Would You Perform to Substantiate Your Diagnosis? Parasitic infection of the meninges typically results in eosinophilic meningitis. The next investigation to perform is a lumbar puncture to confirm meningitis and to look for a possibly eosinophilic profile of inflammation. Eosinophilic meningitis in an otherwise healthy person with positive history of exposure to helminths and features of an outbreak is almost always attributable to a parasitic infestation. The main differential diagnoses are fungal meningitis with Coccidioides immitis (in North and Central America), lymphoma, eosinophilic leukaemia, sarcoid and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. It is important to measure the CSF opening pressure. If it is elevated, serial spinal taps might relieve the symptoms. • Fig. 64.1 Romanowski-Giemsa stain of the CSF sample revealing large numbers of eosinophils with red (eosinophilic) cytoplasm. (Courtesy Prof. Thomas Schneider) The Case Continued... A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid showed 1877 leukocytes/µL (reference value <5), with 42% eosinophils, 39% lymphocytes, 18% monocytes and 1% neutrophils (Fig. 64.1). CSF protein levels were elevated at 1.59 g/L (reference value <0.45), glucose was 1.85 mmol/L (reference range: 2.2-3.9). On microscopic examination of the CSF, no larvae could be detected. Ziehl-Neelsen stain as well as cryptococcal antigen were negative. There were no suspected malignant cells. CSF culture did not yield any bacterial or fungal growth. Urine and stool microscopy did not show any ova of Schistosoma species. Taenia solium serology was negative, as were Fasciola hepatica and Paragonimus serologies. Toxocara canis serology was weakly positive but did not show any change of titre on follow-up. HIV serology was negative. The initial CSF opening pressure was elevated, at 34 cmH2O (reference range 12-20). Lumbar puncture relieved the patient's headache and was therefore repeated twice, whereupon the patient felt markedly better. No further specific treatment was prescribed. She received iron tablets for a mild microcytic anaemia. The patient was discharged significantly improved after a 1-week hospital stay. Since the patient hat no symptoms any more no further treatment was prescribed. At 4-week follow-up she had fully recovered and her peripheral eosinophil count had returned to normal. SUMMARY BOX Eosinophilic Meningitis Eosinophilic meningitis is defined as the presence of ten or more eosinophils per microlitre of CSF, or eosinophilia of at least 10% of the total CSF leukocyte count. Invasion of the central nervous system by the food-borne nematodes Angiostrongylus cantonensis, and less frequently, Gnathostoma spinigerum, are the most common causes (Table 64.2). Rarely, neurocysticercosis, neuroschistosomiasis, paragonimiasis, fascioliasis, toxocariasis, baylisascariasis and trichinellosis can be associated with eosinophilic meningitis; however, the meningeal involvement is usually not prominent. Angiostrongylus cantonensis, the rat lungworm, is the most common infectious cause of eosinophilic meningitis. Humans are infected by ingestion of Angiostrongylus larvae in intermediate hosts such as fresh water snails and slugs; or transport (paratenic) hosts, such as prawns, crabs and frogs; or salad and vegetables contaminated with slime of infected snails. Once ingested, the third stage larvae (L3) penetrate the intestinal wall, reach the portal vein and from there enter the systemic circulation. A. cantonensis is a truly neurotropic helminth. Humans are dead-end hosts, the larvae die in the human subarachnoid space, causing an eosinophilic inflammatory response. To date, no standard of care treatment regimen for CNS angiostrongyliasis exists. Mild cases may be managed symptomatically with serial lumbar punctures and analgesics. More severe cases may be treated with corticosteroids alone or in combination with anthelmintic drugs. Corticosteroids (eg prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day) reduce the duration and intensity of headache. The use of antiparasitic drugs (eg albendazole) is controversial and the benefit of antipararasitic treatment compared to steroid use alone is marginal. If antiparasitic drugs are administered, they should be given with steroid cover. Further Reading 1. Heckmann JE, Bhigjee AI. Tropical neurology. In: Farrar J, editor.

       " \"A 32-Year-Old Man from Malawi With Pain in the Right Upper Abdomen and a Feeling of Faintness\\n\\nANTHONY D. HARRIES\\n\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 32-year-old man from Malawi presents to a local hospital with a history of pain in his right upper abdomen and a feel-ing of faintness, especially when standing up and walking. He was well until 1 month previously, when he began to experience a feeling of fullness in his upper abdomen. In the week before admission he developed pain in the right upper abdomen that was particularly apparent when sleeping on his right side. He has recently started to feel breathless on lying down and feels faint, especially on standing up. His past medical history is unremarkable, except for an episode of a blistering and painful skin lesion 3 years previously that affected the right side of his abdomen around the level of the umbilicus – this had healed spontaneously after several weeks.\\n\\nClinical Findings\\nHe is thin and slightly breathless in the supine position. His pulse is regular at 130bpm with pronounced pulsus para-doxus measured at 15 mmHg. Blood pressure in the supine position is 90/60 mm Hg. The jugular venous pulse is diffi-cult to visualize but appears elevated. The apex beat is impal-pable. The heart sounds are quiet but audible; no triple rhythm and no heart murmurs are heard. Auscultation of the chest is normal. There is an enlarged tender palpable liver measured at 8 cm below the right costal junction and evi-dence of mild peripheral oedema of the legs and sacral area.\\n\\nLaboratory Results\\nHaemoglobin 10.5g/dL; WBC 9.8 G/L (4–10). Chest radi-ography shows an enlarged globular heart with clear lung fields (see Fig. 66.1).\\n\\nQuestions\\n1. Based on the clinical history, examination and investiga-tions done, what is the most likely pathology to explain this man's illness and what would be the most frequent cause of the problem?\\n2. What other investigations should be carried out? Outline the immediate and long-term management of his condition.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nThis young African man presents with a history of right upper abdominal pain, breathlessness and syncope. On phys-ical examination, he has signs of cardiac decompensation associated with right heart failure. It is likely that his skin lesion 3 years previously was herpes zoster.\\n\\n• Fig. 66.1 Chest radiograph of the patient showing an enlarged globular cardiac silhouette with clear lung fields.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat Other Investigations Should be Carried Out? Outline the Immediate and Long-Term Management of His Condition.\\nThe most important investigation that should be carried out immediately is an ultrasound of the heart, which should show the presence of pericardial fluid and sometimes fibrous strands that are strongly suggestive of tuberculosis, especially in highly endemic areas. An electrocardiogram is useful in showing low-voltage QRS complexes and in occasional cases there may be electrical alternans. If there is pericardial fluid on ultrasound, the patient requires a therapeutic pericardial aspiration to relieve the pressure on the heart and restore car-diac output. Once fluid is aspirated and the cardiac output is restored, the patient should be started on antituberculous treatment and corticosteroids. An HIV test should be carried out with appropriate counselling, and consideration given to starting antiretroviral therapy after a few weeks if the HIV test is positive.\\n\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe patient underwent therapeutic pericardial aspiration and 500 mL of bloodstained pericardial fluid were aspirated. The blood pressure increased to 120/80 mmHg almost immedi-ately. The patient was started on standard first-line antituber-culous treatment with rifampicin (R), isoniazid (H), pyrazinamide (Z) and ethambutol (E) and also on predniso-lone at a dose of 60 mg daily. HIV testing was carried out and the patient was found to be HIV positive.\\nThe patient received a full 6-month course of antituber-culous treatment consisting of a 2-month initial phase of four drugs given daily (2RHZE) and a 4-month continuation phase of two drugs given daily (4RH), prednisolone in tapered doses for ten weeks, and antiretroviral therapy which was started at 4 weeks after commencing antituberculous treatment. He made a full and uneventful recovery.\\n\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nTuberculosis\\nIn Africa the most common cause of pericardial effusion is tuberculosis; and even if there is no confirmatory evidence of tuberculosis, patients must be treated with a full course of antituberculosis treatment. In countries in central and southern Africa there is a strong association between tuberculosis and HIV infection, with over 50 per cent of tuberculosis patients being HIV positive. The advent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa was associated with a large increase in the number of patients being diagnosed with tuberculosis pericardial effusion. Once in HIV-positive patients not yet on ART, a diagnosis of pericardial effusion is made, it is important to determine whether tamponade is present, with the characteristic features being syncope, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus and hypoten-sion. The presence of tamponade is potentially life-threatening and requires prompt pericardial aspiration. Diagnostic peri-cardial aspiration is usually unhelpful in the district hospital setting, because the fluid is often bloodstained and acid-fast bacilli are rarely visualized in smears of the pericardial aspirate from patients who have tuberculosis. If pericardial fluid is available for investigation, this can be examined with higher diagnostic sensitivity using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) – a fully automated and commercially available cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test - which allows a confirmed diagnosis of TB within 2 hours. The use of corticosteroids is recommended, especially if there is tampo-nade. In HIV-negative patients and HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy, randomized controlled trials have shown that corticosteroids may reduce the risk of death. For HIV-positive patients not on antiretroviral drugs, corticosteroids may reduce pericardial constriction. A commonly used regimen is prednisolone administered in tapering doses during the first ten weeks of antituberculous treatment. WHO guidelines recom-mend that antiretroviral therapy is started within 2 to 8 weeks of the start of antituberculosis treatment. Timely antiretroviral therapy reduces mortality, is associated with excellent immu-nological and virological responses and reduces the risk of recurrent tuberculosis.\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n1.

She\\nhas a low-grade fever, but her chest is clear.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow Would You Approach the Patient?\\nSJS/TEN is a clinical diagnosis. Once suspected, all poten-\\ntially causative drugs should be immediately withdrawn. If\\nin doubt, all drugs need to be stopped. In general, medica-\\ntions initiated 2 to 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms\\nare usually responsible. In this patient's case, the major cul-\\nprit drugs were nevirapine and co-trimoxazole.\\nThe patient at this stage only had a maculopapular rash.\\nHowever, patients with SJS/TEN often develop large bullous\\nskin lesions.

Topical\\nantiseptics will reduce skin colonization; however, wound\\ndebridement is not recommended. Steroid eye drops should\\nbe given in case of conjunctivitis, and early ophthalmological\\nreview should be sought to prevent conjunctival scarring and\\nblindness.

It is most commonly caused by drugs. In SJS, less\\nthan 10% of the total body surface is involved. If more than 30%\\nis affected, it is called toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).\\nBetween 10% and 30% it is classified as 'SJS/TEN overlap'.\\nThe extent of skin involvement is a major determinant for\\nprognosis.\\nIn Western industrialized countries, SJS/TEN is considered\\nrare, with an estimated incidence of 1 to 7 per million per year.\\nHowever, it is about 1000 times more common in HIV-positive\\nindividuals, and clinicians working in sub-Saharan Africa and\\nother high-prevalence settings need to be aware of this\\ncondition.\\nThe drugs most commonly implicated in SJS/TEN are\\nantibiotics (in particular sulfonamides, but also other classes),\\nthe antiretroviral nevirapine, anticonvulsants and allopurinol.\\nInfectious agents (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and HSV)\\nmay also be responsible. Host genetic factors also seem to play\\na role.\\nThe pathophysiology is yet to be fully elucidated. Because of\\nan unknown mechanism there is widespread apoptosis of\\nkeratinocytes and subsequent epithelial necrosis.\\nSJS/TEN often starts with non-specific, flu-like symptoms.\\nAfter several days a morbiliform rash sets in that becomes more\\nand more confluent. The epidermis may slough, giving rise to\\nflaccid bullae, leaving a characteristic denuded dermis\\n(Fig. 68.2), which causes intense pain. Conjunctivitis is com-\\nmon and may lead to scarring and blindness. Involvement of the\\noral mucosa and haemorrhagic crusting of the lips make it\\ndifficult for the patient to eat, drink and talk. Involvement of the\\nurogenital mucosa is very painful and may lead to urethral\\nstrictures. The oesophagus and trachea may also be affected.\\nDiagnosis can often be made clinically. Skin biopsies may\\nhelp rule out the major differential diagnoses such as staphy-\\nlococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome,\\nexfoliative dermatitis, autoimmune bullous diseases and acute\\nparaneoplastic pemphigus.\\nAll potentially causative drugs need to be withdrawn\\nimmediately. Treatment is supportive and there is no clear\\nbenefit of any other disease-modifying interventions. Systemic\\ncorticosteroids do not seem helpful and the use of IV immu-\\nnoglobulins is disputed. However, data from large controlled\\nclinical trials are lacking.\\nAccording to literature from the developed world, the case\\nfatality rate of patients with SJS is up to 5%; in TEN it is 30% on\\naverage. Primary causes of death are infection and multi-organ\\nfailure.\\nA severity-of-illness score (SCORTEN) has been published\\nto predict the lethality of patients with SJS/TEN.

       " \"69 A 22-Year-Old Male Farmer from Rural Ethiopia With Difficulty Walking YOHANNES W. WOLDEAMANUEL Clinical Presentation History A 22-year-old male farmer from rural northern Ethiopia pre- sents to a hospital in the capital with difficulty walking. His problem started 10 years ago when he woke from sleep one morning and noticed weakness in both legs. There was no history of trauma and no prodromal symptoms he had been in excellent health before. The weakness in his legs rapidly progressed over 3 to 5 days, leading to him needing a cane for mobility. He had no back pain, sensory complaints, sphincter disturbance or upper limb symptoms. The basis of his illness coincided with a period of drought and famine, when his diet almost exclusively consisted of grass peas (Lathyrus sativus, local name guaya), which is known to be drought-resistant (Fig. 69.1). Despite the monotonous diet, he had been engaged in hard physical labour on his family farm, where he was the main breadwin- ner, despite his young age. He lived with his mother and three sisters, who took care of household chores; they con- sumed a similar diet but of overall smaller amounts of guaya. During that time, several similar cases of weakness among young male farmers occurred in his village. His walking dif- ficulty finally meant that he could not return to farm work. At the age of 20, he moved to the capital city seeking an alter- native job. He migrated along with another young male farmer from his village who had suffered a similar fate; he had weakness in both legs and arms, which he had developed during the same period of drought. There was no history of cassava exposure in the region. Clinical Findings An alert young man with a normal mental state. The gait is spastic ('scissor gait'), with foot-dragging and toe-scraping (Fig. 69.2). There is mild bilateral lower limb spastic weak- ness of pyramidal pattern, with pathologically brisk deep ten- don reflexes and sustained foot clonus. Extensor plantar response is elicited on the right, while equivocal on the left. Cranial nerves and upper limbs are normal. There is no sensory or bladder dysfunction. Laboratory Results Full blood count, liver and renal function tests, cerebrospinal fluid, nerve conduction studies and electromyography are normal. His HIV-1 serology is non-reactive. HTLV-1 and -2 serology and MRI are not available. • Fig. 69.1 Lathyrus sativus (local name guaya) grass pea plant and its leguminous seeds. • Fig. 69.2 Images demonstrating the patient's gait: paraplegic narrow-based 'scissor gait' with foot- dragging, and toe-scraping. Questions 1. What clinical syndrome can you apply for a diagnostic approach and how do you narrow down your differential diagnoses? 2. What management and disease prevention plans can be used? Discussion A male, teenage farmer from rural northern Ethiopia develops irreversible spastic paraparesis. The onset of symp- toms coincides with a period of drought when diet mainly consists of grass peas. There is no sensory deficit and no blad- der dysfunction. Another young male farmer from the same village is similarly affected. Answer to Question 1 What Clinical Syndrome Can You Apply for a Diagnostic Approach and How Do You Narrow Down Possible Differential Diagnoses? Upper motor neuron lesion with spastic paraparesis is the cli- nical syndrome. Absence of radicular symptoms, sensory level, sphincter disturbance, back pain, non-progression, HIV- seronegativity and negative family history rule out most com- pressive, hereditary, infectious and metabolic myelopathies. Among tropical myelopathies, HTLV-associated myelop- athy (HAM) is highly unlikely. HAM has usually an insid- ious onset and a slowly progressive course, bladder impairment and sensory symptoms are prominent. Neuro- cassavism (konzo) may also present with a sudden-onset spas- tic paraparesis but is improbable in the absence of cassava exposure. Male gender, pre-onset physical exertion, excessive prolonged guaya consumption and a history of similarly affected village members favour a distinct form of toxico- nutritional disease called neurolathyrism. Answer to Question 2 What Management and Disease Prevention Plans Can be Employed? Neurolathyrism is a preventable neurotoxic myelopathy leading to permanent disability. Treatment is symptomatic with anti-spastic drugs and physiotherapy. Tendon and muscle release surgery can be employed to lengthen contrac- tures of calf muscles and hip adductors. Walking canes, foot braces and wheelchairs need to be provided. Education to avoid consumption of L. sativus and mea- sures to reduce toxin burden are important public health interventions. New cases of this preventable disease continue to occur. Behaviour change communication among high-risk communities can promote positive practices to reduce toxin exposure. Such practices include the use of metallic cooking utensils rather than traditional clay pots to avoid accrued tox- icity from iron-induced oxidation, addition of antioxidant seasonings, soaking seeds in lemon water and avoiding unripe seeds. The Case Continued... The patient received physiotherapy and muscle relaxants; however, this achieved only mild short-lasting improvement of his spasticity. A walking cane and wheelchair were pro- vided. The patient was counselled to avoid further consump- tion of L. sativus. Further Reading 1. Aronson JK. Plant poisons and traditional medicines.

       " \"A 28-Year-Old Male Fisherman from Malawi With Shortness of Breath CAMILLA ROTHE Clinical Presentation History A 28-year-old Malawian man presents to a local hospital with progressive shortness of breath over the past 5 days. He reports orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. He has also developed bilateral flank pain in the past days, which is continuous and dull, and there is constant nausea. There is no cough and no fever. He was diagnosed with arterial hypertension 2 years earlier and prescribed antihypertensive drugs, which he never took. No investigations were done at that time. His medical history and family history are otherwise unremarkable. A recent HIV test was negative. The patient is a fisherman from a town on the southern shore of Lake Malawi. Clinical Findings The 28-year-old man is not looking chronically ill, but is in respiratory distress. His conjunctivae are notably pale. His blood pressure is 200/130 mmHg, pulse 66 bpm, temperature 36.8°C and respiratory rate 32 breath cycles per minute. His apex beat is slightly displaced, but his heart sounds are clear and regular. The jugular venous pressure is not raised. There are bilateral fine crackles over the lung bases. The abdomen is flat and non-tender. There is bilateral renal angle tenderness, and the kidneys are ballottable. There is no peripheral oedema. Laboratory Results His laboratory results on admission are shown in Table 7.1. Parameter Patient Reference Range WBC (×109/L) 3.8 4-10 Haemoglobin (mg/dL) 6.0 13-15 MCV (fL) 92 80-99 Platelets (×109/L) 187 150-400 Creatinine (µmol/L) 1200 <120 BUN (mmol/L) 89.3 <17.9 K+ (mmol/l) 7.2 3.5-5.2 Imaging His chest radiograph on admission is shown in Figure 7.1. Questions 1. What is your clinical impression? 2. What further investigations would you do to establish the diagnosis? Discussion A young Malawian fisherman presents with signs and symptoms of left ventricular heart failure, hypertension and anaemia. There is renal angle tenderness, and his kidneys appear enlarged. His creatinine is very high and he is hyperkalaemic. Answer to Question 1 What Is Your Clinical Impression? This young man presents with combined left-sided cardiac failure and renal failure. He was diagnosed with hypertension 2 years prior. It is unclear if his renal incompetence is a cause or the result of his raised blood pressure. The reason for the enlargement of his kidneys could either be primary (e.g. polycystic kidneys) or secondary as a result of post-renal obstruction with hydronephrosis. In renal compromise secondary to hypertension, one would expect the kidneys to be small. Being a fisherman, the patient has been in regular contact with Schistosoma haematobium-infested water in Lake Malawi. Chronic schistosomiasis with hydronephrosis is one of the top differential diagnoses to suspect. Answer to Question 2 What Further Investigations Would You Like to Perform to Establish the Diagnosis? The most useful investigation at this point is an ultrasound of the kidneys to differentiate between, primary renal pathological condition and a post-renal problem. If there was hydronephrosis, obstruction at the level of the bladder seems most likely because both kidneys appear enlarged. On cystoscopy, endoscopists can macroscopically establish the diagnosis, but ideally, biopsies should be performed to look for evidence of granulomatous inflammation and S. haematobium ova in the tissue and to rule out neoplasia. In chronic infection, urine microscopy may be negative for ova of S. haematobium. The Case Continued... Despite high doses of furosemide, the patient remained oliguric. Glucose and insulin were administered for his hyperkalaemia. Ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis with massive dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces. The remaining renal parenchyma was very thin in both kidneys. Cystoscopy revealed a hyperaemic mucosa with multiple 'sandy patches' suggestive of granulomatous lesions in the mucosa. No tumour was seen. Histology was not available. The next day the patient deteriorated. He became drowsy and vomited repeatedly. He got progressively bradycardic, and there was a new pericardial friction rub suggestive of uraemic pericarditis. He was taken to theatre and a bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy was done. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and peritoneal dialysis (PD) was started (haemodialysis was not available). The patient improved rapidly, vomiting and drowsiness ceased and his friction rub disappeared. He was discharged home on PD. Two months later he was readmitted with fever and abdominal pain. He was treated for suspected bacterial peritonitis but sadly died 3 weeks later still in the hospital. SUMMARY BOX Genitourinary Schistosomiasis Genitourinary schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma haematobium is endemic in large parts of Africa and in the Middle East. Schistosomiasis is one of the most common tropical diseases in migrants from endemic countries and should actively be screened for. About 50% of Schistosoma eggs are shed through urine, the other half remain trapped in the tissue causing granulomatous inflammation. Around 10% of people infected progress to chronic late-stage disease. Risk factors for disease progression are poorly understood and include intensity and duration of infection, host genetic factors and parasite strain differences. Chronic infection leads to granulomatous inflammation of bladder wall and ureteral mucosa resulting in obstructive uropathy, hydronephrosis, recurrent bacterial pyelonephritis and end-stage renal disease. It is also suspected to contribute to the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder. The pathological changes can long go unnoticed. Egg deposition in the female genital tract may result in dyspareunia, chronic lower abdominal pain, ectopic pregnancy and infertility and has also been associated with an increased risk of HIV infection. Men may present with scrotal swelling, orchitis and prostatitis, haematospermia and oligospermia. In advanced stages of schistosomiasis, the proof of Schistosoma eggs in the urine is challenging because the adult flukes may have long died and egg production may have stopped. Biopsy is often unavailable and serology is unhelpful in an endemic setting, because it can only detect exposure without indicating the activity, duration or quantum of infection. A promising point-of-care diagnostic tool may be circulating anodic antigen (CAA), which is under development. The investigation of choice is ultrasound. Hydronephrosis and bladder wall abnormalities can easily be demonstrated. On cystoscopy a hyperaemic mucosa with 'sandy patches' may be seen (Fig. 7.2). Sandy patches are raised, yellowish mucosal irregularities associated with heavy egg deposition surrounded by fibrous tissue pathognomonic for schistosomiasis. Praziquantel may reverse the early stages of infection but has little role to play in advanced hydronephrosis. It may still be given to kill remaining adult flukes. Otherwise, late-stage urogenital schistosomiasis has to be managed symptomatically, which can be challenging in settings where renal replacement therapy is not an option.\",\n",
       " \"A 58-Year-Old Woman from Sri Lanka With Fever, Deafness and Confusion RANJAN PREMARATNA Clinical Presentation History A 58-year-old Sri Lankan woman who resides in a rural area presents to a local hospital with high-grade fever, chills, body aches, non-productive cough and progressive shortness of breath for 10 days. Two days previously she developed tinnitus and hearing loss. One day prior to admission she became increasingly confused. Clinical Findings On admission the patient is confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13/15 (E4 V4 M5). Her hearing is severely impaired (WHO grade 3). Temperature 39.3°C (102.7°F), heart rate 120 bpm, blood pressure 90/60 mmHg. There are enlarged axillary lymph nodes on the right side. There is no rash and no neck stiffness; Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs are negative. Scattered crackles are audible on auscultation over the bases of both lungs. Her liver is enlarged to 5 cm below the right costal margin and the spleen is just palpable. Laboratory Findings Her basic laboratory results on admission are shown in Table 70.1; her cerebrospinal fluid results are shown in Table 70.2. Her blood cultures grow no organisms; Leptospira and Salmonella serologies are negative. Leptospira-PCR is not available. A thick film for malaria parasites is negative as well. Further Investigations Chest radiography does not show any pathological changes. Her ECG shows sinus tachycardia. The EEG reveals widespread slowing; the CT scan of the brain is normal.

Questions 1. What clinical sign will you be specifically looking for? 2. What antibiotic would you include in your empirical regimen? Discussion A 58-year-old woman who is a rural resident of Sri Lanka presents in a septic state with confusion and hearing loss. On examination there is a regional axillary lymphadenopathy on the right side. She looks ill and is septic on admission. FBC shows a normal white cell count but slight thrombocytopenia. The liver transaminases are slightly raised, but bilirubin and AP are normal. CSF shows slight lymphocytic pleocytosis, a mildly raised protein and a slightly decreased glucose. Brain CT scan shows no abnormalities. Answer to Question 1 What Clinical Sign Will You be Specifically Looking for? Lymphadenopathy in the right axilla was detected on clinical examination of the patient. Her acute presentation with signs of severe sepsis make an infectious aetiology of the regional lymphadenopathy most likely. It is crucial to perform a meticulous examination in order to establish the port of entry of the microorganisms, which should be found in the skin area that drains to the enlarged regional lymph nodes. In Asia, infection with Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative pathogen of scrub typhus, is a common cause of fever, which is often associated with an eschar at the inoculation site and enlargement of the draining lymph nodes. However, the prevalence of eschar varies in different populations and its absence does not rule out the diagnosis of scrub typhus. Answer to Question 2 What Antibiotic Would You Include in Your Empirical Regimen? In Asia, scrub typhus must be considered in every patient presenting with an undifferentiated febrile illness, regardless of the presence or absence of an eschar. Therefore doxycycline should be added to the empirical regimen to cover for O. tsutsugamushi infection. Doxycycline would also cover important differential diagnoses such as other rickettsial infections and leptospirosis. Chloramphenicol or azithromycin is the accepted alternative treatment if tetracyclines are contraindicated, as is the case in pregnant women or patients with tetracycline hypersensitivity. Children at any age with scrub typhus can be safely treated with doxycycline. Of note, acute hearing loss or hearing impairment in a febrile patient from Asia should always arouse strong suspicion of scrub typhus. However, no single clinical sign or laboratory test can rule in or rule out scrub typhus; therefore empirical antirickettsial treatment is given based on clinical and epidemiological evidence. A definitive laboratory diagnosis if at all possible in the particular setting can be established by demonstration of seroconversion in paired acute and convalescent serum samples or by PCR on pretreatment buffy coat samples of an eschar biopsy. The Case Continued... On day 2 after admission the patient developed coarse tremors of both upper and lower limbs associated with saccadic oscillations of her eyes in all directions with further deterioration of level of consciousness (GCS 8). At this point a careful clinical examination revealed a well-demarcated crater-like lesion in the right axilla hidden within the axillary folds. Doxycycline therapy was commenced and the patient improved over the next 48 hours. She was discharged on day 6 after admission. Her hearing had returned to normal and there were no other neurological deficits.\",\n",

He is clinically well and does not report any complaints.\\nThe lesion was first detected 2 years earlier during a routine health check. Initially it was of linear shape. The patient has been regularly followed up since then. At his most recent follow-up visit it was found by chest radiography (Fig. 71.1A) and CT scan (Fig. 71.1B, C) that his linear lung shadow had turned into a nodular lesion of about 2 cm in diameter.\\nThe patient was born in Kyushu district, southern Japan, where he is still living. He has no history of travelling overseas.\\n\\nClinical Findings\\nThe vital signs were normal. The chest was clear. The remainder of the physical examination was also normal.\\n\\nInvestigations\\nHis full blood count and total IgE are shown in Table 71.1.

What further information should you obtain from the patient?\\n\\n• Fig. 71.1 Chest x-ray (A) and CT scan (B, C) of the patient showing a nodular lesion in the right upper lobe. (D–F) Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) with increased FDG uptake into the lesion in the right upper lobe.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nA 71-year-old Japanese man who is clinically well is worked up for a nodular lesion in his right lung. Blood tests reveal a mild eosinophilia and a slightly raised IgE. On PET scan the pulmonary lesion shows an increased FDG uptake.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Kinds of Diseases Should be Considered in Your Differential Diagnoses?\\nThe most important differential diagnosis for a nodular lesion with or without cavitation in the lung is either pulmo-nary tuberculosis or lung cancer. The PET-CT is unable to distinguish between a malignancy and an inflammatory lesion of other aetiology, e.g. an infectious process.\\nSystemic endemic mycoses (e.g. histoplasmosis, blasto-mycosis and paracoccidioidomycosis) may present with a wide variety of pulmonary lesions in otherwise asymptom-atic patients; however, they are not endemic in East Asia and the patient does not have a history of travelling abroad.\\nIn addition to abnormal findings on the chest radiograph, this patient shows eosinophilia and elevated total IgE levels. One therefore needs to consider the possibility of pulmonary helminth infections, especially of lung fluke infection (paragonimiasis).\\n\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat Kind of Information Should You Obtain from the Patient?\\nWhen suspecting lung fluke infection, it is important to find out if the patient may at any time have been exposed to this parasite. Paragonimus species are endemic all over Asia, in West and Central Africa and parts of Latin America.\\nIf the patient lives in an endemic area, or has a positive travel history, one should find out if he or she has ever eaten raw or undercooked freshwater crabs, which may harbour the infective stage (metacercariae) of Paragonimus species. Also, consumption of raw wild boar meat is a risk, because wild boar act as paratenic hosts, harbouring juvenile worms. Traditional medicine used in some East Asian countries may contain raw crab meat and juice and potentially act as a source of infection. However, some patients have a negative exposure history, and it has been suggested that even con-taminated fingers and cooking utensils may act as a source of infection.\\n\\nTABLE 71.2 Predominant Paragonimus Species by Region\\nRegion\\tPredominant Paragonimus spp.\\nEast Asia\\tP. westermani P. skrijabinia\\nSouth and South-east Asia\\tP. heterotremusb\\nAfrica\\tP. africanus P. uterobilateralis\\nNorth America\\tP. kelicottii\\nCentral and South America\\tP. mexicanus\\n\\nThe Case Continued...\\nBronchoscopy did not reveal any signs of malignancy. Cytology of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was negative for malignant cells and acid-fast bacilli. The QuantiFERON test and a wide range of tumour markers were negative.\\nIn view of the elevated IgE levels, the patient's eosino-philia and the fact that the patient originated from Southern Japan, paragonimiasis was strongly suspected and the patient's serum was submitted for immunodiagnosis of par-asitic diseases. Multiple-dot ELISA was strongly positive for P. westermani.\\nThe patient was treated with oral praziquantel 25 mg/kg tds for 3 consecutive days. The lung lesion gradually faded and eventually disappeared. His serum antibody titre also declined.\\n\\n• Fig. 71.2 Chest x-ray of a patient with acute paragonimiasis, showing right-sided pleural effusion.\\n• Fig. 71.3 Paragonimus westermani egg in sputum.\\n\\n• Fig. 71.4 Multiple-dot ELISA for helminthiases showing positive reaction against P. westermani antigen.

Paragonimus westermani is the most widely distributed species in Asia, but several additional species also cause disease (Table 71.2). Apart from Asia, paragonimiasis occurs in the Americas and in sub-Saharan Africa.\\nAdult flukes live in the lungs of a mammalian host (felines, canines, humans). Ova are coughed up and either expectorated or swallowed and passed in the faeces. When eggs reach fresh water, miracidia hatch and infect a snail (first intermediate host). After asexual multiplication, cercariae are released and infect a crab or crayfish (second intermediate host).\\nHuman infection occurs mainly via consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater crabs or crayfish contaminated with Paragonimus metacercariae. In addition, eating raw meat of wild boar, which is a paratenic host, is an important route of infection, especially in Japan. Venison (deer meet) has also been proven as the potential source of P. westermani infection in humans. Because the range of paratenic hosts may even be wider, eating wild animal meat in general may be a risk factor for this disease.\\nMetacercariae excyst in the small intestine and penetrate the intestinal wall. They pass through the liver and diaphragm, invade the pleural space and finally enter the lung parenchyma where they mature into adults and produce eggs. Juvenile worms sometimes migrate into subcutaneous soft tissue or the central nervous system to cause unexpected, potentially deleterious lesions.\\nClinical features of the disease are similar to those of pulmo-nary TB or lung cancer. Patients may have chronic cough, hae-moptysis, chest pain, fever, night sweats and abnormal findings on chest imaging. Pleural effusion (Fig. 71.2) with marked eosinophilia in the exudate and pneumothorax without apparent nodular lesion/cavitation may occur in the early stages and/or in light infections.\\nExtrapulmonary paragonimiasis may present as painless, mobile subcutaneous swellings. Migration into the CNS may lead to acute eosinophilic meningoencephalitis and epilepsy.\\nHowever, about 20% of patients are asymptomatic and the disease is accidentally found on routine chest radiography, when nodules, ring shadows or cavities are typically seen.\\nEosinophilia is prominent during acute and sub-acute infection but may be only mild or absent in chronic disease.\\nThe definitive diagnosis is made by detection of ova in sputum, BAL fluid or faeces (Fig. 71.3). However, sensitivity is below 50% in light infections. Instead, an immunodiagnostic screening test such as multiple-dot ELISA (Fig. 71.4) should be used in com-bination with the patient's history and additional laboratory results. Serological tests (e.g. ELISA) may detect early as well as chronic infections, and titres decline rapidly after cure. Prazi-quantel is the drug of choice. A course of 25 mg/kg tds for 3 consecutive days is usually effective against all Paragonimus species.\\n\\n• Fig. 71.5 Histopathology of the nodular lung lesion that was surgically resected after diagnosis of lung cancer based on FDG-PET imaging. Note the chronic granulomatous lesion containing numerous Paragoni-mus eggs (black arrows). Foreign body giant cells (white arrows) are also seen in the tissue.\\n\\nEven in paragonimiasis-endemic areas, physicians often do not pay much attention to this disease and misdiagnose it as pulmo-nary tuberculosis or lung cancer. Such diagnostic errors result in enormous socioeconomic loss, and create a mental and physical burden for the patient because of unnecessary hospitalization and laboratory investigations, surgical interventions and/or long-term medication. Figure 71.5 shows a typical example of such a case, in which postoperative histopathology revealed the presence of Paragonimus eggs in the resected nodular lesion, which had been diagnosed as a lung cancer by FDG-PET imaging.\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n1.

       " '73 A 21-Year-Old Male Migrant from Rural Mali With Massive Splenomegaly CAMILLA ROTHE Clinical Presentation History A 21-year-old male migrant from rural Mali is referred to the tropical medicine department of a university hospital in Ger- many. He has just been worked-up for splenomegaly and bicytopenia at the haematology department. However, the underlying condition could not be established. Clinically, the patient is quite well, he only reports inter- mittent fever, and some “heaviness\" on the left side of his abdomen for some time (the duration is difficult to specify). There are no night sweats and his weight appears to be stable. The patient migrated from rural Mali to Germany and arrived 1 year prior. During his journey he crossed Niger and spent a few weeks at a detention centre in Libya until he made his way across the Mediterranean and through Italy to Germany.

Tem- perature 36.1°C (96.98°F), BP 120/80mmHg, pulse 64 bpm. The spleen is massively enlarged (around 15 cm below the left costal margin), but there is no clinical anaemia and no lymphadenopathy. Heart sounds are clear and there are no murmurs. The rest of the examination is normal. Abdominal Ultrasound Spleen 21.8 cm in longitudinal diameter, the parenchyma appears homogenous. The liver is normal in size and the parenchyma looks normal. The flow of the portal and splenic veins is normal. There is no lymphadenopathy and no free fluid. Laboratory Results The laboratory results are shown in Table 73.1. Questions 1. What are the most important differential diagnoses in this patient? 2. How would you manage him? Discussion A 21-year old migrant from rural Mali presents with massive splenomegaly, causing a feeling of heaviness in his abdomen and reports intermittent fever. The symptoms have been pre- sent for some time. At presentation he appears well and is afebrile. Gross splenomegaly is the only abnormal finding confirmed by ultra- sound, which otherwise yields no pathological results. Labora- tory results show mild bicytopenia, normal LDH and almost 4-fold increased immunoglobulin M (IgM). The systemic inflammatory markers are not elevated. Blood films for malaria parasites are negative, but malaria serology is positive. Answer to Question 1 What Are the Most Important Differential Diagnoses in This Patient? Lymphoma or leukaemia is an important differential diagno- sis to have in a patient with splenomegaly and fever anywhere in the world. However, in our patient it seems unlikely, because the differential count is normal, LDH, CRP and ESR are not elevated and the specialist work-up elsewhere did not yield a cause for his complaints. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) can present with massive hepatosplenomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia. Patients usually have a history of fever and weight loss and appear severely ill, which our patient did not. Schistosomiasis is common in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Chronic S. mansoni infection causes liver fibrosis and secondary portal hypertension with splenomegaly and hypersplenism. Liver fibrosis in schistosomiasis (so called “pipestem fibro- sis\") is usually easy to detect on ultrasound. In our patient, the liver appeared normal, and the flow of portal and splenic veins was normal as well, making portal hypertension of any cause unlikely. Bacterial endocarditis and brucellosis may cause fever and splenomegaly; however, the spleen tends to be only moder- ately increased in size and there were no murmurs on ardiac examination. EBV and CMV infections may cause ongoing fever and splenomegaly. Typical laboratory features include relative and absolute lymphocytosis, elevated LDH and liver trans- aminases, which our patient does not have. In Africa, most people will be exposed to both viruses already in childhood. Our patient shows remarkably high IgM titres, positive malaria serology and a negative blood film. The most likely differential diagnosis for this patient therefore is hyperreac- tive malarial splenomegaly (HMS). HMS is the most com- mon cause of massive splenomegaly in tropical areas with stable malaria transmission. Answer to Question 2 How Would You Manage the Patient? An HIV test should be ordered in any patient from Africa with a history of fever and/or thrombocytopenia. Serologies for schistosomiasis and visceral leishmaniasis should be done and blood cultures taken for Brucella species and bacterial endocarditis. For HMS, malaria PCR should be ordered and anti- malarial treatment attempted. If splenomegaly remains unexplained, a bone marrow aspirate should be done to rule out a haematological disorder and look for intracellular Leish- mania promastigotes. The Case Continued... HIV serology was negative; EBV and CMV serologies indi- cated previous infection. Serologies for schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis were also negative, and the blood culture did not yield any pathogens. There were no ova of S. mansoni found in the stool. The patient received one single course of dihydroartemi- sinin/piperaquine and the reported episodes of fever sub- sided. Malaria PCR was still positive at follow-up 2 weeks later, but has remained negative since then. Shortly after treatment, authorities threatened to deport the patient back to Mali. A medical letter indicating that he was at high risk for splenic rupture, which at his home in rural Mali would mean certain death, was recognized and he was permitted to stay. The patient has been monitored for a total of 2.5 years at the time of writing. IgM levels took 2 years to get back to normal. The size of the spleen slowly decreased; but at his last visit, remained slightly enlarged (14 cm in diameter). At his last visit, the young man was well and spoke fluent German. He went to school in Germany and has learned to read and write. He planned to start vocational training to become a house painter. SUMMARY BOX Hyperreactive Malarial Splenomegaly (HMS) HMS, formerly known as tropical splenomegaly syndrome (TSS), is one of the most common causes of massive spleno- megaly in tropical regions with stable malaria transmission. Other important causes include lymphomas, chronic myeloid leukaemia, myelofibrosis, haemoglobinopathies, schistosomi- asis and visceral leishmaniasis. HMS is caused by an abnormal immune response to repeated infections with Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae or P. vivax that results in an overproduction of polyclonal IgM. IgM forms aggregates and immune complexes, which are phago- cytosed by the reticuloendothelial system, leading to massive splenomegaly and hypersplenism. HMS is more common in women than in men and mainly affects the age group between 20 and 40 years. There seems to be a genetic background, with ethnic and familial clustering. HMS has also been described in expatriates residing in malaria- endemic regions, and more and more cases are being described in refugees and migrants from malaria-endemic areas. Diagnostic criteria were proposed by Fakunle in 1982 and include splenomegaly extending >10cm below the left costal margin without any other cause, elevated IgM, elevated anti- malarial antibodies and favourable response to antimalarial prophylaxis. Even though commonly quoted in the literature, Fakunle\\'s criteria are of limited practical use for clinicians practicing in resource-constrained settings, where HMS is naturally most common because malaria serology and IgM levels are usually unavailable. Under those circumstances, clinicians are often limited to presumptive treatment with antimalarials of a patient with massive splenomegaly, and HMS may be difficult to dif- ferentiate from lymphoma. Patients most commonly present with symptoms of anae- mia and abdominal heaviness or discomfort, some report episodes of low-grade fever. Full blood count usually shows anaemia, bi- or pancytopenia reflecting hypersplenism. Malaria microscopy is usually negative, because parasitaemia is kept at bay and therefore very low. However, molecular methods such as PCR may be able to detect low-level parasitaemia, as highlighted in this case. Treatment of HMS is effective with antimalarials for the duration of exposure, i.e. in endemic settings, lifelong. In migrants living in malaria non-endemic countries, one treatment course of antimalarials is enough to eliminate parasites as shown in this case, and repeated courses are not required. However, even after clearanc of infection splenic size and increased IgM may still take a long time to get back to normal ranges. Further Reading 1. White NJ. Malaria. In: Farrar J, editor.

       " 'A 28-Year-Old Woman from Sierra Leone With Fever and Conjunctivitis BENJAMIN JEFFS Clinical Presentation History A 28-year-old woman presents to a small rural hospital in eastern Sierra Leone with a 6-day history of fever, weakness, sore throat and retrosternal chest pain. She has had loose stools twice a day for the past 2 days. She was seen in a local health post the day before admission and given a course of artemether with amodiaquine and amoxicillin, but she had continued to get worse on this. Her examination was unremarkable except some mild pharyngitis. On arrival in hospital she was treated with IV ceftriaxone and she completed the course of her antimalarial medications. Her malaria slide was negative. She remained on this treatment for 2 days but continued to get worse. On the second day after admission she develops conjunctivitis. By this stage she is very unwell and is unable to walk unaided. She has developed a cough and breathlessness. Physical Examination Axillary temperature 38.2°C (100.8°F), blood pressure 80/55 mmHg, pulse rate 100 bpm. On chest auscultation she has bilateral fine crepitations. Investigations Her chest radiograph reveals diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Blood chemistry shows mild renal impairment and raised transaminases (aspartate transaminase (AST/GOT) 514 U/L (<50 U/L)). Questions 1. What is the differential diagnosis? 2. What tests would you do and how would you manage the patient? Discussion A young Sierra Leonean woman has a severe febrile illness with pharyngitis, conjunctivitis and chest involvement. She deteriorates on broad-spectrum antibiotics and antimalarials. Answer to Question 1 What is the Differential Diagnosis? Adenovirus infections can cause conjunctivitis and pharyngitis but these are normally mild. Also, measles presents with fever, cough, coryza and a striking conjunctivitis. It may also cause pneumonitis, but at this stage you would expect to see a rash. Mycoplasma pneumoniae can cause a pharyngitis and pneumonia but is rarely severe. Other forms of pneumonia are possible but do not normally cause conjunctivitis. Leptospirosis can start with a non-specific febrile illness. Pulmonary involvement including haemorrhages is common and it can cause renal impairment. Patients with severe leptospirosis tend to present with conjunctival suffusions rather than with conjunctivitis. Typhoid can present as a non-specific febrile illness. You would expect the patient to eventually improve on ceftriaxone, but prolonged clinical courses in typhoid are not uncommon. Pharyngitis and conjunctivitis are usually not part of the clinical picture. Lassa fever is quite common in Eastern Sierra Leone, accounting for 16-20% of hospital admissions in some studies. All the signs and symptoms the patient has are consistent with Lassa fever. Answer to Question 2 What Tests Would You do and How Would You Manage the Patient? Lassa fever is a serious disease. It has caused nosocomial outbreaks in which many medical staff have died. Therefore all procedures should be done with caution and the possibility of Lassa fever should always be discussed with the laboratory. All specimens should be transported in sealed plastic containers. Serological and PCR tests are available for the diagnosis of Lassa fever, and an antigen-based rapid point-of-care test has been licensed. PCR tests are the most sensitive but are not available in most African countries. Antigen tests demonstrate the presence of the disease but may not detect low levels of the virus, especially if taken in the first days of illness. IgM antibody tests can show a high rate of false positive tests and may be hard to interpret. The patient needs to be isolated until the results of the Lassa fever tests are known. Because the infection spreads through contact with blood or body fluids, the use of goggles, masks, double gloves and disposable (waterproof) surgical gowns is recommended when handling the patient until the diagnosis of a viral haemorrhagic fever has been ruled out. The patient should be isolated in a side room, which should ideally have an area outside for decontamination (i.e. removing potentially contaminated clothing). Needles and sharps should be handled with care by experienced staff. After significant occupational exposure to the bodily fluid of a patient with Lassa fever such as a needlestick injury, post-exposure prophylaxis with oral ribavirin should be considered. The treatment for Lassa fever is with IV ribavirin, which is expensive and not commonly available. It seems to improve survival, particularly when given during the first 6 days of symptomatic disease, but the quality of studies on this are poor.',\n",

The patient is HIV-positive,\\nand her CD4 count is low. She is not yet on antiretroviral\\ntreatment.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nHow Would You Manage This Patient?\\nThe patient presents with a symptomatic seizure; there are\\nobvious lesions in her brain and she is HIV-positive with\\nadvanced immunosuppression.\\nTreatment should aim at both preventing further sei-\\nzures (antiepileptic treatment) and managing the underlying\\ncondition (causative treatment). The patient and her guard-\\nians should be counselled about the nature of her epileptic\\ndisorder, respecting their beliefs and attitudes. The choice\\nfor an antiepileptic drug should take into account the local\\navailability and costs for the patient. Phenobarbitone is the\\nmost widely available and most affordable drug in sub-\\nSaharan Africa, followed by carbamazepine. Newer drugs\\nwith fewer interactions and a better side effect profile, such\\nas levetiracetam, are not yet routinely available. Phenytoin\\nand valproic acid are also used but their delivery might\\nbe unreliable. Reliability of supply is an important factor\\nto consider, because the discontinuation of the antiepileptic\\nmedication might put the patient at risk of withdrawal sei-\\nzures. When starting a patient on phenobarbitone or carba-\\nmazepine, the effects of hepatic enzyme induction on\\nantiretroviral therapy and hormonal contraception must\\nbe considered.\\nSyndromically, focal brain lesion is the underlying pathol-\\nogy in our patient. Differential diagnosis for focal brain\\nlesions in an HIV patient with a new-onset seizure includes\\ntuberculoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\\n(PML), cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcoma, brain\\nabscess and primary CNS lymphoma. Neurocysticercosis,\\nwhich can occur unrelated to HIV infection, also needs to\\nbe considered.\\nLesions that selectively affect the white matter without\\ncontrast enhancement and without perifocal oedema are\\nstrongly suggestive of PML. There is no causative treatment\\navailable for PML. Commencing antiretrovirals is currently\\nthe only therapeutic option.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat is Your General Approach to a Patient\\nPresenting With New-Onset Seizures in\\nSub-Saharan Africa?\\nThe approach is influenced by (1) the high prevalence of\\nHIV and subsequent immunosuppression; (2) the high bur-\\nden of infection, including tuberculosis, bacterial meningitis\\nand tropical diseases, e.g. cerebral malaria; and (3) the lack of\\nresources, in particular, low availability of imaging studies\\nand antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).\\nCNS infections are a prominent cause of epileptic seizures\\nin sub-Saharan Africa. They can cause seizures during the\\nacute illness (acute symptomatic seizures), as well as weeks\\nor months after the acute episode, if the infection leaves\\nan epileptogenic 'scar' in the brain (remote symptomatic\\nseizures).\\nThree questions should be addressed when managing a\\npatient with possible epileptic disorder:\\n1. Is it actually an epileptic seizure/epilepsy?\\n2. Is there an underlying cause for the seizure disorder which\\ncan be identified and treated?\\n3. Does the patient require antiepileptic drug treatment and\\nfor how long should it be given?\\nThe available diagnostic and therapeutic means dictate\\nthe clinical procedure. Mimics of epileptic seizures such as\\nsyncope and psychogenic non-epileptic attacks (so-called\\npseudoseizures) must be considered. Here, the history taken\\nfrom the patient as well as from witnesses and guardians is\\ndecisive. Feelings of lightheadedness before the loss of con-\\nsciousness, pallor and brief reorientation after the fall are typ-\\nical for syncope. Psychogenic non-epileptic attacks are\\ncharacterized by eye closure, long duration and bizarre motor\\nmanifestations. They often occur when the patients are sub-\\njected to emotional stress, such as during spiritual rituals and\\nchurch masses.\\nIn all patients with unknown HIV status, HIV testing\\nshould be performed. In all febrile patients, a CNS infection\\nincluding cerebral malaria should be ruled out. Opportunis-\\ntic CNS infections should be considered in immunosup-\\npressed patients. In areas with high prevalence of T.\\nsolium, neurocysticercosis should be taken into consider-\\nation. In view of the limited resources, the diagnosis will\\nbe based on clinical and epidemiological evidence; hence,\\nthe knowledge of local distribution and prevalence of possi-\\nble causes is helpful.\\nWhen initiating antiepileptic treatment, the issues of\\navailability, including reliability of supply, affordability\\nand interactions between AEDs and the patient's medica-\\ntions, must be taken into consideration (particularly, antire-\\ntrovirals, antituberculous drugs and contraceptives).\\nTreatment of women of child-bearing age might pose\\nsome additional challenges. In all women of child-bearing\\nage, folic acid (5 mg/day) should be added to the regimen.\\nAEDs recommended for women of child-bearing age in\\nresource-rich settings with low HIV prevalence, such as\\nlamotrigine, are not available in sub-Saharan Africa and\\nmight have adverse interactions with ARVs, especially prote-\\nase inhibitors. In those cases where several AEDs are avail-\\nable, the specific drug chosen for epilepsy treatment of a\\nwoman of child-bearing age will be a trade-off between the\\nhealth of the fetus and that of the mother. Here, one should\\nconsider that leaving out a drug because of its possible fetal\\ntoxicity, such as valproic acid, and using an enzyme-inducing\\ndrug with a better record regarding foetal malformations\\ninstead, might lead to a virological failure that would jeopar-\\ndize both the mother and the child.\\nCounselling the patients and their guardians is of para-\\nmount importance. An epileptic seizure is a dramatic event.\\nIn some African communities, epileptic disorder is still\\nattributed to supernatural causes. Patients who have experi-\\nenced epileptic seizures might become socially stigmatized.\\nPatient-tailored, non-judgemental counselling, taking into\\naccount the patient's perception of the disease, might assist\\nin securing the patient's cooperation. Involving local health\\nworkers from the community might help overcome miscon-\\nceptions and reduce stigma.\",\n",
       " \"76 A 55-Year Old Woman from Turkey With Fever of Unknown Origin ANDREAS J. MORGUET AND THOMAS SCHNEIDER Clinical Presentation History A 55-year-old woman of Turkish provenance presents to a hospital in Germany with intermittent fever up to 39.5°C (103.1°F), night sweats, chest pain and fatigue. The patient had visited her relatives in Turkey several weeks before. There is a history of rheumatic fever in her childhood and mechanical mitral and aortic valve replacement at the age of 37 and 53 years, respectively (St Jude Medical prostheses). Clinical Findings The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits. There are unremarkable prosthetic heart sounds and a systolic grade 1 murmur over the aortic area without radia- tion. Liver and spleen are not enlarged. No lymph nodes are palpable. No haemorrhages or petechiae are detectable. Laboratory Results There is slight anaemia (Hb 11.5g/dL [reference >12g/dL]). White blood cell count, lymphocyte-neutrophil ratio and platelet count are within normal limits. The C-reactive protein is 15 mg/dL (reference <0.5mg/dL). Serum creatinine and transaminases are not elevated. Blood cultures are negative. Urinary cultures yield Enterobacteriaceae. Additional Investigations Chest radiography shows no infiltrates. Transthoracic echo- cardiography demonstrates competent prosthetic valves. The patient is diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with co-trimoxazole. Her fever settles and the patient's condition improves, but she complains of increasing dys- pnoea and eventually slips into congestive heart failure. Questions 1. What are differential diagnoses in this patient after deterioration? 2. What are the most promising next diagnostic steps? 212 Discussion A 55-year old Turkish woman presents with fever of unknown origin. She has travelled to Turkey shortly before and has a history of double heart valve replacement. Treat- ment with co-trimoxazole results in some improvement, but then the patient develops signs of congestive heart failure. Answer to Question 1 What Are Differential Diagnoses in This Patient After Deterioration? Urosepsis could have been the underlying cause of the dete- rioration in this patient. However, urinary tract infection is usually easily managed with a short course of early antibiotic treatment. The patient's preceding stay in Turkey should raise the suspicion of another infection not detected so far, such as brucellosis, tuberculosis or Q-fever. Answer to Question 2 What Are the Most Promising Next Diagnostic Steps? With two prosthetic heart valves, our patient has an increased risk of infective endocarditis. Transoesophageal echocardiog- raphy is indicated to rule out cardiac involvement. Cultiva- tion of blood cultures should be extended to up to 6 weeks in culture-negative endocarditis to reveal Brucella or Coxiella species. The Case Continued... After 4 weeks, the blood cultures taken initially grew Brucella melitensis biovar 2. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a large vegetation attached to the prosthetic mitral valve (Fig. 76.1). Treatment with rifampicin, doxycy- cline and gentamicin was initiated. The patient improved rapidly. C-reactive protein returned to normal after 6 weeks of triple therapy.

Finally, she gave her consent to a third thoracotomy, for prostheses exchange. After sur- gery she made a complete and sustained recovery. SUMMARY BOX Brucellosis Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonotic infections worldwide. Its true incidence is unknown, because it typically affects rural communities and it is difficult to diagnose. Hot spots of the disease are Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central and South Asia, Central and South America and Africa. The disease is caused by intracellular bacteria of the genus Brucella. The Brucella species most importantly involved in human disease are B. melitensis (goats, sheep, camels), B. abortus (cattle), B. suis (pigs) and B. canis (dogs). Brucellosis is most commonly acquired by eating raw or undercooked meat and offal or untreated dairy products. Also, close contact with infected livestock poses a risk. It is an important occupational hazard among herdsmen, dairy farmers, abattoir workers and laboratory technicians. Symptoms are non-specific, with fever, sweating, fatigue, weight loss, headache and joint pain persisting for weeks or even months. Its presentation as a non-specific febrile illness poses a differential diagnostic challenge in geographical regions where malaria and tuberculosis are highly prevalent and diagnostic resources are scarce, such as in sub-Saharan Africa. In the latter context, brucellosis is frequently missed as a major aetiology of fever, as has been shown from Tanzania. Brucellosis may involve nearly every organ of the body. Although endocarditis is a less common manifestation of the disease, cardiac valve involvement was the most frequent cause of death from brucellosis in the past. Definitive diagnosis requires the isolation of the bacteria from the blood, body fluids or tissues. This can be challenging as culture may take several weeks. In endemic settings, serological tests are often the only available diagnostic test and their inter- pretation may be challenging. Treatment of brucellosis requires combination antibiotic therapy of several weeks' to several months' duration to prevent relapses. The choice of the regimen and treatment duration depend upon clinical course and organ manifestation. Drugs most commonly used are doxycycline, gentamicin, rifampicin and co-trimoxazole. In the case of cardiac valve involvement, spondylitis or neu- robrucellosis, extended parenteral antimicrobial therapy is recommended. Patients with Brucella endocarditis will frequently require valve replacement in addition to antibiotic therapy. Further Reading 1. Beeching NJ, Madkour MM. Brucellosis. In: Farrar J, editor.

       " \"A 51-Year-Old Female Traveller Returning from Central America With Conjunctivitis, Rash and Peripheral Oedema ANDREAS NEUMAYR AND JOHANNES BLUM Clinical Presentation History A 51-year-old female Swiss traveller presented to the outpatient department 6 days after returning from a 2-week holiday to Guatemala and El Salvador. Four days after her return, the patient noticed a generalized slightly pruritic maculopapular rash on the face, trunk, and extremities. There was no fever and no other accompanying symptoms. On the next day the rash worsened and a non-purulent bilateral conjunctivitis developed. The patient did not report any chronic underlying disease nor the intake of any medication. Clinical Findings The patient was afebrile. Upon inspection there was conjunctivitis and a generalised maculopapular rash, also involving the face. Additionally, the patient showed tender oedema of the hands, elbows, knees and feet (Fig. 77.1). There was also generalized lymphadenopathy (cervical, axillary, and inguinal). Laboratory results The full blood count was normal. CRP was 8 mg/L (<5) and creatinine was very mildly elevated (87 µmol/L, range 35-80 µmol/L). Liver function tests were normal. Questions 1. What are your differential diagnoses? 2. What diagnostic tests would you perform? • Fig. 77.1 Conjunctivitis, maculopapular skin rash, and peripheral oedema of the patient. Discussion Six days after returning from a 2-week holiday to Guatemala and El Salvador, a 51-year-old female Swiss traveller presents with a slightly pruritic disseminated maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees and feet) and a generalized lymphadenopathy. Answer to Question 1 What Are Your Differential Diagnoses? The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an arboviral infection, which is also in line with the putative incubation period. The three most important arboviral infections in Central and South America are dengue, chikungunya and zika. Dengue is endemic throughout much of Central and South America, and it is the most frequent arboviral infection in travellers returning from the tropics. Chikungunya was absent in Central and South America until the virus was introduced in 2013. After its introduction, the virus spread to most tropical regions of the American continent. Zika was absent in Central and South America until 2015, when the virus was introduced to Brazil and caused a pandemic affecting most tropical regions of the American continent in the subsequent years. Acute dengue, chikungunya, and zika infections have similar presentations and may be clinically indistinguishable. However, the presence of a skin rash, conjunctivitis and peripheral oedema in an afebrile patient is highly suggestive of a Zika virus infection (Table 77.1). Answer to Question 2 What Diagnostic Tests Would You Perform? When testing for arboviral infections, the kinetics of the different test parameters have to be taken into account. During the early phase of infection, viral RNA and viral antigen (e.g. dengue specific NS1) are circulating in the blood and can be detected by RT-PCR and specific antigen assays, respectively. After some days, viraemia is fading, terminated by the host's immune response, and viral RNA and antigen become undetectable in the blood samples, while now specific IgM and IgG rise and become detectable (Fig. 77.2). The diagnosis is made by the detection of viral RNA, viral antigen or specific IgM, or by the documentation of a ≥ four-fold rise of specific IgG antibody titres in paired (acute and convalescent) serum samples. In resource-poor countries, as well as in daily clinical practice in travel medicine, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for dengue (testing for NS1-Ag, IgM, and IgG) and chikungunya (testing for IgM) are widely available and often the primarily performed diagnostic tests. RDTs to diagnose Zika virus infections are under development. In our case, RDTs for dengue and chikungunya were negative. The Case continued... A rise in anti-Dengue IgG was interpreted as cross-reactivity which is common among viruses of the same family.

SUMMARY BOX Acute Arboviral Infection Acute dengue, chikungunya, and Zika infections have similar presentations and are often clinically indistinguishable. Although the pattern of clinical symptoms can point towards the correct diagnosis, specific molecular or immunological tests are necessary to make a final diagnosis. Interpretation of serological test results demands some caution, because cross-reactivity of antibodies directed against viruses belonging to the same family of viruses may be misleading. Although dengue virus NS1 antigen tests are mostly specific for dengue virus infection, serological assays may show cross-reactivity with Zika virus (ZIKV) specific antibodies (as in our case). The diagnostic value of RT-PCR for detection of Zika virus RNA in the blood is limited because viraemia is usually low and limited to the first few days after disease onset. However, Zika virus RNA detection in urine provides a feasible alternative: ZIKV is detectable with higher RNA loads and for a longer period (10-20 days after onset of symptoms) in urine samples than in serum samples. Arboviral infections are self-limiting and, in the absence of specific treatment options, clinical management is exclusively supportive. Special features of Zika virus include its sexual transmissibility, the potential to trigger post-infectious Guillan-Barré-Syndrome, and, in the case of intrauterine infection, its ability to cause severe foetopathy (primarily microcephaly).

       " '78 A 42-Year-Old British Man Living in Malawi With Anaphylactic Shock ANTHONY D. HARRIES Clinical Presentation History A 42-year-old British male expatriate who has lived in Malawi for 18 months presents to the local hospital emer- gency room with a florid itchy rash, difficulty in breathing and a feeling he is going to die. He thinks he might have been bitten on his ankle by a tick 2 days previously while out walk- ing in the countryside. Twenty-four hours after this event he noticed a circumscribed, painless, indurated lesion on the inside of his left ankle and this was accompanied by fever and arthralgia. He went to a clinic where a blood film for malaria parasites was reported negative. He was treated with paracetamol. On the day of admission, he developed a wide- spread itchy rash and shortly afterwards became progressively unable to breathe and felt faint. There was a family history of allergy. He had kept bees in the United Kingdom and had frequently been stung without ill effect. However, 9 months previously he had been bitten by insects while at Lake Malawi and had developed an asthmatic attack which resolved spontaneously over 2 days. Clinical Findings On examination, he is clammy, in a state of collapse and has a widespread urticarial rash. There is respiratory distress and stridor. There is an indurated circumscribed swelling on the inside of his left ankle (Fig. 78.1). His vital signs are: temperature 38°C, pulse rate 130 bpm, systolic blood pressure 60 mmHg. Chest auscultation reveals expiratory wheezes. Laboratory results Haemoglobin 17.4d/dL; white cell count 6.1 G/L (poly- morphs 85%, lymphocytes 10%); erythrocyte sedimentation rate 5 mm/hour; blood film negative for malaria parasites; chest radiograph normal; stool and urine microscopy negative. Questions 1. Based on the clinical history and examination and inves- tigations done, what are the possible causes of this man\\'s illness? 2. How should he be further managed? Discussion This male British expatriate presents with the clinical pic- ture of anaphylactic shock. He relates this to a tick bite he suffered few days prior. On admission is also febrile • Fig. 78.1 Circumscribed, painless slighly erythematous swelling on the inside of the left ankle. 217 218 CHAPTER 78 A 42-Year-Old British Man Living in Malawi With Anaphylactic Shock and besides his rash has an erythematous lesion on his ankle. Answer to Question 1 Based on the Clinical History and Examination and Investigations Done, What Are the Possible Causes of This Man\\'s Illness? With a story of possible tick bite, a positive family history of allergy, a history of bee keeping, an asthmatic episode after insect bites 9 months previously in addition to the dramatic clinical presentation of urticarial rash and anaphylactic shock, the initial diagnosis was of a possible hypersensitivity reaction to a tick bite. Other differentials to include are inva- sive helminthiasis such as acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome), acute fascioliasis and Loeffler\\'s syndrome (the acute pulmonary stage of infection with Ascaris lumbricoides); rickettsial disease; and connective tissue disease. Both in allergic reactions and in invasive helminth infections though, eosinophilia would be typical which is absent in this case. Answer to Question 2 How Should He Be Further Managed? A firm diagnosis has not been made and he needs to remain in the hospital under observation receiving treatment as needed for his intermittent allergic manifestations. The Case Continued... A diagnosis of anaphylactic shock is made and 0.5ml of 1:1000 adrenaline is given by deep intramuscular injection with good effect. He is admitted to hospital and over the next 2 days he is treated with intermittent injections of intramus- cular adrenaline, intravenous hydrocortisone and oral anti- histaminics for intermittent episodes of widespread urticaria associated with stridor and audible wheezing. On day 3 of his hospital admission, his condition changes. The stridor and wheezing cease, the urticarial rash is replaced by a diffuse erythematous rash (Fig. 78.2), his face becomes slightly puffy, he has a bad headache and a sustained fever of 38 to 39°C. On direct enquiry, he says he visited a national game park 2 weeks before this current illness where he has suffered numerous painful bites by tsetse flies. The fever, headache, puffy face and erythematous rash suggest trypano- somiasis and the circumscribed swelling on the ankle is now recognized to be a “trypanosomal chancre”. A thick blood film reveals 5 to 10 trypanosomes per high power field and the diagnosis of trypanosomiasis is confirmed. He is given a test dose of suramin 0.25 g with no ill effect, 0.5 g 2 days later, 1.0 g another 2 days later and this is followed by weekly doses of 1.0 g to a total of 5.75g suramin without ill effect. 24 hours after the first dose of suramin, his cerebro- spinal fluid (CSF) is examined by lumbar puncture to assess whether there has been central nervous system invasion – his CSF is normal. His urine is monitored weekly during the sur- amin treatment; towards the end of treatment his urine shows protein, casts and white cells, but these all disappear a few weeks after treatment has finished.

East African trypano- somiasis (Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense) appears epidemiologically and clinically likely. It is primarily a zoonosis, and animal reservoir hosts include domestic and game animals; its clinical course therefore tends to be rapid with a high case fatality rate if untreated. In contrast, West African CHAPTER 78 A 42-Year-Old British Man Living in Malawi With Anaphylactic Shock 219 trypanosomiasis is considered an anthroponotic disease. The parasite, T. brucei gambiense, is adapted to the human host, causing chronic symptoms and leading to the classic picture of \"sleeping sickness\", i.e. a chronic encephalopathy. The reasons for the dramatic presentation of trypanosomiasis with anaphylaxis as with the case of this patient can only be speculative, but his \"allergic\" preponderance may have made him hypersensitive to the invasive trypanosomes as they migrated from the subcutaneous tissues of the chancre to the blood. Gold standard of diagnosis is the demonstration of trypanosomes in blood smears by microscopy. Why trypanosomes were not identified in the first blood smear 24 hours after his illness started is not clear - they may not have been present in sufficient numbers in the blood at that stage or they may have been missed by the laboratory technician who was focused on searching for malaria parasites. Suramin is the treatment of choice for early stage East African trypanosomiasis (Table 78.1). It needs to be administered carefully with an initial test dose in case of hypersensitivity reactions. It is potentially nephrotoxic, hence the need for urine monitoring. In all cases of trypanosomiasis, it is essential to check the CSF for stage determination. It is best to perform the lumbar puncture 24 hours after the first dose of suramin to avoid introducing trypanosomes from the blood into the CSF during lumbar puncture. If there are >5 cells/µl in the CSF or try- panosomes are found, this is considered stage 2 (neurological involvement). Treatment in case of second stage East African trypanosomiasis is with melarsoprol, a trivalent arsenical drug with severe potential toxic effects (Table 78.1). Further Reading 1.

       " '79 A 34-Year-Old Male Immigrant from Peru With Chronic Diarrhoea and Severe Weight Loss THOMAS WEITZEL AND CRISTINA GOENS Clinical Presentation History A 34-year-old man presents to a hospital in Chile with a 6- month history of severe chronic diarrhoea associated with colicky abdominal pain and weight loss of approximately 20 kg. For more than 12 years he has suffered from recur- rent episodes of diarrhoea and abdominal cramps; the fre- quency of these episodes appears to have increased in the past 2 years. The patient originates from northern Peru but has been living in Chile for the past 9 years. He reports that his Peru- vian wife and children are healthy, but that his mother and one brother suffered from chronic abdominal symptoms of unknown origin, leading to wasting and subsequent death at the age of 45 and 28 years, respectively. Clinical Findings The patient is cachectic with a severe loss of muscle mass and a body weight of 44 kg (BMI 17). Apart from slight pain on abdominal palpation, the physical examination is normal: He is afebrile, liver and spleen are not enlarged, there is no palpable lymphadenopathy and no peripheral oedema. Laboratory results His laboratory results on admission are shown in Table 79.1. Other Investigations Abdominal CT scan and abdominal MRI are without any pathological findings. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy appeared macroscopically normal. Histology of a duodenal biopsy is shown in Fig. 79.1.

Questions 1. Which helminth infections can cause such clinical manifes- tations and which parasitological examination(s) should urgently be performed to clarify the histopathology report? 2. Would you order any additional investigations? Discussion A migrant of Peruvian origin living in Chile presents with chronic diarrhoea and abdominal pain, leading to severe weight loss and cachexia. Laboratory values show signs of malabsorption and inflammation. The physical examination, abdominal imaging and upper GI endoscopy are unremark- able, but the pathologist reports structures compatible with helminth infection in duodenal biopsies. Answer to Question 1 Which Helminth Infections Can Cause Such Clinical Manifestations and Which Parasitological Examination(s) Should Urgently Be Performed to Clarify the Histopathology Report? Chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption and wasting are usually not associated with intestinal helminth infections. Therefore diagnosis and treatment are often delayed. The two main hel- minth species capable of causing chronic diarrhoea and wast- ing are Strongyloides stercoralis and Capillaria philippinensis (see Case 58). In immunocompromised patients, intestinal protozoa such as Cryptosporidium species or Cystoisospora belli might cause similar manifestations. Our patient originated from northern Peru, a tropical region highly endemic for S. stercoralis. Routine ova and parasite stool tests might be ordered; but most importantly, specific tests to detect larvae of S. stercoralis such as an agar plate method or the Baermann technique should be performed. The latter has the advantage of being technically simple and providing results within a few hours. If stool samples are positive, respiratory samples and urine should also be examined for S. strongyloides larvae. Answer to Question 2 Would You Order Any Additional Investigations? Because S. stercoralis is the most probable cause of this severe disease, serology for HTLV-1 should be ordered. HTLV-1 is an important risk factor for S. stercoralis hyperinfection syn- drome, and Peru is endemic for this retrovirus. The family history of the patient also hints at this virus that is commonly transmitted by breastfeeding. The Case Continued... The patient was hospitalized and stabilized under symptom- atic treatment and parenteral nutrition. After the histopa- thology report was received, a fresh stool sample was sent to the parasitology laboratory for Baermann testing, which demonstrated a high load of rhabditiform larvae of S. stercor- alis (Fig. 79.2A). Numerous larvae were also present in respi- ratory secretions (Fig. 79.2B), but not in urine. Oral treatment with ivermectin (200 µg/kg per day × 7 days) was initiated and repeated after 2 weeks. HTLV-1 co- infection was confirmed by serology. The patient recovered from diarrhoea and other abdominal symptoms within weeks. Parasitological follow-up examination after 3 months was negative. At that point, the patient had gained 13 kg and was without postprandial abdominal cramps for the first time in more than 10 years. Baermann testing of the family and other household members revealed asymptomatic S. stercoralis infection of his wife and one of the two children. His wife tested HTLV-1 positive, but both children were negative. • Fig. 79.2 (A) Baermann technique showing high load of motile rhabditiform larvae of S. stercoralis in a stool sample.

Bone marrow\\ncultures have a better yield at all stages of disease.\\nCT-guided percutaneous vertebral biopsy and subsequent\\ntissue culture and molecular analysis is the diagnostic gold\\nstandard in infectious spondylitis.

Cur-\\nrently, around 500 000 cases of brucellosis are reported to the\\nWHO each year, with global incidence rates increasing. B.\\nmelitensis is the most common cause of brucellosis worldwide\\nand mainly infects camels, sheep and goats. Frequent routes of\\nanimal-to-human transmission include consumption of unpas-\\nteurized dairy products as well as exposure to bodily fluids and\\naerosols during animal birth or slaughter. The possibility of air-\\nborne transmission requires special safety precautions while\\nhandling Brucella cultures in the laboratory (biosafety level 3).\\nIn the early stages, brucellosis usually presents as a non-focal\\nfebrile illness. Clinical signs and symptoms are non-specific and\\nmay include night sweats, fatigue, lymphadenopathy and\\nhepatosplenomegaly. Localized infection develops frequently\\nduring the course of disease and may affect the musculoskeletal,\\ngenitourinary, central nervous or cardiovascular system.\\nOsteoarticular involvement is particularly common (up to 40% of\\ncases) and often presents as peripheral arthritis, sacroiliitis or\\nspondylitis.\\nSerological diagnostic tests are widely available but fail to\\ndistinguish current from past infection in areas of high ende-\\nmicity. Blood culture has a high sensitivity in acute disease and\\ntissue culture is considered the gold standard in localized\\ninfection.\\nBrucellosis therapy generally requires a combination of\\nantimicrobials with activity in the acidic intracellular environment,\\nas well as a prolonged course of treatment to avoid treatment\\nfailure and relapse. Preferred drug combinations of brucellosis\\nare doxycylin plus an aminoglycoside (streptomycin or genta-\\nmicin) or plus rifampicin. In neurobrucellosis, ceftriaxone is\\ncombined with doxycyclin and rifampicin. If contraindications\\noccur, ciprofloxacin and cotrimoxazole may be used. Treatment\\nduration is between six weeks and several months depending\\nupon organ manifestation and severity.\\nAlthough most osteoarticular complications can be treated\\nwith a standard course of 6 weeks' duration, brucella spondylitis\\nrequires prolonged treatment for at least 12 weeks to avoid\\nrelapse. Furthermore, surgical intervention may be required in\\ncases of vertebral instability or epidural and paravertebral\\nabscess formation.\\nFurther Reading\\n1. Beeching NJ, Monir Makdour M.

       " \"A 31-Year-Old Man from Guatemala With Acute Weakness and Numbness of the Leg\\nCESAR G. BERTO AND CHRISTINA M. COYLE\\nClinical presentation\\nHistory\\nA 31-year-old Guatemalan man with no past medical history presents to a hospital in New York City with several minutes of weakness and numbness of the leg. His symptoms resolved just before his arrival at the hospital. Two weeks previously, he also had two episodes of facial twitching that subsided without intervention after 10 seconds.\\nHe was born and lived in a rural area of Guatemala before immigrating to New York 5 years ago. In Guatemala, his family owned uncorralled pigs and his house did not have sanitation services.\\nClinical Findings\\nHis vitals were normal. Cranial nerves were intact. Motor and sensory examinations were normal. Deep tendon reflexes and gait was normal. The rest of the exam was unremarkable.\\nLaboratory Results\\nCell blood count and serum chemistry were within normal limits.\\nImaging\\nThe computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on admission are shown in Figures 82.1 and 82.2. A CT angiography showed patent cerebral arteries.\\nQuestions\\n1. What is the most likely diagnosis and what is the patho-physiology of this disease?\\n2. What is the approach to diagnosis and treatment?\\nDiscussion\\nA young, previously healthy man from Guatemala presents with transitory ischemic attack. Imaging reveals parenchymal calcified lesions, complex cystic structures in the subarach-noid space and an old lacunar infarct proximal to a cyst with a normal CT angiography.\\nThe clinical expression of neurocysticercosis is pleomorphic and depends on the location, burden of disease and host inflammatory response. Disease in the parenchyma behaves differently from neurocysticercosis involving the extra-parenchymal space. Therefore clinical presentation and therapeutic interventions for each location are different. Sub-arachnoid neurocysticercosis (SANCC) is probably the most severe form of neurocysticercosis. In the subarachnoid space, the parasite can undergo an aberrant continued growth and reach large sizes, especially when it is located in the Sylvian fissure. SANCC also has a high frequency of concomitant asymptomatic spinal involvement. Therefore an MRI of the spine should always be included.\\nThe pathogenesis of the subarachnoid form is largely mediated by the host's inflammatory response. Clinically, it can manifest as meningitis, communicating hydrocepha-lus, focal neurological symptoms and cerebrovascular disease. Increased intracranial pressure because of hydrocephalus is the most common presentation. Vascular involvement is a common, but frequently unrecognized manifestation of SANCC. The inflammation of the vessel can result in occlu-sive endarteritis, aneurysm formation and thrombosis. Small perforating vessels are most affected, resulting in lacunar infarcts proximal to cysts as seen in this patient. In many instances, the CT angiography will be negative.\\n• Fig. 82.1 CT of the head demonstrates multiple calcifications in the brain parenchyma (yellow arrows).\\n• Fig. 82.2 MRI of the head on T1 sequence reveals dilation of the suprasellar and Sylvian cistern (yellow arrow). Peripheral enhancement (orange arrow) is evidenced after the administration of gadolinium. Corre-sponding fluid filled septated cystic lesions (blue arrow) are seen surrounding the proximal middle cerebral arteries on T2 sequence. An old lacunar infarct in the right frontal white matter proximal to an interhemispheric cyst was also found (not shown).\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat is the Approach to Diagnosis and Treatment?\\nImaging is the cornerstone in the diagnosis of SANCC. CT is sensitive at detecting parenchymal calcifications, but MRI is superior in delineating cysts in the subarachnoid space and assessing the amount of inflammation. The serological gold standard, the immunoblot, has a sensitivity of 98% and spec-ificity close to 100% in patients with two or more lesions; the sensitivity decreases in cases with a single or calcified lesion. The immunoblot is always positive in SANCC because of the high burden of disease. Circulating parasite antigen pro-vides additional information on the presence of viable cysts, and can be used to monitor efficacy of therapy.\\nPrinciples of treatment for parenchymal neurocysticerco-sis cannot be extrapolated to those patients with SANCC. Antiparasitics are always indicated in the treatment of SANCC and many experts recommend dual therapy with albendazole and praziquantel.\\nThe duration of treatment is still controversial, but cur-rent guidelines recommend treating until resolution on neuroimaging.\\nCorticosteroids are also critical to reduce the inflamma-tion secondary to antiparasitic treatment. A careful taper of steroids should be employed to avoid complications, such as hydrocephalus, meningitis, and vasculitis. Patients may need a long course of treatment with neuroimaging every 3 months to assess the clinical response.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nA serum immunoblot for cysticercosis run at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was positive. The serum cysticercosis antigen was positive at the beginning of therapy. A spine MRI did not show evidence of spinal involvement. The patient was begun on a high dose of pred-nisone followed by a taper, and dual therapy with albenda-zole and praziquantel. After 9 months of treatment, his serum antigen was negative and his lesions resolved on imag-ing. He has been followed closely with no recurrence.\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nSubarachnoid Neurocysticercosis\\nNeurocysticercosis is caused by the larval form of Taenia solium in the central nervous system. It is endemic in Latin America, Asia and Africa, where its transmission is favoured by poor sanitary conditions. The mechanism of transmission is faecal-oral and person to person, but requires the presence of free-roaming pigs to perpetuate the life cycle.\\nSubarachnoid neurocysticercosis is the most severe form because of the large dimension of the cysts, exuberant inflam-matory response leading to complications and slow response to therapy. Neuroimaging and serology are complementary for diagnosis. MRI is superior for the detection of subarachnoid cysts than CT, and the serological gold standard is the immunoblot. Compared with the parenchymal form, SANCC needs a longer duration and usually double the antiparasitic treatment along with corticosteroids. Neuroimaging and serum antigen should be repeated periodically to assess for clinical response and decision to stop treatment.\\nFurther Reading\\n1. Baily G, Garcia HH.

       " \"83\\nAn 18-Year-Old Man from India With a Pale Patch on His Right Upper Limb\\nSTEPHEN L. WALKER AND SABA M. LAMBERT\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nAn 18-year-old man from India has noticed a pale patch on his right arm and forearm for 3 months. It is not itchy or painful, but he reports reduced sensation in the affected area. He also complains of mild numbness of the little finger of the right hand but no weakness (he is right-handed). Otherwise he is well. There is no family history of skin problems.\\nClinical Findings\\nThere is a 20 cm by 10 cm hypopigmented macule on the outer aspect of the right arm extending on to the forearm (Fig. 83.1). The affected skin is dry. The sensation within the hypopigmented area is reduced compared with the normally pigmented skin. The rest of the skin examination is normal. Both ulnar nerves are palpable, however the right ulnar nerve is thickened. There is reduced sensation on the tip and ulnar border of the right little finger. There are no other neurological abnormalities.\\nQuestions\\n1. What common skin conditions cause hypopigmentation?\\n2. What further investigations are required?\\nDiscussion\\nAn 18-year-old man from India presents with a hypopigmented macular lesion on the right arm with reduced sensation.\\nA hypopigmented anaesthetic patch is a cardinal sign of leprosy. The combination of a skin problem and signs of a neuropathy should always raise the suspicion of leprosy.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Common Skin Conditions Cause Hypopigmentation?\\nHypopigmented skin lesions are very common. Hypopigmentation may be a non-specific sequela of any inflammatory or traumatic process such as dermatitis or a burn.\\n• Fig. 83.1 A hypopigmented macular skin lesion with reduced sensation on the right arm of an 18-year-old Indian male.\\nCommon causes of hypopigmentation include pityriasis alba, pityriasis versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis. Vitiligo causes depigmentation rather than hypopigmentation. In leprosy-endemic countries any skin problem causing reduced pigmentation may cause an individual to seek advice because of concern about leprosy. Leprosy awareness campaigns often advise people to get pale patches checked.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat Additional Investigations are Required?\\nNo additional investigations are required because the patient has the two clinical cardinal signs of leprosy – a hypopigmented skin lesion with reduced sensation and a thickened nerve. However, where available, clinicians may elect to perform a skin biopsy and slit-skin smears. In this case a skin biopsy is likely to show granulomatous dermatitis with destruction of cutaneous nerves and a slit-skin smear is likely to be negative.\\nTABLE WHO Classification of Leprosy and\\n83.1 Recommended Duration of Treatment\\nNumber of\\nDuration of\\nClassification Patches\\nTreatment\\nPaucibacillary\\n<5\\n6 months\\nTABLE\\n83.2\\nWHO Treatment of Leprosy (2018)\\nOnce Monthly All Other Days Daily\\nRifampicin\\n600 mg\\n-\\nClofazimine\\n300 mg\\n50 mg\\nDapsone\\n100 mg\\n100 mg\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nLeprosy\\nLeprosy is a disease predominantly of the skin and peripheral nerves caused by Mycobacterium leprae (and Mycobacterium lepromatosis). The organisms cannot be grown in culture. The vast majority of individuals exposed to the infection do not develop clinical disease, but those who do develop a variety of clinical signs determined by their immunological response to the bacteria.\\nIndividuals with high cell-mediated immunity develop tuberculoid leprosy or borderline tuberculoid leprosy with one or a few hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. Bacteria are usually not seen in the skin biopsies or slit-skin smears of these individuals. Individuals who do not mount a cell-mediated response to M. leprae develop lepromatous leprosy with infiltration of the skin and many skin lesions. These individuals have lots of bacteria in their skin and nasal secretions.\\nThe World Health Organization categorises leprosy according to the number of skin lesions for the purpose of treatment with multi-drug therapy. Individuals with paucibacillary leprosy (five skin lesions or fewer) are treated for 6 months and those with multibacillary leprosy (six or more) for 12 months (Table 83.1). In 2018, the WHO recommended that all leprosy patients receive treatment with three drugs. The WHO regime is rifampicin 600 mg, clofazimine 300 mg, dapsone 100 mg once per month and dapsone 100 mg and clofazimine 50 mg daily on the other days (Table 83.2). Prior to this, patients with paucibacillary leprosy received two drugs (dapsone and rifampicin) for 6 months. Multi-drug therapy is provided free of charge to patients.\\nIndividuals with recent onset of sensory or motor loss (defined as within the last 6 months) are treated with oral corticosteroids, in addition to multi-drug therapy, to improve nerve function. In rare circumstances leprosy may manifest without skin changes - pure neural leprosy - which makes the diagnosis challenging.\\nThe diagnosis of leprosy remains largely clinical as there is no diagnostic or screening test for all cases. Presentations and clinical forms are very varied. The majority of individuals with leprosy do not have identifiable bacteria in slit-skin smears or skin biopsies.\\nFurther Reading\\n1.

What is the treatment of choice for cerebral sparganosis?\\nDiscussion\\nA 64-year old Japanese man presents with a generalized\\ntonic-clonic seizure. Imaging reveals an elongated structure\\nin the right occipital lobe. During neurosurgery, a live\\nworm-like structure is removed from the brain, identified\\nas a sparganum.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat is the Cause of Sparganosis?\\nSpargana are the larvae of zoonotic tapeworms of the genus\\nSpirometra. Adult worms inhabit the intestines of cats and\\ndogs, and produce eggs that are discharged in faeces. In fresh\\nwater, coracidia hatch from the eggs to be ingested by cope-\\npods and develop into first stage (procercoid) larvae.\\nWhen copepods are ingested by the second intermediate\\nhost (e.g. frogs, fish, snakes, birds), the procercoid larvae\\nmature into plerocercoid sparganum larvae and migrate to\\nthe muscle and subcutaneous tissue. The cycle is completed\\nwhen a carnivorous mammal eats the second intermediate\\nhost.\\nHumans can become infected by ingesting the first or sec-\\nond intermediate host, i.e. by drinking water containing\\ninfected copepods, eating undercooked meat from infected\\nsnakes, frogs, or birds, or by the use of poultices produced\\nfrom infested frog or snake flesh or skin on open wounds\\nor eyes.\\nIn the human body, the sparganum commonly migrates\\ninto subcutaneous tissue or muscle, and sometimes into the\\neye, the spinal cord or brain, the latter resulting in cerebral\\nsparganosis. The infection route in the present case was prob-\\nably through consumption of raw chicken meat, which the\\npatient ate approximately once a month before the general-\\nized seizure.\\n234\\nCHAPTER 84 A 64-Year-Old Japanese Man With Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures 235\\nA\\nAM\\nB\\nAM\\nFo\\n0\\nC\\n13\\nD\\nFo\\n+LPH\\n5cm\\n• Fig. 84.1 MRI A.

Cases have been\\nmainly reported from Asian countries, especially China,\\nSouth Korea, Thailand and Japan, and the most commonly\\nobserved clinical manifestation is epileptic seizures.

       " 'A 55-Year-Old Female Pig Farmer from Vietnam With Fever and Impaired Consciousness\\nTHI THUY NGAN NGUYEN AND JEREMY DAY\\n\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 55-year-old woman presents to a hospital in rural Vietnam with a 1-day history of fever, headache and vomiting. Her blood film is negative for malaria and she is treated with fluids and paracetamol.\\nOn the second day of illness she develops confusion and is referred to a hospital in Ho Chi Minh City for further investigation.\\nThe patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, she has been on treatment for 4 years. She raises pigs on her smallholding and works as a butcher in a local market selling pork and chicken.\\n\\nClinical Findings\\nOn admission, she is confused with a Glasgow Coma Score of 12/15 (E3 M5 V4), there is fever (38.5°C or 101.3°F), tachycardia (124 bpm), hypotension (85/60 mmHg), tachypnoea (32 breaths per minute), and hypoxia (O2 saturation 86% on ambient air).

What is the differential diagnosis and what empirical treatment would you give?\\n2. What additional investigations are needed?\\n\\nDiscussion\\nThis middle-aged Vietnamese woman from a rural area presents with a syndrome consistent with meningitis complicated by shock. She has a widespread non-blanching purpuric rash.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat is the Differential Diagnosis and What Empirical Treatment Would You Give?\\nThe patient presented at the rural district hospital with fever and malaise and developed confusion. There is malaria in rural Vietnam and both P. falciparum and P. vivax are endemic; therefore severe malaria must be excluded. Enteric fever, an important disease in low-income tropical countries, can cause confusion and should be considered, but the rate of disease progression in this case is uncharacteristic. Dengue fever is endemic in South-east Asia and should also be considered. Skin changes in dengue usually present with transient flushing erythema of the face followed by a diffuse erythematous, blanching rash on days 3 to 6. A small proportion of patients develop severe disease during a second, immune-mediated phase (usually on day 4-6). This phase may be complicated by capillary leak, shock, mucocutaneous bleeding and organ involvement. Dengue may also present as encephalitis.\\nIn this case the rapid deterioration with signs of meningitis and shock is not typical for dengue.\\nMelioidosis is another differential diagnosis to consider. In some areas of South-east Asia, it is the commonest cause of community-acquired sepsis, and diabetes is known to be a risk factor for the disease. Melioidosis may also cause brain abscess and encephalitis. However, melioidosis is comparatively rare in Vietnam, where the true burden of disease remains to be elucidated.\\nThe most likely diagnosis though seems to be acute bacterial meningitis complicated by septic shock. Globally, the common causes of acute bacterial meningitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Both S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis infections can be complicated by development of a purpuric rash; this is more common with N. meningitidis septicemia.\\nIn Vietnam, however, the commonest identified cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adults is Streptococcus suis. Like its counterparts, S. suis infection can cause both meningitis and septic shock; the syndromes overlap. A florid purpuric rash is common (6%-31% of patient cases).\\nOther forms of meningitis seen in Asia and the tropics include tuberculous and cryptococcal meningitis. Although each of these tends to have a more insidious onset, the duration of symptoms before presentation can be as short as 4 to 5 days; these diagnoses therefore should always be considered. However, they are not associated with shock or purpuric rash.\\nMeningitis is a medical emergency requiring prompt treatment. Lumbar puncture is the investigation of choice but should not delay administration of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. A typical choice is ceftriaxone; where resistance is suspected or common epidemiologically, vancomycin is also administered. The value of adjunctive corticosteroids in acute bacterial meningitis is difficult to generalize. Large studies in Africa found no benefit; this contrasts with Western Europe, where steroids reduced the risk of death, and Vietnam, where in microbiologically confirmed disease they reduced the risk of complications.\\n\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat Additional Investigations are Needed?\\nThe patient requires a lumbar puncture and blood cultures. CSF should be sent for microscopy, Gram stain, cell count, protein, glucose and culture. A simultaneous blood glucose measurement should be performed. If resources are limited, then CSF glucose with simultaneous blood glucose is the most important test informing clinical management, because a normal ratio (i.e. a CSF/serum glucose ratio of 0.6) excludes acute bacterial meningitis and TB. In both bacterial and Tb meningitis, the CSF/serum glucose ratio is expected to be markedly diminished. Rapid diagnostic tests such as pneumococcal antigen can be performed on CSF, blood or urine, and meningococcal polymerase chain reaction on blood or CSF if available. Because the patient is from a malaria-endemic area, the blood film should be repeated.\\n\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe patient received empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin, and supportive treatment including intravenous fluids. Lumbar puncture revealed turbid cerebrospinal fluid with 2870 cells/µL (<5), 92% neutrophils, protein 541.16 mg/dL (15–45) and CSF glucose 2.44 mmol/l (2.5–4.4). Blood glucose was 19 mmol/L (3.9–6.1), CSF/serum glucose ratio 0.12 (normal 0.6).\\nGram stain showed a Gram-positive coccus in short chains, and negative India ink, mycobacterial GeneXpert and Herpes simplex virus PCR. Repeat malaria film and malaria rapid diagnostic tests were negative. Five days later, both blood and CSF cultures grew S. suis, sensitive to penicillin and ceftriaxone.\\nThe patient received 12 days of antibiotic therapy. Dexamethasone was administered for the first 4 days of treatment. She responded to treatment but had residual bilateral hearing impairment.\\n\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nS. suis is the most frequently confirmed cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adults in Vietnam. Globally, it is an economically important zoonotic pathogen of pigs causing septicaemia, joint and genitourinary tract infections. Human disease is almost exclusively caused by serotype 2. It is reported globally but seems particularly frequent in East and South-east Asia. Outbreaks of severe sepsis have been reported from China. The prevalence of disease in Asia is probably driven by farming and food practices; disease is more common in those in contact with pigs and raw pork. Infection is rare in children because culturally they are protected from contact with pigs. Antibiotic resistance is rarely reported in human isolates. First-line treatment is ceftriaxone; adjunctive treatment with steroids reduces the risk for deafness in adults, which occurs in up to 70%.\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n1. Mai NT, Hoa NT, Nga TV, et al.

How Should She Be Followed Up?\\nA single oral dose of azithromycin (30 mg/kg single dose; maximum dose 2 g) or a single intramuscular (IM) dose of benzathine benzylpenicillin (<10 years of age: 0.6 million units single dose; ≥10 years of age: 1.2 million units single dose) is the treatment of choice. A four-fold fall in titre at 6 months indicates cure.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nShe was treated with a single IM dose of benzathine benzylpenicillin and the skin lesion resolved over the next 10 days. The patient was seen again at the hospital 12 months later with a similar ulcer on the right leg.\\nThe RPR test was repeated and was positive at a titre of 1:8. Given a greater than four-fold fall in the RPR titre this was considered cure after the recent treatment. The other leg ulcer was therefore interpreted to be of a different aetiology.\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nYaws\\nYaws is a chronic infectious disease caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue, which is spread by skin-to-skin contact in warm, humid environments. In the Pacific region, yaws remains highly endemic in the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, as well as in Indonesia and Timor-Leste. There is also evidence for a re-emergence of yaws in the Philippines were the disease was considered eradicated since the 1970s. The disease is also still endemic in parts of West and Central Africa. Yaws is normally seen in young children; it is associated with overcrowding and poor hygiene. The disease consists of primary, secondary and tertiary phases. The primary lesion usually starts as a localized papule 2 to 10 weeks after inoculation. Common sites are the lower legs and the face. The papule may develop into a large nodule 2 to 5 cm in diameter that ulcerates. Secondary lesions appear from a few weeks to 2 years after the primary lesion and may include a variety of skin lesions. Arthralgias and malaise are the most common additional symptoms and may be accompanied by early osteoperiostitis of the proximal phalanges of the fingers (dactylitis) or long bones (forearm, tibia, or fibula). Late-stage disease is characterized by destructive lesions of soft tissues and bones. Diagnosis is predominantly based on serology and relies on both treponemal tests (such as the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay, TPPA) and non-treponemal tests (such as RPR test). Benzathine benzylpenicillin and azithromycin are the treatments of choice, with the latter the preferred drug to use in mass treatment campaigns. A four-fold fall in the RPR titre over 6 months (for example from 1:64 to 1:16) is considered to indicate cure. Similar lesions to those of early yaws may be caused by other bacteria, in particular H. ducreyi, but PCR is required to make this diagnosis.\\nFurther Reading\\n1. Salazar JC, Bennett NJ.

       " 'A 27-Year-Old Male Traveller Returning from the Peruvian Amazon With Persisting Polyarthralgias\\nANDREAS NEUMAYR\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 27-year-old male Swiss tourist spent 3.5 weeks travelling in the rainforests of the Amazon Basin in northern Peru. During the second week of his stay he developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash.\\nThe rash started on the forearms about 1 week after the onset of fever and spread to the trunk, neck and face before fading after 3 days. In addition, there were slowly progressive debilitating polyarthralgias affecting the peripheral joints accompanied by transient joint swelling. He also noticed painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy, which was self-limiting, lasting for about 1 week.\\nThe traveller presented at the local hospital, where physicians made a clinical diagnosis of dengue fever, and he received symptomatic treatment with paracetamol. Although the fever and the other symptoms subsided within 1 week, the polyarthralgias did not improve, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting the small joints of the hands and feet as well as the wrists, ankles, and knees.\\nUpon return home to Switzerland a few weeks later, the patient consulted his general practitioner because of persisting, incapacitating polyarthralgias. The patient reported stiffness of the affected joints, mainly in the morning and after immobility. Physical examination of the affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation (swelling, redness, effusion). Laboratory tests were performed including serological testing for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella Typhi, and S. Paratyphi but none revealed a cause for the symptoms. For two more months, the joint pains did not improve; thus the patient was referred to a rheumatologist and subsequently to a tropical medicine clinic for evaluation of a putative travel-related cause of his polyarthralgias.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe physical examination was completely unremarkable. The affected joints did not reveal any clinical signs of inflammation (no swelling, no redness, no effusion).\\nLaboratory results\\nFull blood count was normal. C-reactive protein was mildly elevated at 9 mg/L (<5), liver function tests were normal.\\nQuestions\\n1. What are your differential diagnoses?\\n2. What diagnostic test would you perform?\\nDiscussion\\nA 27-year-old male Swiss tourist presents with persisting and incapacitating symmetrical polyarthralgias primarily affecting the small peripheral joints after returning from a trip to the Amazon Basin of northern Peru. The patient reports an acute self-limiting febrile illness accompanied by a rash before the onset of the polyarthralgias, which had clinically been diagnosed as dengue infection at a local hospital in Peru.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Are Your Differential Diagnoses?\\nTwo main differential diagnoses should be considered in patients presenting with persisting or prolonged arthritis/ arthralgias and a history of a preceding infection:\\nReactive arthritis (Reiter\\'s syndrome):\\nReactive arthritis is a rheumatoid factor (RF)-seronegative, HLA-B27-linked arthritis often preceded by an infection. The most common triggers are gastrointestinal infections (caused by Salmonella, Shigella or Campylobacter) and sexually transmitted infections (Chlamydia trachomatis). Reactive arthritis may manifest as monoarthritis (often affecting the knee or sacroiliac joint) or as oligoarthritis (usually of the lower extremities). The course may be additive (i.e. more joints becoming inflamed in addition to the primarily affected one) or migratory (new joints becoming inflamed after the initially inflamed joint has already improved). It usually develops within 2 to 4 weeks of the preceding infection. Reactive arthritis may also manifest with the classical triad of symptoms termed “Reiter\\'s syndrome”: (i) inflammatory arthritis of large joints, (ii) inflammation of the eyes manifesting as conjunctivitis or uveitis and (iii) urethritis in men or cervicitis in women. Other musculoskeletal manifestations include enthesitis (often involving the Achilles tendon) and dactylitis. In some cases, mucocutaneous lesions (circinate balanitis) or psoriasis-like skin lesions (keratoderma blennorrhagicum) may be present. Clinical manifestation may vary widely and patients may be oligosymptomatic. In the majority of cases the complaints are self-limiting and subside under symptomatic treatment with non-steroidal drugs over weeks to months.\\nViral arthritis:\\nAlthough self-limiting polyarthralgias are present during the acute phase of many viral infections, prolonged polyarthritis/polyarthralgias are characteristic for certain viral infections. Worldwide, parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, HIV, rubella and the alphaviruses are the most common infections to consider in the differential diagnosis. Although rubella has become rare because of vaccination, the vector-borne, alphaviral infections are becoming increasingly relevant in endemic regions and in returning travellers (see Table 87.1). Unlike reactive arthritis, viral arthritis primarily presents as symmetrical polyarthritis of peripheral small joints.\\nTABLE 87.1 Characteristics of Human Pathogenic Alphaviruses\\nVirus Epidemiology and Endemic Regions Occurrence and Number of Reported Cases Frequency of Main Symptoms (%)\\nChikungunya Tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Large sporadic epidemics Fever: 90 Rash: 40-50 Myalgia: 90 Arthralgia/arthritis: >95\\nAfrica and Latin America\\nSindbis Virus Eurasia, Africa, Australia, Oceania; Geographically most widely distributed Fever: 15-40 Rash: 90 Myalgia: 50 Arthralgia/arthritis: 95\\nGroup primarily reported from West Russia alphavirus (lack of data on human cases)\\n(\"Karelian fever\"), Finland (\"Pogosta Karelian fever: rare (no data)\\ndisease\"), and Sweden (\"Ockelbo Pogosta disease: ~140 cases (range\\ndisease\") 1-1282)/year\\nOckelbo disease: ~30 cases/year\\nRoss River Australia, Papua New Guinea, West ~5000 cases per year in Australia; in Fever: 20-60\\nPapua 1979-1980 an epidemic with >60000 Rash: 40-60\\ncases hit some pacific islands (New Myalgia: 40-80\\nCaledonia, Fiji, Samoa, Cook Islands) Arthralgia/arthritis: 80-100\\nBarmah Australia ~2000 cases/year Fever: 50\\nForest Rash: 40-60\\nMyalgia: 50-80\\nArthralgia or arthritis: 70-95\\nO\\'Nyong East Africa Rare epidemics; >2 million cases in Fever: 80-100\\nNyong 1959-1961 Rash: 70-90\\nMyalgia: 70\\nArthralgia/arthritis: 60-100\\nMayaro South America, primarily the Amazonian Sporadic single cases and small Fever: 100\\nrainforest, Caribbean outbreaks (involving ~10-100 cases) Rash: 30-50\\nMyalgia: 75\\nArthralgia/arthritis: 50-90\\nAdapted from Suhrbier, A., Jaffar-Bandjee, M.C., Gasque, P., 2012.

Beyond the acute phase, the diagnosis is based upon serological detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against the respective virus. Cross-reactivity within the same virus family is common. Reference laboratories therefore usually perform parallel testing for potentially cross-reacting viruses (see Table 87.2) and apply a two-step approach, using highly sensitive screening assays followed by highly specific confirmatory assays.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nGiven the patient\\'s travel history, the course of the illness and the clinical signs and symptoms experienced during the journey, Mayaro virus (MAYV) infection was strongly suspected. (Chikungunya was not yet endemic in the Americas at the time this patient was seen).\\nThe serological results (Tab. 87.2) confirmed the suspected diagnosis of Mayaro infection. The patient received symptomatic treatment with ibuprofen, and the polyarthralgias subsided slowly over the following weeks and months before finally disappearing completely.\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nMayaro-Fever\\nMayaro-virus is an alphavirus. Alphaviruses are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that circulate among a wide variety of wild animals in relative mosquito vector-specific and host-specific enzootic cycles; infection of humans (dead-end hosts) is exclusively incidental. The Mayaro virus (MAYV) circulates in an enzootic, sylvatic cycle (similar to that for yellow fever) involving forest-dwelling Haemagogus species mosquitoes as vectors and non-human primates as natural hosts. Infections in humans mostly occur sporadically, are strongly associated with occupational or recreational exposure in rainforest environments and represent spillover from the enzootic cycle. MAYV has so far been only reported from South America and the Caribbean.\\nMayaro infection presents as a dengue-like, febrile illness lasting 3 to 7 days. It typically manifests with chills, headache, retro-orbital and epigastric pain, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and a maculopapular rash (sometimes followed by desquamation). Haemorrhagic manifestations have been described but are rare. Like other alphaviruses, Mayaro may cause debilitating and long-lasting polyarthralgias, which are suspected to arise from the inflammatory immune response stimulated by the prolonged virus persistence in joint tissues. Treatment is exclusively symptomatic with non-steroidal drugs. Symptoms subside slowly over weeks to months. Permanent damage of the affected joints is not reported.\\nFurther Reading\\n1.

       " \"A 74-Year-Old Man from Japan With Fever, Nausea and Drowsiness\\nKOHSUKE MATSUI, KENSUKE TAKAHASHI, KOYA ARIYOSHI AND CHRIS SMITH\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\n74-year-old Japanese man is brought to a hospital with a history of fever, joint pain, headache, and nausea over the past 5 days. He has a history of cerebral infarction without neurological sequelae, hypertension and ulcerative colitis. He is taking antiplatelet, and antihypertensive medicine and subcutaneous injection of the TNF-alpha Blocker adalimumab once every 2 weeks.\\nHe lives in a suburb of a city in Kyushu district, southwestern Japan and has opportunities to encounter wild animals such as boars and deer. He is retired and does grape farming once in a while.\\nHe does not have any recent history of overseas travel.\\nClinical findings\\nOn examination the patient looks unwell and drowsy. His body temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse rate 101 bpm, blood pressure 120/70 mmHg, SpO2 96% with 71 oxygen, and respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute. Chest examination is normal. The Glasgow Coma Scale on arrival is 13/15 (E3V4M6). There is livedo reticularis bilaterally on his lower extremities but otherwise no rash is seen. His left inguinal lymph node is enlarged.\\nLaboratory results\\nHis laboratory results on admission are shown in Table 88.1.\\nQuestions\\n1. What are your differential diagnosis and diagnostic approach?\\n2. How would you manage this patient?\\nDiscussion\\nA 74-year-old man living in south-western Japan presents with fever, arthralgia, impaired consciousness and respiratory distress. Laboratory results show elevated AST/ALT, LDH, CK and low platelets.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Are Your Differential Diagnosis and Diagnostic Approach?\\nAcute fever with respiratory distress and impaired consciousness are signs of sepsis. Pneumonia, meningitis or infective endocarditis need to be investigated as soon as possible. In addition, considering the patient's lifestyle and habitat, tick- and mite-borne infectious diseases should be included in the differential diagnosis. There are two rickettsial infections and one viral infection that are transmitted by mites or ticks, respectively, in Japan: Japanese spotted fever (caused by Rickettsia japonica), scrub typhus (caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS).\\nSFTS should be suspected when a patient at risk of tick bite develops acute fever with thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and an elevated serum creatinine kinase. SFTS and rickettsioses are sometimes difficult to differentiate from each other because both show similar clinical manifestations and laboratory results. In this case, however, a negative CRP is suggestive of SFTS rather than rickettsiosis.\\nDiagnosis of SFTS is confirmed by detecting SFTS virus in blood serum by PCR. It is reported that real-time RT-PCR of serum is 98.6% sensitive and 99.1% specific.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow Would You Manage This Patient?\\nSymptomatic and supportive treatment such as adequate fluid administration and respiratory support play an essential role in management. Vasopressors should be started if the patient develops hypotension. Laboratory results have to be monitored closely because there are risks of worsening thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, multi-organ failure and haemophagocytic syndrome. Antibiotics should be administered until the PCR result is available and other infectious diseases have been ruled out.\\nMedical staff should be aware that there is a chance of human-to-human transmission through blood or body fluids. Contact precaution is needed until the SFTS viral load becomes undetectable.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe patient was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit immediately. Meropenem and vancomycin were initiated for possible bacterial sepsis. His blood sample was sent to the reference laboratory. Antibiotics were subsequently discontinued because no bacterial infection was identified.\\nDespite adequate fluid administration and other supportive therapies, the patient experienced worsening of his respiratory condition and protracted hypotension for a week. Noradrenaline was initiated, and then hydrocortisone 200 mg/day was added for non-responsive septic shock before he started showing gradual improvement. His platelet count decreased to 65 × 109/L on day 4 of admission but subsequently recovered to the normal level. His CK was highest on admission and decreased to the normal level on day 7.\\nHe was extubated on day 12 and discharged on day 35 without any sequelae.\",\n",
       " \"A 52-Year-Old Man from Vietnam With Evolving Shock\\nNICK JONES AND SOPHIE YACOUB\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 52-year-old man is brought to an urban hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam because of abdominal pain and vomiting. He describes 4 days of retro-orbital headache, lethargy, myalgia and fevers that had begun to improve over the last 24 hours. He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and poorly controlled hypertension. His last travel outside the city was several years ago.\\nExamination findings\\nThe patient is drowsy, but rousable. His Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) is 14/15, temperature 36.5°C, blood pressure 105/90 mmHg, heart rate 120 bpm, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute and peripheral oxygen saturation 93% on air. He has a weak radial pulse, but normal heart sounds. Respiratory examination reveals a dull percussion note and reduced breath sounds at both lung bases. He has mild abdominal distension, with shifting dullness and a tender 3cm liver edge. Skin examination is unremarkable.\\nLaboratory results\\nSee Table 9.1.\\nQuestions\\n1. What are the main differential diagnoses to consider?\\n2. What are the priorities for management?\\nDiscussion\\nThe short duration of symptoms before presentation is suggestive of an acute infective process, and the relatively low CRP and absence of neutrophil leucocytosis make a viral aetiology likely. Clinical signs of shock are present: tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure (<20 mmHg), reduced GCS and raised serum lactate. The degree of thrombocytopenia and presence of hepatic impairment are important markers of disease severity, and his raised haematocrit level is suggestive of haemoconcentration.\\nWhat are the main differential diagnoses to consider?\\nHaving presented in a high-endemicity area, the clinical picture is typical of dengue infection with apparent progression to severe disease with vascular leak and compensated shock. Even without an eschar, rickettsial infections, such as scrub typhus, are the most important differential diagnoses. Malaria should also be considered, but there is no evidence of haemolysis to support this, and risk of malaria is very low in most urban areas of Vietnam. Many aspects of the presentation could be compatible with leptospirosis, but the absence of suspected rodent exposure makes this less likely.\\nTABLE 9.1 Laboratory Results on Admission\\nParameter\\tPatient\\tReference Range\\nHaemoglobin (g/dL)\\t14.6\\t12.5-17.2\\nHaematocrit (%)\\t53.9\\t40-52\\nPlatelets (×109/L)\\t58\\t160-370\\nWCC (×109/L)\\t2.1\\t3.6-10.5\\nNeutrophils (×109/L)\\t0.9\\t1.5-7.7\\nLymphocytes (×109/L)\\t0.8\\t1.1-4.0\\nC-reactive protein (mg/L)\\t20\\t<4\\nUrea (mmol/L)\\t7.8\\t2.5-7.8\\nCreatinine (µmol/L)\\t114\\t62-115\\nAlanine aminotransferase (U/L)\\t812\\t7-40\\nAlkaline phosphatase (U/L)\\t260\\t30-130\\nTotal bilirubin (µmol/L)\\t18\\t0-20\\nLactate (mmol/L)\\t3.5\\t0.6-1.4\\nAnother differential diagnosis to consider in a diabetic from South East Asia with possible sepsis is melioidosis.\\nWhat are the priorities for management?\\nWith a diagnosis of severe dengue highly likely, supportive management of the patient's cardiovascular and respiratory systems should be prioritized. This involves careful fluid resuscitation, with thorough and frequent assessment for evidence of fluid overload. Ultrasound scans should be undertaken to ascertain the extent of pleural effusions and ascites; and if available, an echocardiogram could be considered to assess myocardial contractility and intravascular volume.\\nThe case continued...\\nThe patient is diagnosed with compensated shock and is admitted to a high-dependency unit for close observation and supportive care. Ultrasound scans confirm the presence of moderate bilateral pleural effusions and ascites, as well as mild hepatomegaly and a thickened gallbladder wall. He is infused with Ringer's lactate solution at a volume of 10mL/kg over 1 hour before his fluid status is reassessed. He remains tachycardic and oliguric with a haematocrit rise to 55.1%, therefore the rate of fluid therapy is increased to 15mL/kg/hr until sufficient haemodynamic improvement is shown. The rate of fluid delivery is subsequently reduced to 7mL/kg/hr for 2 hours and by a further 2mL/kg/hr every 2 hours until no longer required. Repeat clinical assessments are undertaken at two-hourly intervals throughout, with haematocrit checks every 6 hours. The patient is discharged from hospital 3 days later, after complete recovery. \\nSUMMARY BOX\\nDengue\\nDengue is the commonest arthropod-borne virus to infect humans, with an estimated annual incidence of 390 million infections worldwide. The virus is a member of the flavivirus family and has four closely related, but antigenically distinct serotypes. Transmission to humans is through Aedes mosquitoes; predominantly the daytime-biting Aedes aegypti. Aedes albopictus is a secondary vector in Asia, and its ability to survive temperate climates has allowed spread to many countries in Europe and North America. Although most clinically apparent infections result in a self-limiting febrile illness, a minority progress to severe disease with organ impairment, bleeding, capillary leakage and distributive shock. Severe disease usually progresses through three phases: a febrile phase of 2 to 7 days' duration, characterized by high fever, headache, myalgia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia; a critical phase with high risk of capillary leak, shock and occasionally bleeding at the point of defervescence; and a recovery phase, in which clinical improvement is accompanied by extravascular fluid resorption and organ recovery.\\nDengue diagnosis is confirmed in the first 4 to 6 days of illness by detection of the NS1 antigen by RDTs or ELISA or detection of viral RNA using RT-PCR, after which the sensitivity of these methods declines because of the short viraemia in peripheral blood. Paired serology tests for IgM/IgG can also be performed, (at least 3 days apart) demonstrating seroconversion; however, cross-reaction with other flaviviruses remains a problem, especially in Zika endemic areas.\\nWarning signs for severe disease include abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, hepatomegaly, and increasing haematocrit with concurrent worsening of thrombocytopenia, six of which were present in this case. With no antiviral treatment available, cautious intravascular volume replacement and supportive treatment are the mainstays of management, accompanied by careful monitoring for signs of fluid overload. In many countries the epidemiology of dengue is changing in line with aging populations. Older patients often present with atypical features and have higher risk of complications and death as a result of difficulties in controlling haemodynamic status in the context of high-level comorbidity. Uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes, as in this case, have been shown to be risk factors for poor outcomes. Promising attempts at vaccine deployment have been thwarted by the fact that re-infection of immune-primed individuals is associated with greater risk of severe disease; therefore the searches for effective therapeutics and a pan-specific dengue vaccine continue.\\nFurther reading\\n1.

       " \"A 55-Year-Old Couple Both Returning from Chile and Argentina With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\\nCORNELIA STAEHELIN\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 55-year-old Swiss couple, both fitness instructors, travelled for 3 months from Ecuador to Chile. The last month of their trip they spent hiking, camping and taking occasional mud baths in the Chile-Argentinian border region. On their flight back to Switzerland, the husband developed a fever (39°C, 102.2°F), myalgias and generalized weakness that did not respond to symptomatic treatment. At presentation at the hospital in Switzerland 4 days later, he continued to be febrile and felt too weak to walk to the toilet unassisted or even hold up a newspaper. He developed shortness of breath with oxygen desaturation and bilateral interstitial infiltrates were seen on chest x-ray (Fig. 90.1).\\nThe respiratory pathogen panel from a nasopharyngeal swab (including influenza A/B, parainfluenza, RSV, adeno-virus, rhinovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus and human metap-neumovirus) as well as an HIV test came back negative. The following day he was transferred to the intensive care unit for non-invasive ventilator support.\\nThree weeks later, his wife presented with similar complaints and was admitted to the same hospital. She deteriorated rapidly over the 24 hours after admission, developed cardiorespiratory failure and fulfilled fast-entry criteria for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Furthermore, she experienced multi-organ failure requiring hemodialysis, and she developed profuse bleeding from puncture sites in the context of disseminated intravascular coagulation. During the following days, she required mass transfusions of blood products.\\nClinical Findings\\nHusband: BP 90/55 mmHg, pulse 120 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 94% on ambient air, and temperature 39°C (102.2°F). No abnormal findings on cardiopulmonary auscultation.\\nWife on admission (3 weeks after her husband's admission): normal blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation, temperature 38.6°C (101.5°F). No abnormal findings on auscultation.\\nLaboratory Results\\nHusband, on admission: WCC 7.3 G/L (reference: 3.0-10.5), 35% band neutrophils; platelets 48 G/L (reference: 150-450); CRP 68 mg/L (reference: <5); glomerular filtration rate >90 mL/min (reference: >90 mL/min); transaminases normal.\\nWife, on admission: WCC 1.88 G/L; platelets 98 G/L; CRP 7 mg/L; glomerular filtration rate >90 mL/min; transaminases normal.\\nChest radiography at presentation was normal in both patients; however, during the course of the disease both developed extensive bilateral infiltrates with pleural effusions.\\nQuestions\\n1. What is your differential diagnosis for this couple?\\n2. How would you manage these patients clinically? Is there any need to consider particular hospital hygiene precautions?\\nDiscussion\\nA previously healthy Swiss couple in their mid-50s present with varying degrees of cardiorespiratory failure of 2 and 21 days, respectively, after their return from a 3-month trip down the western coast of South America. They spent the last month travelling along the Chile-Argentinian border. The cardiorespiratory collapse in the female patient occurs precipitously and requires ECMO treatment.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Is Your Differential Diagnosis for This Couple?\\nConditions that may present with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and possible multi-organ failure after travel to South America include influenza and other respiratory viruses. Of the viral infections, New World hantaviruses cause cardiopulmonary disease; their incubation period is comparatively long and human-to-human transmission has been described, which could explain why husband and wife presented 3 weeks apart.\\nPneumococcal pneumonia should also be in the differential diagnosis as a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia worldwide. Rickettsial diseases have to be considered: of the spotted-fever group, in particular Rickettsia rickettsiae, which notoriously causes severe disease should be on the list of differentials; and scrub typhus, which was long thought to be limited to Asia, has recently been described from Chile. Pulmonary plague is also focally endemic in South America. Fungal infections (Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcosis) also have to be considered. Severe malaria may cause ARDS and is a possibility, too.\\nGiven the bleeding tendency seen in the wife, most viral haemorrhagic fevers can be excluded based on the incubation time alone, which is well below 21 days for most endemic viral haemorrhagic fevers (yellow fever, dengue and the New World arenaviruses, e.g. Junín virus and Machupo virus). There is only one exception to this rule, which is hantavirus infections: their incubation time may be up to 35 days.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow Would You Manage These Patients Clinically? Is There Any Need to Consider Particular Hospital Hygiene Precautions?\\nBoth patients should be referred to a tertiary care setting, which is equipped to handle ARDS and haemorrhagic fevers. Clinically, securing cardiorespiratory function is the main priority. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated as empirical treatment until further results are back.\\nAlthough the aetiology is still unclear, a patient with respiratory symptoms must be treated under standard hygiene and droplet precautions (at least) to prevent potential nosocomial transmission. Depending on local hospital hygiene requirements, airborne precautions may be required.\\nThe husband was treated with non-invasive ventilation for 5 days. He made a full recovery after a month of rehabilitation. His wife experienced a dramatic course with nearly a full month on ECMO treatment. Multi-organ failure requiring renal replacement therapy and haemorrhagic complications with mass transfusions of blood products ensued. As a result of bleeding complications at the inguinal ECMO insertion sites (compartment syndrome and leg ischemia) ECMO was replaced centrally (Fig. 90.2). After additional bleeding complications at inguinal and thoracic insertion sites, she underwent several surgical interventions. Nosocomial infections followed, and she remained in intensive care for 5 months and an additional 12 months in rehabilitation. The mode of transmission remained unclear; both human-to-human-transmission and acquisition from a common source were possible.\\nSUMMARY BOX\\nHantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS)\\nHCPS is caused by ANDV. This New World hantavirus is endemic in the border region between Chile and Argentina. The vast majority of infections occur through inhalation of excreta from the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus), the reservoir host. Accordingly, outdoor activities are the major risk factor for acquiring ANDV infection.\\nThe incubation period is typically 2 to 3 weeks (range 7-39 days) in case of common exposure.\\nAfter non-specific prodromal symptoms over 2 to 8 days, the clinical course varies from a mild disease to its most severe form, HCPS, which is characterized by microvascular leakage and is mainly attributed to host immune response. It presents with rapidly progressing respiratory failure and precipitous haemodynamic instability because of cardiogenic shock and consecutive pulmonary oedema. Capillary leak leads to hypovolemia, which may further impair cardiac and renal function. A haemorrhagic course may occur, although uncommon.\\nDiagnosis is confirmed by RT-PCR from whole blood or by serology, either with presence of specific IgM antibodies or at least a 4-fold increase in IgG titres in paired samples.\\nThere is no specific treatment or vaccine against ANDV. The use of ribavirin and corticosteroids in ANDV infection still remains to be elucidated. Organ supportive therapy is therefore the mainstay of treatment. Patients should be transferred to a tertiary intensive care unit immediately upon suspicion of ANDV infection, because ECMO support might be required. Case fatality rate in patients with HCPS attributable to ANDV is 20% to 40%.\\nANDV is the only hantavirus for which person-to-person transmission has been described, though this occurs very rarely.\\nNosocomial outbreaks were first reported in 1995. The incubation period in such a scenario is usually around 20 days. Person-to-person transmission is much less common than infection by inhalation of rodent excreta and occurs through close interpersonal contacts in the hospital setting (caring for a person with respiratory or haemorrhagic symptoms) or at home (such as sexual contacts, deep kissing or sharing the same bed).\\nIn the nosocomial setting, standard hygiene and droplet precautions should be adopted, and it is recommended to treat the patients in a single room. During aerosol-generating procedures, however, healthcare workers are advised to wear high-efficiency respirator masks and ocular protection.\\nFurther Reading\\n1. Blumberg L, Enria D, Bausch DG.

       " '91 A 20-Year-Old Male from India With Fever and Quadriparesis REETA S. MANI Clinical presentation History A previously healthy 20-year-old man from southern India is admitted to a local hospital with fever and quadriparesis. He has had fever for 4 days, followed by tingling and weakness initially in his left leg, subsequently involving all four limbs over the next 2 days. He gives a history of a stray dog bite (WHO category III) on his left lower limb 1 month before onset of symptoms, for which he received five doses of anti-rabies vaccine (purified chick embryo cell vaccine), but no rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). Clinical Findings On admission, he is conscious and his mental functions are normal (GCS 15/15). His blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute and temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F). Neurological examination reveals a flaccid, areflexic quadriparesis. Laboratory Results His blood investigations including serum electrolytes, renal and liver function test are normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows 52 mg/dL protein (reference: 15–50mg/dL), 60 mg/dL glucose (reference: 50–75mg, provided a normal serum glucose) and 340 cells/mm³ (60% polymorphs and 40% lymphocytes; normal ≤5 cells/mm³). Questions 1. You are suspecting rabies. How could you secure the diagnosis? What are the differentials? 2. How could rabies have been prevented in this case? Discussion A 20-year-old male Indian with a history of dog-bite presents with fever and rapidly progressive quadriparesis a month after the incident. He has received a full course of five active anti-rabies vaccinations, but no anti-rabies immunoglobulin. Answer to Question 1 How Could You Secure the Diagnosis? What Are the Differentials? A young male with a history of dog bite in a rabies-endemic country, presenting with fever and rapidly progressive ascending paresis a month later should elicit a high clinical suspicion of paralytic rabies. Laboratory confirmation must be done wherever feasible to rule out clinical mimics (Table 91.1) amenable to treatment and to institute prompt infection control measures. Testing at least three saliva samples at 3- to 6-hour intervals (owing to intermittent shedding of the virus in saliva), along with a nuchal skin biopsy for viral RNA by RT-PCR, can secure the diagnosis in most cases of the encephalitic form of rabies. Though serological diagnosis has a limited role in TABLE 91.1 Clinical Mimics of Rabies Syndrome or Disease Guillain Barré Syndrome Post-vaccination encephalomyelitis NMDAR antibody-mediated/Autoimmune encephalitis Campylobacter-associated summer paralysis syndrome Cerebral malaria Herpes simplex encephalitis Arthropod-borne encephalitides (e.g. Japanese encephalitis, West Nile Virus encephalitis, etc.) Poliomyelitis B-virus (Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1) encephalomyelitis Tetanus Snake- or Scorpion-envenomation Organophosphate poisoning Illicit drug use, CNS intoxicants Psychiatric disorders 253 254 CHAPTER 91 A 20-Year-Old Male from India With Fever and Quadriparesis the first week of illness, detection of rabies-specific anti-bodies in serum (of an unvaccinated individual) or CSF can aid in diagnosis, especially in cases where survival is prolonged beyond a week. If laboratory confirmation cannot be done ante-mortem, antigen detection by direct fluorescent antibody (dFA) test or RT-PCR on brain tissue obtained post-mortem can confirm or rule out a diagnosis of rabies (Table 91.2). Answer to Question 2 How Could Rabies Have Been Prevented in This Case? Prompt and appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after an exposure from a suspect rabid animal can prevent rabies in almost 100% of cases. True PEP failures are extremely rare and may occur because of short incubation periods resulting from multiple exposures on highly innervated areas of the body like the face, neck, hands etc. or because of direct inoculation of the virus into nerves. In severe exposures (WHO category III) PEP consists of thorough wound washing, active vaccination with anti-rabies vaccines and passive vaccination with anti-rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). While it may take about 5 to 7 days for vaccine-induced antibodies to be produced, RIG, which is locally infiltrated into and around the wounds neutralizes the virus deposited at the site of the bite and prevents its entry into the nerves. Even though the patient received adequate doses of active vaccine, he did not receive RIG, which is life-saving in individuals with severe exposures. Administration of human or equine RIG (or recently available monoclonal antibodies) could have possibly prevented rabies in this case. The Case Continued... After admission, the patient developed autonomic instability evidenced by increased perspiration and significant variability in heart rate and blood pressure. He developed dysphagia and respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation on the third day after hospitalization. His saliva sample collected at admission was positive for rabies viral RNA by RT-PCR; a CSF sample was negative. The patient died because of a sudden cardiac arrest on the fifth day of hospitalization (9 days post-onset of symptoms). SUMMARY BOX Rabies Rabies is a progressive, fatal encephalomyelitis caused by viruses of the Lyssavirus genus (Order Mononegavirales, Family Rhabdoviridae). Rabies lyssavirus (RABV), the prototype virus of the Lyssavirus genus, is the most common causative agent of rabies, usually transmitted through the bite of infected mammals, mostly dogs. About 61000 human global deaths occur because of rabies annually, mostly in Asia and Africa. The incubation period is usually 20 to 90 days, but may vary. Two distinct clinical forms of rabies are recognized: Encephalitic (\"furious\") and paralytic (\"dumb\"). The encephalitic form rarely poses diagnostic difficulties because of the classical clinical features like hydrophobia, aerophobia, agitation and TABLE 91.2 Tests for Laboratory Diagnosis of Rabies Sample(s) Test(s) Detection Sensitivity Remarks Ante-mortem Saliva RT-PCR Viral nucleic Moderate to high sensitivity Testing serial/pooled samples Diagnosis* acid recommended to increase sensitivity Nuchal skin RT-PCR Viral nucleic Moderate to high sensitivity Full thickness biopsy and adequate hair biopsy acid follicles required CSF, Urine RT-PCR Viral nucleic Low sensitivity acid CSF, Serum RFFIT, FAVN, Neutralizing Low sensitivity in first week of Presence of antibodies in CSF ELISA Antibodies illness; rises with increased (irrespective of prior vaccination status) (RFFIT, FAVN); duration of survival (>90% by and serum (in previously unvaccinated Antibodies 2 weeks) cases) diagnostic of rabies against viral glycoprotein (ELISA) Post-mortem Brain tissue dFA, RT-PCR Viral antigen High sensitivity (nearly 100%) Gold standard for laboratory Diagnosis** confirmation (dFA) RT-PCR: Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; RFFIT: Rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test; FAVN: Fluorescent antibody virus neutralization; dFA: Direct fluorescent antibody *A positive test confirms rabies; negative test results cannot rule out a diagnosis of rabies completely **A positive test on brain tissue confirms rabies; negative test rules out rabies CHAPTER 91 A 20-Year-Old Male from India With Fever and Quadriparesis 255 autonomic dysfunction; however, paralytic rabies may clinically mimic Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS), post-vaccination encephalomyelitis and other conditions (Table 91.1) posing a challenge in diagnosis and management. Fever at onset, paraesthesia in the bitten limb, rapid progression, quadriparesis with predominant involvement of proximal muscles, bowel and bladder involvement, percussion myoedema, presence of hydrophobia/aerophobia and CSF pleocytosis seen in paralytic rabies can help differentiate it from GBS. Post-vaccination complications historically observed with nerve tissue vaccines used in the past are rarely seen with the currently used rabies vaccines derived from tissue culture or embryonated eggs. High titres of neutralizing antibodies in CSF and serum and predominant involvement of grey matter in brain and spinal cord on neuroimaging in paralytic rabies can help distinguish it from post-vaccination neurological complications. Nerve conduction studies (an axonal neuropathy supports rabies), neuroimaging and laboratory tests (Table 91.2) can aid in the diagnosis. Currently, there is no specific antiviral therapy of proven efficacy for rabies. Management consists of symptomatic treatment and supportive care. Prognosis is dismal in both forms of rabies, resulting in death within one to 2 weeks of symptom onset. Survival from rabies is extremely rare, though critical care can reportedly prolong survival by a few weeks or months in some cases. This fatal disease can be prevented in most cases with appropriate PEP after exposure. Pre-exposure prophylaxis is recommended in individuals at high risk, including travellers to rabies-endemic countries. Further Reading 1. Warell MJ. Rabies. In: Farrar J, editor.

       " 'A 42-Year-Old Traveller Returning from Thailand With Fever and Thrombocytopenia\\nCAMILLA ROTHE, MARIA S. MACKROTH AND E. TANNICH\\nClinical Presentation\\nHistory\\nA 42-year-old German man presents to a hospital in Germany. For the past 6 days he has had a fever of up to 40°C (104°F), arthralgias and retro-orbital pain.\\nThe day before presentation, he returned from a 10-week trip to Thailand, where he had spent 2 months on Little Koh Chang, an island in the Andaman Sea. After that, he spent 5 days in Hua Hin at the Gulf of Thailand and another 5 days in Bangkok. He has not taken any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis, which is in line with the national recommendations in his home country for this trip.\\nHis past medical is unremarkable.\\nClinical Findings\\nOn examination, GCS is 15/15, Temperature 39.1°C (102.4°F), BP 156/80 mmHg, pulse 106 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breath cycles per minute, SpO2 95% on ambient air. There is no skin rash and no lymphadenopathy. Upon auscultation, his chest is clear. Abdominal examination does not show any intercostal tenderness, no tenderness on palpation and no organomegaly.\\nLaboratory results\\nFBC shows thrombocytopenia of 81 × 109/L (reference: 150–300) and is otherwise normal, CRP 55 mg/L (reference: <5), AST 62 U/L (reference: 10–50 U/L), ALT 106 U/L (reference: 10–50).\\nDengue NS1 antigen test is negative, the rapid diagnostic test for malaria (which detects Plasmodium falciparum- specific histidine-rich protein II and the panmalarial aldolase) is negative.\\nQuestions\\n1. What is your differential diagnosis?\\n2. How do you proceed?\\nDiscussion\\nA 42-year old German man presents with a fever for 6 days, retro-orbital pain and arthralgias after extensive travel in southern Thailand. He is febrile, but otherwise physical examination is unremarkable. Full blood count reveals thrombocytopenia, CRP and liver function tests are slightly elevated. Rapid diagnostic tests for dengue and malaria are negative.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat Is Your Differential Diagnosis?\\nGiven the clinical syndrome of fever, retro-orbital pain, arthralgias and thrombocytopenia after a visit to Thailand, the most likely differential diagnosis to suspect is dengue fever. Dengue is the most common febrile tropical disease seen in returning travellers from South and South-east Asia. The duration of fever, however, is borderline long for dengue. The dengue NS1 antigen test reflecting dengue viraemia may already be negative at day 6 and does not reliably rule out the infection. Chikungunya and Zika are additional important arboviral infections to suspect.\\nInfluenza is another important differential diagnosis to have in this patient. Fever and associated symptoms are usually of shorter duration but may last as long as 8 days. Acute HIV infection may present with persistent fever and thrombocytopenia, and possible exposures should definitely be inquired. Enteric fever presents with persistent febrile temperatures and otherwise non-specific symptoms. Because food hygiene in Thailand is overall very good, typhoid and paratyphoid fever are nowadays rarely seen imported from this country. Malaria has to be ruled out in any febrile traveller returning from a possibly endemic area, thrombocytopenia also being a hallmark feature. Malaria is nowadays rarely seen in travellers returning from Thailand; however, overlooking it could be lethal. A negative rapid diagnostic test (RDT) does not rule out malaria because RDTs are of unsatisfactory sensitivity for diagnosis of non-falciparum malaria. Also, in falciparum malaria high parasitaemia may cause a prozone phenomenon with a false negative RDT.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nHow Do You Proceed?\\nTo reliably rule out dengue and indeed any of the arboviral infections, serology at this point is the diagnostic test of choice, because viraemia is short and IgM should be positive by day 6 of fever. Convalescent samples taken 10 to 14 days later should show a further rise in titres.\\nFor diagnosis of influenza a deep nasopharyngeal swab should be obtained, and care must be taken to apply the correct technique. For acute HIV infection fourth-generation diagnostic tests which include p24 antigen, should be able to diagnose acute infection. Western Blot may still be negative at this stage, but in case of doubt, HIV PCR would help establish the diagnosis. Blood cultures would be the appropriate test to rule out enteric fever.\\nFor malaria, microscopy (thick and thin films) remains the diagnostic gold standard. Three negative films taken on consecutive days are considered to safely rule out malaria.\\nIf malaria parasites are detected but the species remains unclear even at a referral laboratory, species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be useful.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nA thick blood film showed Plasmodium species trophozoites at a density of 920/μL. On thin film however, the microscopist on duty was unable to determine the Plasmodium species. Based on the negative result of the rapid diagnostic test, non-falciparum malaria was suspected. The patient was admitted to the infectious diseases ward. Treatment was started with atovaquone/proguanil 250/100mg, 4 tablets once daily for 3 days. The patient rapidly recovered and was discharged on the fourth day. For further parasite differentiation, malaria microscopy was repeated by the head parasitologist. After intense reading of the Giemsa-stained thin blood film, 2 parasite-infected erythrocytes were identified with morphological characteristics compatible with Plasmodium malariae or P. knowlesi infection (Figs. 92.1 and 92.2).',\n",

Eight days prior, he developed fever and retro-orbital headache. Two days into the illness he was admitted to a local hospital in the jungle after he had developed jaundice, coffee-ground vomiting, gross haematuria and increasing mental obtundation. During the transfer to the referral hospital in Lima the patient had a generalized seizure. His past medical history included hepatitis of unknown aetiology 20 years before.\\nThe patient was born in Lima, but for the past 5 years has been working as a logging supervisor in a remote jungle area near Pucallpa on the shores of the Ucayali River (which joins the Marañón to form the Amazon river). He has not taken any malaria prophylaxis and has not received any vaccinations since his early childhood.\\nClinical Findings\\nTemperature 38.8°C (101.8°C), blood pressure 110/ 70 mmHg, heart rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. He is agitated, unresponsive to verbal commands and intermittently stuporous. There is marked flapping of hands, no focal neurological signs and no meningeal signs. He is jaundiced, and there is spontaneous bleeding of his oral mucosa and at venipuncture and IV sites. There are multiple large ecchymoses on the face, the trunk and all limbs (Fig. 93.1). On auscultation of the lungs there are crepitant rales in both bases. The heart sounds are normal. The liver is felt 3 cm below the right costal margin; the spleen is not palpable and there is no lymphadenopathy.\\nLaboratory Results\\nHis routine laboratory results on admission are shown in Table 93.1. His malaria thick film is three times negative. Blood cultures are negative. Brucella serology is negative.

What is your differential diagnosis?\\n2. What tests will you do to confirm the diagnosis?\\n• Fig. 93.1 Extended ecchymoses in a febrile Peruvian logger with fever and jaundice\\nDiscussion\\nA young male Peruvian logger working in the South American jungle presents with fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy and seizures. Laboratory results indicate liver failure.\\nAnswer to Question 1\\nWhat is your differential diagnosis?\\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure. Severe malaria is a possibility, although transaminases are usually not so high. The differential diagnosis includes viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, and E) and toxin-mediated hepatitis.\\nLeptospirosis seems possible, but the transaminases in leptospirosis are usually only mildly elevated (less than 200 U/L) and jaundice is caused by cholestasis rather than hepatocellular damage. Typhoid fever and brucellosis are other bacterial infections to be taken into account.\\nSevere dengue has to be considered, although 8 days of fever appears long for dengue and usually jaundice is not so prominent. Also, haematocrit would be increased rather than low, as in this case.\\nOther viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) with jaundice are possible, particularly given his occupation as a logger in the Peruvian jungle with possible contact to sylvatic mosquitoes and animals. The most prominent VHF in Peru is yellow fever and he does not appear to be vaccinated against this disease.\\nAnswer to Question 2\\nWhat Tests Will You Do to Confirm the Diagnosis?\\nSerial thick blood smears for malaria should be ordered.\\nDengue NS1 and dengue IgM should be performed (because NS1 might have turned negative after more than 1 week of illness).\\nBlood cultures should be done to look for Brucella species, as well as S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi. If brucellosis is suspected, microbiologists must be informed because specimens have to be handled under special biosafety precautions to prevent laboratory infections.\\nIf available, PCR of urine and blood should be done to look for leptospirosis; microscopic agglutination test is an alternative if PCR is not available.\\nLaboratory tests should include IgM antibodies for the different viral hepatitis viruses (except for acute hepatitis D because of delayed antibody production).\\nIgM antibodies against the yellow fever virus persist for several weeks and can be detected by various methods, e.g. IgM capture ELISA. Detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR could also be attempted.\\nThe Case Continued...\\nThe patient received presumptive treatment for malaria, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and supportive care. Over the next 3 days, he developed increasing hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, coma, and DIC with increasing spontaneous bleeding. The chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates compatible with ARDS (Fig. 93.2). Repeat laboratory results on day 3 showed deterioration of his kidney function (creatinine 6.5 mg/dL, urea 120 mg/dL) and a sudden drop in his liver transaminases (AST 100 U/L, ALT 200 U/L), most likely indicating acute hepatic disintegration. Sadly, the patient passed away 1 day later.\\nIgM capture ELISA for yellow fever came back highly positive at 1:10000. Anti-dengue IgM was negative. Direct viral isolation in culture was negative on a blood specimen drawn on admission (8 days into the illness), which is not surprising because viraemia in yellow fever is short (4–5 days). Permission for autopsy was refused, therefore liver histology was not available.\\n• Fig. 93.2 Chest x-ray of the patient showing bilateral patchy infiltrates.\\nYellow fever is and arboviral infection caused by a flavivirus and transmitted by Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes. It is endemic in South and Central America and in Africa. There is no yellow fever in Asia.\\nThe incubation period of yellow fever is usually 3 to 6 days. Most cases are subclinical or show mild and non-specific symptoms. After an acute febrile illness with headache and myalgia without a rash that likely represents the peak viraemia, there may be a period of remission, as seen in other flaviviral infections. Fever may then resume joined by back pain, nausea, vomiting and altered mental status progressing to the severe clinical syndrome described above. Haematemesis is commonly described. In fatal cases, death usually occurs 7 to 10 days into the illness.\\nYellow fever causes an infection of hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. There is mid-zonal hepatocellular necrosis with a minimal inflammatory response. Councilman bodies and microvesicular fatty changes are seen. The sudden and marked decrease of hepatic transaminases in our patient just before death likely represented near total destruction of functioning hepatocytes and acute hepatic disintegration.\\nAs with other flaviviruses there is no specific treatment for yellow fever, making prevention by use of the 17D live yellow fever vaccine imperative. Vaccine efficacy in immunocompetent persons is at nearly 100%. While most individuals in endemic areas (Amazon basin and sub-Saharan Africa) have poor access to vaccines and there are regular shortages during yellow fever epidemics there is dramatic under-use of the vaccination by travellers and expatriates. Data indicates that the number of unvaccinated travellers visiting risk areas is substantial. Each year, deaths in unvaccinated travellers to yellow fever endemic areas are reported.\\nFurther Reading\\n1. Blumberg L, Enria D, Bausch DG. Viral haemorrhagic fevers. In: Farrar J, editor.

Outside endemic areas, there was an outbreak of\\nmonkeypox in the United States in 2003 associated with infected\\nprairie dogs sold as pets.\\nAlthough considerably less infective than smallpox, monkey-\\npox can also spread from human to human through the respi-\\nratory route or by contact with an infected person's bodily fluids.\\nTransmission is believed to occur through saliva and respiratory\\nsecretions or contact with exudate or crust material from the skin\\nlesions. Risk factors for transmission include sharing a bed or\\nroom or using the same utensils as an infected person.\\nThe clinical picture of monkeypox is similar to smallpox but\\nshows a considerably milder course with a case fatality rate of\\n<10%.

Viscoli\\nInfectious Diseases Clinic, IRCCS, AOU San Martino-IST Hospital, Genoa, Italy\\nABSTRACT:\\nWe report the case of a 49-year-old homeless and alcoholic man, who presented with fever, cough and\\nfatigue and developed acute kidney and liver failure after admission. The patient was treated with ampicillin-sulbactam with complete recovery.\\nKeywords: Leptospirosis, Dialysis, Alcoholic.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nLeptospirosis is a widespread zoonosis. Natural reser-\\nvoirs are savage and domestic infected animals. Humans\\ndevelop the disease by indirect contact with urine-pol-\\nluted water and soil. Leptospirosis is a professional and\\nrecreational disease¹. In Italy, the burden of disease is\\nprobably underestimated and the incidence is higher in\\nthe North-East of the country³. Leptospirosis is usually a\\nsystemic febrile illness, characterized by lung involve-\\nment, jaundice, acute renal and liver failure, with hem-\\norrhagic diathesis, often requiring intensive care unit\\n(ICU) admission and renal replacement therapy4. Diag-\\nnosis is often difficult because only a limited number of\\nspecialized centers can perform specific serological and\\nmolecular tests.\\nCASE REPORT\\nA 49-year-old alcoholic and homeless man was admitted\\nto our Infectious Diseases Unit with a 7-day history of\\nfever, cough, weight loss and intense fatigue. Blood tests\\nshowed neutrophilic leukocytosis, hemolytic anemia and\\nthrombocytopenia, increased inflammatory markers (fib-\\nrinogen 8.20 mg/dl, PCR 244 mg/L), acute kidney failure\\nwith anuria (creatinine 3.6 mg/ml, estimated glomerular\\nfiltration rate 25 ml/min), jaundice (total bilirubin 10.3\\nmg/dl, direct bilirubin9.4mg/dl) and liver failure. Physi-\\ncal examination showed conjunctival injection, scleral\\nand skin jaundice and confusion. Chest x-ray was sug-\\ngestive for interstitial pneumonia [1]. Serological tests\\nfor HIV, HAV, HBV, HCV, TPHA, Widal-Wright, Weil-\\nFelix, CMV, EBV, toxoplasma were negative. Acid-fast\\nbacilli smear and culture and blood cultures were also\\nnegative. The patient developed a rapid deterioration of\\nrenal function (creatinine 7.6 mg/dl) with persistent\\nanuria, unresponsive to fluid administration and diuretic\\ntherapy with intravenous furosemide [4], as well as a de-\\ncrease of platelet count (33,000/µ1) and hepatic function\\n(total bilirubin 25 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 23.03 mg/dl).\\nHemodialysis was started. Considering the precarious\\nsanitary conditions, as well as the environmental and per-\\nsonal risk factors (alcoholism, crumbling housing), lep-\\ntospirosis was suspected. As a consequence, antibiotic\\ntherapy was switched to ampicillin-sulbactam and urine\\nand serum samples were sent to the National Reference\\nHospital INMI L. Spallanzani for Leptospira and Listeria\\ntests (positive serology >1:400 and urine polymerase\\nchain reaction for Leptospira, negative serology for Lis-\\nteria). In the following days, the patient progressively im-\\nproved, with normalization of blood tests. After two\\nweeks, the patient was finally discharged in good clinical\\nconditions.\\nCORRESPONDING AUTHOR: ANDREA PARISINI, MD; E-MAIL: ANDREA.PARISINI@FASTWEBNET.IT\\n1\\n2\\nINFECT DIS TROP MED\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThis case report underlines that leptospirosis is still a neg-\\nlected disease, which can affect people with some risk\\nfactors such as alcoholism, homelessness, poor hygiene.\\nLeptospirosis is still associated with high mortality and\\nmorbidity rate. Different antibiotic therapies have been\\nreported5,6, with the most consistent data referring to\\nampicillin. However, early diagnosis, renal replacement\\nand ICU support are crucial. Etiological diagnosis is\\noften difficult because of the limited number of special-\\nized centers available in Italy.

       " 'A 35-year-old Ecuadorian man presented in May 2010 with progressive headache followed by a single episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Contrast-enhanced brain computed tomography (CT) showed a single ring-enhancing lesion in the left frontal region. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of a cystic lesion with mass effect in the frontal left lobe and found two other smaller ring-enhancing lesions in the right post-central sulcus and in the left parietal sulcus. Considering the country of origin of the patient and the type of brain lesions, empirical treatment for neurocysticercosis with albendazole 400 mg bid was started in association with anti-epileptic and anti-edema therapy. After 28 days, treatment was discontinued and control MRI was performed. An increase in volume of the known lesions and the presence of two new ring-enhancing bilateral lesions were documented. Lumbar puncture was performed: cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) examination was normal, culture was negative, but CSF (1,3)-β-D-glucan (BG) was 282 pg/ml. Serum BG, cryptococcal antigen and galactomannan in CSF and serum, serum antibody assays for H. capsulatum and Coccidioides immitis were all negative. Stereotactic-guided craniotomy and total excision of the left frontal lesion was performed in June 2010. The biopsy specimens was culture-negative, Ziehl-Neelsen stain for Mycobacteria was negative, but Gomori-Grocott methenamine silver stain identified numerous yeast-like roundish structures of variable size and DNA of H. capsulatum was detected in tissue sample by real-time PCR. This patient was immunocompetent and serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative. He did not have any history suggestive of a deficient cellular immunity. His absolute lymphocyte count was normal. He denied involvement in any recreational activities that could have predisposed him to Histoplasma infection, or exposure to bat or bird droppings.',\n",

It is proven that these drugs increase\\nthe risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection\\n(LTBI). The risk is not the same for all drugs used; it\\nseems greater for infliximab (INX) and adalimumab\\n(ADA) than for etanercept. Nowadays it is universally\\naccepted the importance of screening and prophylaxis\\nfor LTBI. We present a case of tuberculous spondylo-\\ndiscitis in a man with Crohn's disease (CD) to under-\\nline the challenge that represents diagnosing this ill-\\nness especially for its sub-acute course and when there\\nis no evidence of active chest disease, which occurs in\\nmore than half of cases.\\nCASE REPORT\\nWe present a case of spondylodiscitis in a 46-year-old\\nman with CD. The clinical onset of CD was in 2008 with\\nno extraintestinal involvement. He started treatment\\nwith oral corticosteroids and azathioprine, discontinued\\nfor pancreatitis and replaced by methotrexate with only\\na partial response. In 2010, he was treated with mono-\\nclonal antibodies (first ADA and later INX) obtaining a\\npartial control. The last dose of ADA was given in Au-\\ngust 2010 and the last dose of INX in October 2011.\\nSubsequently, the treatment for his CD was based on\\nBudesonide 6 mg/day.\\nOn February 2014, at the moment of hospitaliza-\\ntion, he referred worsening back pain for the last four\\nmonths, without fever, weight loss or respiratory symp-\\ntoms. In 2010, before starting treatment with monoclo-\\nnal antibodies, his serology for HIV, HBV, HCV, HAV\\nand tuberculin skin test (TST) was negative and his chest\\nradiography was normal. Serology for Brucella spp.,\\nsyphilis and Q fever was negative as well as microscopy\\nand cultures of blood, urine and sputum samples.\\nMRI showed images compatible with spondylodis-\\ncitis involving T6-T10, affecting also soft tissues with\\nan area of necrosis (3x5x10 cm) and peripheral contrast\\nenhancement and an epidural component that shifts the\\nspinal cord but with no signal alteration. There was also\\na pathological fracture of T10 (Figures 1, 2).\\nINFECT DIS TROP MED\\nPedicle screws application of T1-T5, T11-L2 was\\nperformed through a medial posterior approach to the\\nspine and, through a left transforaminal approach, the\\nabscess was drained in a second surgical step. After two\\nmonths of induction, pyrazinamide and ethambutol were\\nsuspended and he followed treatment with isoniazid and\\nrifampicin until July 2015 (18 months of treatment).\\nThe follow-up, 20 months after the beginning of\\ntreatment, showed a clear clinical and radiological im-\\nprovement (Figure 3).\\nP\\nFigure 1.

A second MRI showed a re-\\nduction of the purulent collection but an increase of the\\nepidural component with medullar compression. From\\na neurological point of view there was no sensitive or\\nmotor deficit but hyperreflexia of the lower extremities.\\nDISCUSSION\\nTuberculous spondylitis (Pott's disease) most common-\\nly affects the lower thoracic and upper lumbar region¹,2.\\nThe most common symptom is a local pain, increasing\\nover weeks to months. The diagnosis is frequently de-\\nlayed as a result of its subacute course, especially in re-\\ngions where the incidence of tuberculosis is relatively\\nlow³,4. The greatest challenge is to consider the diagno-\\nsis, especially since there is no evidence of active chest\\ndisease in more than half of cases.\\nThe link between TNF-a inhibitors and increased risk\\nof tuberculosis is well documented.

It is thought that their in-\\nhibition is the biological basis for the increased incidence\\n(4 to 5 fold) of tuberculosis observed after initiation of\\nanti-TNF therapy with INX6 and other TNF-a inhibitors.\\nThe risk of serious infections in patients treated with\\nbiological drugs is not the same for all drugs used. Bon-\\ngartz et al reported that INX and ADA are associated\\nwith significantly increased risk compared with other\\nimmunomodulators and, according to Singh et al, the\\nrisk is significantly increased in methotrexate-experi-\\nenced patients. Particularly in patients affected by CD,\\nINX and ADA have been reported to cause cell death due\\nto apoptosis in lamina propria T cells, both in vitro and\\nin vivo. Even if most of the reactivations appear during\\ntreatment with TNF-a inhibitors or in the first year after,\\nit is proved that some events could appear lately10. In\\nhis observational study, Dixon found that 25 of 40 cases\\n(62%) were extrapulmonary, with a higher proportion of\\npatients treated with INF (67%) and ADA (65%)10.\\nGiven the risk of reactivation of LTBI in patients re-\\nceiving TNF-a inhibitors, it is crucial to screen all pa-\\ntients for LTBI prior to starting treatment. Our patient\\nhad a negative TST and a normal Rx chest exam before\\nstarting biological treatment. Hence, tuberculosis pro-\\nphylaxis was not necessary, even if there's some new\\nliterature evidence that strongly suggests the possibility\\nof reactivation of undetected LTBI11.\\nThe ex vivo interferon-y release assays (IGRAS)\\nmay overcome the limitations of the TST12. However,\\nit remains unclear whether or not they should be used\\nand how to implement them. This is reflected in dif-\\nferences in national guidelines13,14. It is also unclear if\\npatients who tested negative for LTBI before starting\\nanti-TNF therapy should undergo systematic reassess-\\nment. Despite being advocated¹5, there is no supporting\\nevidence for this practice. Anywhere the importance of\\nLTBI screening among patients with IBD is remarked\\nuntil considering it a quality indicator for Inflammatory\\nBowel Disease Comprehensive Care Units16.\\nIn our series, we have 1144 patients with a confirmed di-\\nagnosis of IBD, 297 with and 847 without biological treat-\\nment. A total of 74 (6.5%) patients had a positive screening\\ntest for tuberculosis, 33 (11.1%) among those with a bio-\\nlogical treatment and 41 (4.8%) in the other group. So that,\\n33 out of 297 (11.1%) of patients with biological treatment\\nreceived prophylaxis with isoniazid, and none had a reacti-\\nvation of the illness. However, in the group with biological\\ntreatment two patients that had a negative screening were\\nlater diagnosed of active tuberculosis.\\nCONFLICT OF INTERESTS:\\nThe Authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.\\nREFERENCES\\n1.

Acute presentation of disease is characterized by atyp-\\nical pneumonia, hepatitis, endocarditis/pericardial effusion\\nalong with arthralgia and myalgia¹. Diagnosis is based on\\nthe presence of typical clinical findings along with a spe-\\ncific serological response: an indirect immunofluorescence\\nIgM ratio of 1:50 with a 1:200 IgG ratio has been proposed\\nto be as high as 100% specific for acute Q fever².\\nHowever the presence of some clinical features of\\nacute Q fever (such as arthritis, rash, pleural and pericar-\\ndial effusion) side by side with the finding of positivity\\nfor antinuclear, anti-smooth muscle and antiphospholipid\\nantibodies³ may make very difficult the differential diag-\\nnosis with autoinflammatory and autoimmune disease es-\\npecially in low endemic areas.\\nCASE REPORT\\nA 52-year old woman was admitted to our hospital because\\nof mild pyrexia, fatigue, night sweets and polyarthralgia.\\nShe was of rural origin and she reported frequent close\\ncontacts with household animals. Her past medical history\\nwas uneventful apart from a four-year long lasting history\\nof Raynaud's phenomenon and arthralgia.\\nPhysical examination revealed diffusely decreased\\nbreath sounds at chest auscultation, soft hepatic enlarge-\\nment and bilateral arthritis of wrists and metacarpopha-\\nlangeal joints. Investigations showed mild anaemia, with\\nneutrophil leucocytosis and raised erythrocyte sedimen-\\ntation rate and C-reactive protein. Chest X-ray revealed\\nbilateral pulmonary infiltrates (Figure 1A) appearing as\\ndiffuse patchy ground-glass opacities at the chest HRCT\\n(Figure 1B). Routine and bronchioloalveolar lavage liq-\\nuid cultures were negative for common aerobic and\\nanaerobic bacteria, opportunistic and acid-fast bacilli.\\nDemonstration of a >4-fold rise of IgM type antibod-\\nies against phase II C. burnetii antigens prompted us to\\ndiagnose acute Q fever. Antimicrobial therapy with tetra-\\ncycline was then started. Routine echocardiography per-\\nformed to unmasking asymptomatic endocardial\\ninvolvement, unexpectedly revealed a significant peri-\\ncardial effusion.

After\\ntwo months of follow-up\\nthe patient developed a\\nnephrotic syndrome due to\\nmembranous glomerulo-\\nnephritis (C) and critical\\nlimb ischemia related to\\nsevere Raynaud phenom-\\nena (D) and livedo reticu-\\nlaris (E). Lupus band was\\nalso positive (F).\\nD\\nE\\nF\\n2\\nsuspected and a medium-dosage prednisone (10 mg/day)\\nwas added to antimicrobial therapy.\\nAt 2-weeks follow-up chest/pericardial disease and\\narthritis appeared to be dramatically improved and serol-\\nogy for C. burnetii markedly reduced. Patient was the\\ndischarged with the diagnosis of Q fever and suspected\\nSLE and a medium-dosage therapy with prednisone was\\nsuggested.\\nEarly after two months of follow-up the patient devel-\\noped critical limb ischemia related to severe Raynaud phe-\\nnomena (Figure 1D), livedo reticularis (Figure 1E) and\\nnephrotic syndrome due to membranous glomerulonephri-\\ntis (Figure 1C). Continuous treatment with endovenous\\nprostacycline analogue, and heavy immunosuppression\\nwith steroids and mycophenolate mophetil leads to im-\\nprovement of vascular and glomerular features.

Zaru², M.S. Mura¹'Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy2Unit of Gastroenterology, Santissima Annunziata Hospital, Sassari, ItalyABSTRACT:Background: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a complex illness with different clinical definition, etio-logical models and treatments. A lot of studies have focused on the concomitance with herpesviridae in-fections, especially Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). We report a clinical case highlighting the correlation betweenchronic EBV infection and CFS.Conclusions: Although some studies suggest that subjects with viral infections are not more likely to de-velop CFS than controls, the possible connection between EBV and CFS remains unclear. EBV-DNA showsthe presence of an actively replicating virus, which is known to be associated with several cancers. Whetherits replication is the cause or the consequence of CSF needs further investigations.Key words: Chronic fatigue syndrome, Epstein-Barr virus, EBV-DNA.INTRODUCTIONThe chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a controversialclinical condition, which predominantly affects youngadults, with a peak age of onset between 20 and 40 years,and it is most common in females than in males with aratio of 6:11,2.No pathognomonic signs or diagnostic tests for thiscondition are available, no specific treatment does existand CFS diagnosis can be made only by exclusion3,4. Ac-cording to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), physicians have to suspect this condition if theindividual has a severe chronic fatigue for 6 or more con-secutive months, interfering with daily activities, and thepatient has 4 or more of the following symptoms: unre-freshing sleep, muscle pain, headaches of a new type,polyarticular pain without swelling or redness, tender oflymph nodes in the neck or armpit, frequent or recurringsore throats. Actually, the etiology remains unknown anda lot of conditions and viral infections have been linkedto CFS, such as EBV infection.CFS is not synonymous of chronic EBV infection orchronic infectious mononucleosis, although they havebeen often associated.We report a clinical case of CFS with EBV chronicinfection in a 28 years-old girl from Sassari, in NorthwestSardinia.CASE REPORTThe patient was referred to the Infectious Disease Unitof the University of Sassari on April 2015 for the onsetof fatigue, headache, sleep disorders and muscle-skeletalpain associated to dyspeptic syndrome since 2007, rightafter hospitalization for EBV glandular fever.She had a medical history of PolyCystic Ovary Syn-drome (PCOS) and endometriosis treated with hormonaltherapy, a BMI of 25.5 kg/m² and she was not affectedby other health disorders.The cardiopulmonary physical examination was neg-ative, only abdominal tenderness on right quadrants waspresent.CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: VITO FIORE, MD; E-MAIL: VITOFIORE30010516@GMAIL.COM1INFECT DIS TROP MEDTable 1.

Tests for HIV, CMV and enteroviruseswere negative. EBV-DNA was highly positive (1937copies/ml), CMV-DNA was negative, excluding cross-reaction (Table 1).Clinical features, according to CDC indications, werecompatible with CFS.Thereupon, the patient started therapy with low-dosesteroids and multivitamins, with benefit.EBV-DNA has persisted slightly positive during thefollow-up until present day.9-22% six months after glandular fever, compared with0-6% in the second group¹¹.The presence of other factors such as a higher BMIand hormonal dysregulation during a chronic EBV infec-tion may probably favor the development of CFS12.EBV-DNA is a more sensitive test for the real pres-ence of an actively replicating virus and gives a more di-rect explanation of the EBV life-cycle. EBV replicationmay be the trigger or the consequence of CFS, likely re-lated to an immunological unbalanced situation.No easy conclusions can be drawn from a single casereport; we believe that further studies, conducted in alarger cohort of patients including EBV DNA measure-ment in blood, could better clarify if there is an associa-tion between persisting EBV viremia and CFS13.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS:The Authors declare that they have no conflict of inter-ests.2DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONAlthough CFS is a syndrome of unclear origin, many the-ories have been postulated but further studies are neededto finally elucidate the causative agent and mechanism.Several conditions, such as viral infections, allergies,nutritional deficiency, hormonal alterations or emotionalstress may contribute to its development; a common ele-ment seems to involve immune system. Particularly, EBVinfection. In fact, given its capability to create immumedisorders, it has been associated with many health disor-ders 6,7.Most studies on the link between mononucleosis andCSF are based on antibody titres, showing discordant re-sults. On one hand some studies sustain a correlations,whereas others deny the association arguing that hightitre of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to viral capsid antigen(VCA) of EBV in patients with CFS is an incidental find-ing and that there is not a difference of IgG-VCA titresbetween patients with CFS and healthy controls, thesame would apply to the EA titre¹º. No data are availableabout the use of IgM titres.Of importance, the White's London cohort, which fol-lowed up 250 primary care patients presenting glandularfever, 44% EBV-related and 34% non-EBV, or upper res-piratory tract infection, showed a prevalence of CFS ofREFERENCES1.

MondelloUOC of Infectious Diseases, G. Martino University Hospital, University of Messina, Messina, ItalyABSTRACT: The gastrointestinal tract is reported to be the sixth most common extrapulmonary site of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and chest X-ray shows concomitant lesions in 25-30% of cases.Any location from mouth to anus can be involved but, the ileocecal area is the most typical site of gas-trointestinal tuberculosis, while tuberculous peritonitis is relatively rare.We describe a case of gastrointestinal and peritoneal tuberculosis in a man coming from Ghana.Key words: Strongyloides stercoralis, Peritoneal tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis.INTRODUCTIONMycobacterium tuberculosis gastrointestinal involvementmay be either primary or secondary, from ingestion ofthe organism or from a pulmonary source. Tuberculousperitonitis occurs in less than 1% of cases1-10 and resultsfrom spread of adjacent tuberculous disease as an abdom-inal lymph node, intestinal focus, Fallopian tube or dur-ing miliary tuberculosis.Symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, weight loss arecommon; ascites usually result from peritoneal lymphaticobstruction and a lack of peritoneal fluid reabsorption,rarely from portal hypertension2.Acid fast smear of peritoneal fluid is rarely positive,the culture is positive in 25% of cases³; diagnostic la-paroscopy is usually necessary for definitive diagnosis.CASE REPORTA 31 year old man, originally from Ghana and residentin Calabria since three years, was admitted for a historyof 30 days of fever, weight loss (10 kg), dysuria, diar-rhoea. He was transferred from another hospital with thesuspicion of schistosomiasis.He was asthenic, with dehydrated pale mucous mem-branes and globular abdomen; on physical examination thepatient was febrile with normal pulse and blood pressure,cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable, ab-domen was distended and painful with mild hepatomegaly,inguinal adenopathy, painful hands and feet joints.WBC were 2500 mmc, 64% of neutrophils, 28% oflymphocytes, CD4+ T-cells were 42% and CD8 + T-cellswere 12%; Hb 11.8 g%; CRP 16 mg/dl; total protein 6.5g/dl with albumin 2.43 g/dl; renal and urine examinationwere normal as well as coagulation tests.The serology for HIV, HBV, HCV, Cytomegalovirus,VDRL and TPHA were negative.Antibodies and Schistosome eggs in faeces and urinewere negative.The stool examination showed numerous mobile lar-vae of Strongyloides stercoralis, as such, the patient wastreated with Albendazole 400 mg po bid for 8 days.Mantoux intradermal reaction and QuantiFERON-TBGold test were positive.Ultrasonographic examination revealed considerableascites, thickening loops and multiple mesenteric lymphnodes.A chest X-ray documented circumscribed parenchy-mal consolidation in the basal right lung, with a slightpleural effusion. A thoracic CT scan showed calcifiednodules in the left basal and in the left upper lobe. Directmicroscopy of acid-fast bacillus in the sputum was neg-ative.CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: ALESSIA PREZZAvento, MD; E-MAIL: LAPREZZA@GMAIL.COM12INFECT DIS TROP MEDParacentesis and analysis of ascitic fluid was performed:pH 8.5, 1200 white blood cells, albumin level of 27 g/L,serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) of 11 g/L; fluid cy-tology didn't reveal filariform larvae of S. stercoralis; Gramstain and Ziehl-Neelsen staining in the specimen were neg-ative; the cytology revealed typical mesothelial elementsand numerous leukocytes (mainly lymphocytes).The exploratory laparoscopy described a thickenedand hyperemic peritoneum with whitish or yellowishgranular nodules (5 mm) and peritoneal biopsy revealedchronic granulomatous infection with giant cells.The seventeenth day of hospitalization, antituberculosistreatment with four drugs was initiated, on the basis ofbody weight: rifampicin 450 mg po q24h, isoniazid 300mg po q24h, pyrazinamide 1000 mg po q24h and etham-butol 1000 mg po q24h, plus vitamin B6 300 mg po q24h.DISCUSSIONTuberculosis infection may involve any part of the gas-trointestinal tract from a primary ingestion of the organ-ism or secondary to other source.The peritoneal involvement is due to different mech-anisms: hematogenous spread of bacilli from a primarypulmonary site, swallowing sputum in the case of activelung disease, spread from secondary foci such as the peri-toneum, ruptured retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphnodes, from lesion in adjacent organs or by direct con-tamination4.There are three different clinical forms of peritonealtuberculosis: wet-ascitic, fibrotic-fixed, and dry-plasticform. The clinical differences among the three types arenot always distinct with the exception of the clinical pres-entation of abdominal distension, which is not present inthe dry-plastic form, the less common form³.The most common clinical features are fever and ab-dominal pain, weight loss is more common in secondarygastrointestinal tuberculosis. Only one third of patientshave diarrhea; although ulceration and mucous diarrheaare common with secondary form, hemorrhage and thepresence of blood in the stool are uncommon, maybe dueto the obliterative endarteritis.ATB is a diagnostic challenge, especially in the ab-sence of lung involvement; concomitant lesions at thechest X-ray are present in 25-30% of cases, the pleuraleffusion may be the only finding in the course of peri-toneal TB6.The characteristic colonoscopic appearances of TB areulceration and polypoid lesions7, these exams can help thediagnosis, mainly the differential diagnosis. The confirma-tion comes from the study of ascites fluid and biopsies.The peritoneal fluid is exudative, usually containing500 to 2000 cells, lymphocytes typically predominate,protein content higher than 30 g/L, SAAG < 11 g/L (lowspecificity); an increased adenosine deaminase level havehigh sensivity and specificity [8], cytological study mustalways be performer to look for neoplastic cells, the di-rect observation of acid-fast bacillus has a sensivity ofless than 10%, the evidence of granulomas with caseousnecrosis on histological examination of peritoneal biopsyand the isolation of M. tuberculosis in culture of asciticfluid or in biopsies confirm the diagnosis.The non-specific clinical presentation often results indiagnostic delay, with an average of 3 months; we madediagnosis and we started a specific treatment after 17days. We were initially searching for Strongyloides ster-coralis, an unusual cause of ascites, but we found My-cobacterium tuberculosis.CONFLICT OF INTERESTS:The Authors declare that they have no conflict of inter-ests.REFERENCES1.

NPC is rare among Caucasian people while it is common among peopleof Chinese or Middle Eastern ethnicity. Of the three histological types, the most globally diffused isthe type III or undifferentiated carcinoma. We present a case of NPC which occurred in an Italian Cau-casian man.Case presentation: A 40 years old man complained of a five month history of bilateral cervical lym-phadenopathies and severe weakness, treated with occasional corticosteroids and NSAIDs with mildand not sustained relief. Blood exams showed EBV-VCA IgG and EBV-DNA positivity. US and CT scandescribed \"hyperplastic or reactive lymph nodes” at both side of neck. Consequently, the patient un-derwent lymph node biopsy which described lymphatic methastasis of likely rhinopharyngeal origin.Nasal fibroscopy showed the presence of nasopharyngeal swelling which was confirmed to be a NPCat the histological exam. Finally, patient started treatment with cisplatinum and radiotherapy. Afterfive weeks, a nasal fibroscopy showed absence of neoplastic lesions and serum EBV-DNA was unde-tectables ix month later.Conclusions: Even if it is rare, NPC can occur among Caucasian men. EBV-DNA test is useful for diagnosis andpost-treatment follow-up.Key words: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Epstein-Barr virus, Caucasian, Italy, EBV-DNA, Lymph nodesBACKGROUNDEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is considered themost important risk factor for the development of na-sopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which is a malignantneoplasm diffused mostly in some geographical areas(mainly among Greenland natives, Middle-Eastern andEastern Asian people) but rare among Caucasian popu-lations in Europe as well as in Italy¹,2. Indeed, each yearin Italy less than fifty cases are notified³.Of the three different types of NPC recognized byWHO, the most globally diffused (around 95% of all di-agnosis) is the type III or undifferentiated non-keratinaz-ing cell carcinoma (type III)⁴.Herein, we report a case of NPC which occurred in aCaucasian Italian man.CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: ALESSIO STRAZZULLA, MD; E-MAIL: ALESSIOSTRAZZULLA@YAHOO.IT1INFECT DIS TROP MEDCASE REPORTIn November 2013, a 40 year old man was admitted tothe Unit of Infectious Diseases of \"Mater Domini\" Uni-versity Hospital of Catanzaro (Italy). He was of Cau-casian ethnicity and Italian nationality. During his life,he had always lived in Italy, moving abroad only for brieftravels (mostly in central Europe). He was a non smoker.He complained of a 5 month long history of severe weak-ness and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathies that hadbeen treated with corticosteroids and non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs with only mild and not sustained re-lief. Nothing worthy of attention was present at his fa-milial and medical history. At inspection, mildly painfuland fixed enlarged lymph nodes were present at bothsides of the neck. Hepatomegaly was also present (he-patic margin at 2 cm below the rib edge).Monotest resulted positive in August, negative in Sep-tember and positive again in October 2013. Once admit-ted at the hospital, laboratory tests revealed negative IgMversus the viral capsid antigen (EBV-VCA), Monotestand Paul-Bunnel reaction were also negative but EBV-VCA IgG and EBV-DNA were positive. Parotitis virusand Toxoplasma IgG were also positive. Leukocyte for-mula showed normal white cell counts (6,430 cell/µl),75% neutrophils and 16% lymphocytes. Other bloodexams were normal, except high creatinine (1.4 mg/dl)and low iron level (56 µg/dl).Patient underwent neck ultrasound which showed\"numerous hypoechogenic nodules\". On the left side, thebiggest had a diameter of 32 mm while on the right sidethe biggest had a diameter of 20 mm. These nodules hadto be referred to \"hyperplastic or reactive lymph nodes\".Enlarged lymph nodes were also confirmed by a CT scan(Figure 1).Following hematological consultation, a biopsy of alymph node was performed. Histologic/citologic exami-nation revealed the presence of “lymphatic metastasis ofundifferentiated cell carcinoma with Regaud growth pat-tern, likely nasopharyngeal neoplasm\". Once the diagnosis was obtained, patient wasreferred to an oncologic center. There, he was treated forsix weeks with radiotherapy, cisplatinum and corticos-teroids. At the end of treatment, lymphadenopathies wereresolved, fibroscopy did not show any nasopharyngeallesions and EBV-DNA was undetectable. Patient com-plained for weakness, nausea and mucositis. On July2014, EBV-DNA in serum was confirmed undetectable.DISCUSSIONIn non endemic regions, during last 50 years, incidenceof undifferentiated NPC raised1,5. However, this was sup-posed to be mostly related to the increase of migrationflows towards these areas from endemic regions ratherthan an augmented exposure of residents to risk factorsfor NPC development6. Indeed, in low incidence coun-tries, the risk of development of NPC in immigrants isestimated to be around 30-fold greater than in residents6.Unfortunately, there are not sufficient data on the epi-demiologic trend of NPC in Italy but we can argue thatepidemiology of NPC does not differ significantly com-pared to that of the rest of non endemic regions.In high incidence populations, exposure to risk factorsseems to be particularly important in early ages of life, lead-ing to incidence peak of 50-59 years and decline on subse-quent ages¹. On the other side, among low incidencepopulations, risk of NPC seems to increase with age¹.Among immigrants in non-endemic countries, risk of NPCseems to decrease with prolongation of residence7. In ourcase report, NPC developed at an earlier age than normallyexpected in either high or low incidence populations.Among risk factors that can act early in life, EBV in-fection could be important but, until now, association be-tween infectious mononucleosis, the most commonclinical manifestation of EBV infection and increased riskof NPC has not been statistically demonstrated and its im-portance in patient\\'s medical history could not be estab-lished4,8. However, it appears necessary to detect EBVrelated antibodies and DNA in blood. No sufficient dataare available about a possible utility of searching het-erophile antibodies, while in high risk population, researchof antibodies against VCA is now considered to bea screening test for NPC¹. Moreover, decreasing of VCA IgAand IgA against early antigen was associated with a remis-sion from NPC after treatment. EBV-DNA seems impor-tant not only for checking the presence of virus, but alsohigh levels of EBV-DNA are related with recurrence ofNPC either in high or low risk populations1,10.CONCLUSIONSIn Italy, as well as in the rest of Europe, NPC is a raremalignancy but it should be taken into account evenwhen classical risk factors are not present. It is possiblethat migration from high risk countries would further in-crease the incidence of this disease.Figure 1. Neck CT scan. The picture shows presence of bilateralcervical lymph nodes.

       " 'A 45-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of cervical pain and an epidural mass.\\nThere was a history of pulmonary tuberculosis 11 years earlier that was treated with isoniazid, pyridoxine, and rifampin for 18 months. Two years before admission the patient began to experience occasional cervical pain and \"stiffness.\" Twenty-one months before entry a left testicular mass was found. An ultrasonographic examination showed that the left testis and epididymis were enlarged and diffusely heterogeneous; the right testis appeared normal. A radical left orchiectomy was performed. Microscopical examination of the excised specimen revealed a seminoma confined to the testis; no evidence of lymphatic or blood-vessel invasion was seen. Tests on the serum for beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and for alphafetoprotein were negative. X-ray films of the chest disclosed linear scarring or subsegmental atelectasis in the lingula; partial volume loss was visible in the right upper lobe, with elevation of the minor fissure; a nodular opacity was projected over the anterior portion of the right first rib and was believed suggestive of an underlying nodule; the heart appeared normal, and no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy was seen. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax disclosed bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, with lymph nodes up to a diameter of 1.8 cm; multiple anterior mediastinal densities, 2 to 3 mm, surrounded by fat were believed to be consistent with fatty replacement of the thymus gland, which appeared more prominent than usual; no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy was seen; three nodules, 5 to 7 mm, were observed in the right lung, one in the right lower lobe and two in the right middle lobe; dependent atelectasis and linear scarring were evident at the lung bases; no abnormalities were detected in the visible portion of the liver. A CT scan of the abdomen, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed that the liver was homogeneous, without evidence of focal defects; the spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands appeared normal; no evidence of other soft-tissue masses or of free intraperitoneal fluid was found. A bipedal lymphangiographic examination disclosed enlarged, foamy inguinal, pelvic, and paraaortic lymph nodes without evidence of discrete filling defects; the appearance was believed to be consistent with a lymphoma or a reactive lymphoproliferative state. Microscopical examination of a percutaneous paraaortic lymph-node-biopsy specimen showed lymphoid hyperplasia without evidence of lymphoma. A test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies was positive; the patient denied homosexual activity or receipt of blood products but admitted the intravenous use of illicit drugs, a practice that he had abandoned nine years earlier. Radiation treatment was administered in a total dose of 3000 cGy to the left ilioinguinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes in 150-cGy fractions.\\nThereafter the patient was well until two or three months before entry, when the pain in his neck worsened, with radiation to the shoulders and arms; the pain was dull and constant and interfered with sleep; on one occasion he experienced difficulty in buttoning his trousers because of impaired motor function in the left hand, but this symptom did not recur. His pain was initially improved by the ingestion of acetaminophen, but more recently it required the addition of codeine and later the substitution of oxycodone-acetaminophen. One month before admission the patient became aware of increasing bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. Twenty-six days before entry x-ray films of the cervical spine, obtained at another hospital, showed an abnormality in the fourth cervical vertebra. A radionuclide bone scan revealed increased activity in the same location. Two weeks before admission the patient returned to this hospital, and physical examination confirmed the presence of cervical and axillary lymph nodes, 2 to 3 cm. Another x-ray film of the chest was unchanged. A repeated CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated several parailiac and inguinal lymph nodes, up to 12 mm, that were considered high-normal in size; an ill-defined, patchy density was observed at the base of the left lung. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the cervical spine (Fig. 1 and 2) disclosed a ventral epidural mass that extended from the first to the fifth cervical vertebra; diffuse, uniform enhancement of the mass was observed after the intravenous injection of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid; the mass had a bilobed configuration, flattened the ventrolateral aspect of the spinal cord at the C4 level, and extended into the foraminal regions at the C3-4 and C4-5 levels; abnormally low signal intensity was observed in the C4 vertebral body on the T₁-weighted images; the T2-weighted sequences showed an increased signal in the C4 vertebral body, without evidence of disk-space involvement. The epidural lesion was not considered to be easily amenable to a biopsy procedure. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\\nThe patient worked as a counselor. His wife and children were well. He had abused alcohol as well as intravenously administered drugs in past years but had discontinued both practices. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. Adult cats and a goldfish were present in his home. There was no history of muscular weakness, gait disturbance, bladder incontinence, impotence, headache, visual disturbance, chest pain, dyspnea, edema, wheezing, jaundice, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, change in mental status, cough, hemoptysis, abdominal pain, or opportunistic infections, and he had never received zidovudine. He used no medications other than oxycodone-acetaminophen as needed for pain.\\nThe temperature was 36.2°C, the pulse was 80, and the respirations were 16. The blood pressure was 135/85 mm Hg.\\nOn physical examination the patient appeared well and adequately nourished. No rash or cutaneous lesions were seen; scars of needle tracks were observed in both antecubital fossae. Prominent, mildly tender cervical and axillary lymph nodes, 2 to 3 cm, were noted. The head was normal; no exudate was observed in the mouth or throat. The neck was supple; no tenderness was found over the cervical spine or paraspinal region. The lungs were clear, and the heart was normal. Abdominal examination was negative. There was no peripheral edema. The genitalia were normal except for surgical absence of the left testis. Rectal examination disclosed a normal sphincter tone; the prostate gland was small, firm, and nontender, and a stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. Neurologic examination showed that the patient was alert, oriented, and fluent; the cranial-nerve functions were preserved; strength was graded 5/5 throughout, and sensation was intact; coordination was normal; the deep tendon reflexes were + and equal bilaterally, and the plantar responses were flexor.\\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 34.4 percent; the white-cell count was 4300, with 49 percent neutrophils, 29 percent lymphocytes, 8 percent monocytes, 10 percent eosinophils, and 4 percent basophils. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 83 µm³ per cell, the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 28.3 pg per red cell, and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 34 percent. The platelet count was 230,000. The prothrombin time was 10.0 seconds, with a control of 10.8 seconds; the partial thromboplastin time was 30.9 seconds. The bleeding time was three minutes. The urea nitrogen was 3.9 mmol per liter (11 mg per 100 ml), the creatinine 90 µmol per liter (1.0 mg per 100 ml), and the glucose 7.11 mmol per liter (128 mg per 100 ml). The sodium was 143 mmol, the potassium 3.6 mmol, the chloride 106 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 29 mmol per liter. The amylase was 109 U per liter. An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 80 and was within normal limits. Another x-ray film of the chest was unchanged.\\nAcetaminophen and oxycodone-acetaminophen were administered as needed for pain. On the third hospital day the temperature rose to 37.4°C, and it was normal on all other occasions. A right cervical lymph-node biopsy was performed. Microscopical examination of the excised specimen revealed lymphoepithelial cysts with epimyoepithelial islands and florid reactive hyperplasia. Microscopical examination of immunoperoxidase stains disclosed that T suppressor cells (CD8+) greatly outnumbered T helper cells (CD4+); the findings were believed consistent with the lymphoepithelial cyst that has been described in association with HIV infection. Microscopical examination of stained specimens of the lymph node showed no acid-fast bacilli; culture of the specimen yielded propionibacterium species in a thioglycolatebroth tube only and was otherwise sterile; a mycobacterial culture was pending. On the eighth hospital day a CT-guided biopsy of the fourth cervical vertebral body was performed. Microscopical examination of stained specimens of the biopsy material again revealed no acid-fast bacilli, and a culture yielded no microorganisms. Histopathological and cytologic examinations gave no definitive diagnosis.\\nOn the ninth hospital day physical examination showed mild neck stiffness but no neurologic change. The hematocrit ranged between 32.7 and 36.4 percent, and the white-cell count ranged between 4200 and 4800; another differential count revealed 31 percent neutrophils, 2 percent band forms, 46 percent lymphocytes, 7 percent monocytes, 12 percent eosinophils, and 2 percent basophils. The urea nitrogen was 5.7 mmol per liter (16 mg per 100 ml), and the glucose 5.61 mmol per liter (101 mg per 100 ml). The sodium was 135 mmol, the potassium 4.3 mmol, the chloride 101 mmol, and the carbon dioxide 27.3 mmol per liter. A repeated MRI scan of the cervical spine and another x-ray film of the chest were unchanged. A test on the blood for cryptococcal antigen was negative.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. NORMAN L. LETVIN: This 45-year-old man had a history of treated pulmonary tuberculosis, a treated early-stage seminoma, and intravenous drug use. He was HIV-seropositive. Diffuse lymphadenopathy developed and progressed over two years. He also had a history of neck pain and stiffness for two years that worsened for two or three months before admission. Evaluation of his neck discomfort revealed diffuse bone loss localized to the fourth cervical vertebra and a contiguous epidural mass extending from the first to the fifth cervical vertebra. A cervical lymph-node biopsy and a CT-guided biopsy of the body of the fourth cervical vertebra did not yield a diagnosis.\\nMay we begin by reviewing the radiographic studies?\\nDR. JANET H. TABAS: The plain x-ray films of the chest obtained at this hospital do not suggest any pulmonary nodules. A plain film of the cervical spine obtained at another institution demonstrates diffusely decreased density of the C4 vertebral body. The nuclear-medicine study, also obtained at another institution, shows increased tracer uptake at the C4 level. The sagittal T₁-weighted MRI scan through the cervical spine (Fig. 1) demonstrates a ventral epidural mass located predominantly at the C4 level, with soft tissue anteriorly. There is a subtle decreased signal involving the body of C4, but the end plates are well marginated and appear intact. Films taken after the injection of gadolinium show uniform enhancement of this mass, which extends from CI to C5. There is also enhancement of the soft tissue anterior to the vertebra, with some disruption of the cortical margin of the C4 vertebra both posteriorly and anteriorly. The T₁-weighted axial image through this level demonstrates the mass, which is bilobed and extends through both neural foramina and also anterior to the vertebral body. In addition, there is compression of the left anterolateral portion of the spinal cord by the mass. The T2-weighted image through the same level (Fig. 2) again demonstrates the bilobed mass. In addition, there is abnormal increased signal intensity involving the body of C4.\\nDR. LETVIN: The differential diagnosis of a vertebral lesion with a contiguous epidural mass must include both infectious processes and tumors. Because of its potential to progress precipitously and cause irreversible neurologic damage a bacterial epidural abscess should have been considered early in the evaluation of this patient. Intravenous drug use predisposes to seeding of bacteria into a vertebra or the epidural space. In reports of a number of series of cases of confirmed bacterial epidural abscesses an underlying bacterial cause was often not suspected at the time of the patients\\' initial presentation. Surprising-ly enough, patients with bacterial abscesses can come to medical attention with symptoms that have progressed slowly over a period of months and without a fever or leukocytosis. Evaluation of cases in which that diagnosis is suspected should include radiographs of the spine, spinal puncture with cultures, and blood cultures. An increased protein concentration or a pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid, or both, is almost always seen in this clinical setting. The authors of a recent large series, however, reported that only 6 to 28 percent of cultures of the cerebrospinal fluid yielded the causative organism. Although these diagnostic studies are not reported in the case under discussion, a number of findings are against a bacterial process. The patient had symptoms for a number of months without evidence of a systemic illness or progressive neurologic deterioration. The radiographic studies of the cervical spine did not suggest a bacterial infection, since there was no evidence of involvement of a disk space or adjacent vertebras. Finally, the vertebral-body biopsy did not yield an organism.\\nThe description in this patient of poorly defined pulmonary lesions that appear to have resolved over the two years leading to admission to this hospital suggests consideration of a number of mycotic infections. An extending aspergilloma has been reported as a rare cause of an epidural abscess with vertebral destruction. In immunocompetent patients the abscess is due to local extension from a focus of infection in the apex of the lung. Although abnormalities demonstrated on x-ray studies of the chest were reported during the course of this patient\\'s illness, no upper-lobe lesions were described. Cryptococcus causes a primary pulmonary infection and can occasionally spread to bone. The absence of meningitis and the negative serologic test for cryptococcal antigen are against this fungus as a pathogenic agent in this patient. North American blastomycosis commonly causes an osteomyelitis with extension to form contiguous abscesses. Coincident pulmonary involvement might also be expected in this systemic fungal disease. However, patients with this disorder are predominantly from the southern, southeastern, and midwestern regions of the United States. Finally, coccidioidomycosis can also cause coincident pulmonary and bone disease. However, like patients with blastomycosis, North Americans with coccidioidomycosis come from a restricted geographic region in the southwestern United States and Mexico. We have no information concerning this patient\\'s place of residence. If this HIV-infected man had recently progressed from a state of relative immunologic normalcy to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a fungal infection of this type might be expected. The preservation of the intervertebral-disk space in this patient, however, is against any of these infectious processes as underlying his pathologic condition.\\nThe diagnosis of cat scratch disease must also be considered in this cat owner with diffuse lymphadenopathy of uncertain cause. Although the cat scratch disease bacillus usually induces a benign, self-limited disease characterized by regional lymph-node involvement, it can occasionally cause diffuse lymphadenopathy and even vertebral osteomyelitis. The involved lymph nodes in this disease have a characteristic histologic appearance, with follicular hyperplasia and discrete granulomas that usually become suppurative. It is of interest that in a recent report of systemic cat scratch disease in a patient with AIDS lymph nodes were characterized on histologic examination by clusters of vacuolated granular macrophages admixed with pyknotic nuclear debris rather than suppurative granulomas. The histologic examination of the lymph nodes in the patient under discussion showed no evidence of a granulomatous process. Moreover, all the patients with systemic cat scratch disease in the reported cases have had constitutional symptoms, which were absent in this patient. Thus, there is strong evidence to suggest that he did not have systemic cat scratch disease. An infection by the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, commonly transmitted from cats to human beings, may also induce lymphadenopathy in immunocompetent or immunocompromised persons. However, the histologic appearance of the lymph nodes in this case and the absence of systemic symptoms, ocular involvement, or evidence of encephalitis are against that diagnosis.\\nAlthough the patient\\'s clinical presentation would be very unusual as a manifestation of any of these infectious processes, the diagnosis of tuberculosis must be given serious consideration. If he was indeed presenting for the first time with evidence of frank AIDS, one must be concerned about either a new infection with an atypical mycobacterium or a reactivation of his previously treated Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Clinically apparent infections with M. avium-intracellulare are usually late opportunistic infections in HIV-infected persons. Although such infections can cause pulmonary infiltrates and lymphadenopathy, they usually result in fever, diarrhea, and progressive weight loss. An extremely high density of these bacteria is seen in infected cells. This patient\\'s clinical presentation and the absence of acid-fast bacilli in the lymph-node-biopsy and vertebral-biopsy specimens are against infection by an atypical mycobacterium.\\nLate in the course of AIDS, tuberculosis often assumes atypical features, with a high frequency of extrapulmonary sites of infection. When infection by M. tuberculosis is seen as the first opportunistic infection in an HIV-infected person its clinical characteristics are indistinguishable from those of M. tuberculosis infections in HIV-seronegative patients. Vertebral infection by M. tuberculosis, Pott\\'s disease, could account for this patient\\'s clinical picture. Tuberculosis involves vertebras in only approximately 1 percent of all the cases, and it involves the cervical spine in less than 5 percent of these cases. As classically described, spinal tuberculosis begins in the anterior inferior portion of the vertebral body and spreads beneath the anterior longitudinal ligament to involve adjacent vertebral bodies. Disk-space narrowing then occurs secondarily when destruction of bone permits herniation of the disk into the affected vertebral body. Thus, as classically described, this syndrome is characterized by involvement of adjacent vertebral bodies, with destruction of the intervening disk. However, Rahman et al. have reported a series of nine cases of spinal tuberculosis involving a single vertebra, with sparing of intervertebral disks. Contiguous masses apparently out of proportion in size to the amount of bone destruction are seen in 55 to 96 percent of cases of vertebral M. tuberculosis infections. Smith et al. have described a small series of patients with Pott\\'s disease whose preoperative MRI diagnosis was tumor. Although a paucity of acid-fast bacilli is usually seen at the site of such an infection, Silverman et al. have recently reported the successful cytologic diagnosis of this syndrome from material obtained by fine-needle aspiration with the finding of Langhans\\' giant cells. The nondiagnostic cytologic evaluation of the vertebral-body specimens in this case, the adequate treatment of the patient for tuberculosis in the past, and the absence of intervertebral-disk involvement are against the diagnosis of Pott\\'s disease but do not exclude it.\\nThe diagnosis of Pott\\'s disease cannot, however, explain the patient\\'s two-year history of increasing diffuse lymphadenopathy. Diffuse lymphadenopathy can be seen in the setting of a variety of infections, including tuberculosis. However, when lymphadenopathy occurs as a manifestation of an infection, constitutional symptoms usually are also present. Diffuse lymphadenopathy in the absence of a fever should also make one consider the diagnosis of a tumor, particularly a lymphoma. Such a diagnostic possibility must be given even greater credence in an HIV-infected person. However, the histologic findings in the lymph nodes obtained by biopsy in this patient were typical of those described in the HIV-induced persistent generalized lymphadenopathy syndrome. A florid follicular hyperplasia can be seen in reactive lymph nodes of various causes. In hyperplastic lymph nodes that do not occur as a consequence of HIV infection CD4+ (helper/inducer) T lymphocytes usually outnumber CD8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) T lymphocytes by a 2:1 ratio in the T-lymphocyte-rich interfollicular areas. In HIV-induced hyperplastic lymph nodes interfollicular CD8+ lymphocytes outnumber CD4+ lymphocytes. These changes in T-lymphocyte subsets in the lymph nodes parallel those seen in the peripheral blood of individual patients. Such a CD8+ lymphocyte predominance was seen in the biopsy specimen of the cervical lymph node of this patient.\\nIt is of interest that examination of this biopsy specimen also demonstrated lymphoepithelial cysts with epimyoepithelial islands. Smith et al. have recently reported a series of 15 partial parotid-gland and salivary-gland resections in intravenous drug users who presumably were HIV-seropositive. On microscopical examination these authors found lymphoid tissue containing embedded ductal epithelial structures, microcysts, and epimyoepithelial islands. They suggested that these changes resulted from HIV infection of intraglandular lymph nodes that were originally incompletely encapsulated and contained epithelial inclusions. The cervical lymph node in this patient almost certainly represented an example of this syndrome of benign lymphoepithelial lesions of the parotid gland.\\nHaving attributed the patient\\'s diffuse lymphadenopathy to the HIV-induced syndrome of persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, I must explain only his C4 vertebral lesion and epidural mass. Although these pathologic processes can be explained by one of the infectious diseases already described, they could also have been induced by a tumor. Since the patient was infected with HIV and had HIV-induced lymphadenopathy, the tumors to be considered must be those that arise in the setting of AIDS. In a series of 200 HIV-infected patients 14.5 percent were demonstrated to have neoplastic disease. Epidemiologic data firmly link Kaposi\\'s sarcoma and high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas to HIV infection. Other malignant tumors, including Hodgkin\\'s disease, multiple myeloma, anorectal carcinoma, and squamouscell carcinomas of the head, neck, and oral cavity, have been reported in HIV-infected persons, although there is no good epidemiologic evidence to establish these diseases as part of the spectrum of AIDS. Although Kaposi\\'s sarcoma can occasionally present initially as a visceral tumor in patients with AIDS, the mucocutaneous lesions of Kaposi\\'s sarcoma invariably develop during the course of their disease. Thus, it is improbable that this patient had Kaposi\\'s sarcoma. His peripheral lymphadenopathy does not appear to have resulted from a lymphoma, but the C4 cervical lesion and the epidural mass could certainly have been the initial presentation of a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Snider et al. reported the case of a patient with AIDS whose first manifestation of an immunoblastic sarcoma was an epidural lesion with cord compression. However, a new pathologic process such as that one need not be implicated to explain the clinical status of the patient under discussion.\\nAn interesting possible tumor that should be considered in this case is a metastatic seminoma. The patient was treated for an assumed Stage I testicular seminoma with orchiectomy and ipsilateral inguinal and retroperitoneal irradiation 21 months before the recent hospital admission. This approach to treatment is curative in 94 percent of the patients. He had a thorough staging evaluation for this tumor, which included a lymphangiographic study, an abdominal CT scan, and a percutaneous paraaortic lymph-node biopsy. These studies demonstrated lymphadenopathy, presumably related to his HIV infection, but no metastatic seminoma.\\nThe absence of lymphatic or vascular invasion by a germ-cell tumor as described in this case is in general a good prognostic sign, suggesting a low likelihood of metastasis. However, it is interesting to speculate that the patient\\'s disease might actually have been more advanced at the time of the initial diagnosis than was assumed. Lymph nodes containing foci of tumor might have been masked by his HIV-induced persistent generalized lymphadenopathy. If that indeed occurred, the patient might have been undertreated, increasing the likelihood of an eventual recurrence of the seminoma. However, even in patients with properly treated Stage I disease recurrences can occur, usually within two years of the initial treatment.\\nSeminomas usually metastasize in an orderly fashion, spreading unilaterally to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes and then to the mediastinal lymph nodes. Hematogenous spread of tumor can, however, also occur. Although bone metastases of seminoma have been assumed to be rare, in a series of 154 cases of germ-cell tumors with study at autopsy there was bone involvement in 56 percent of the patients with seminomas. Clearly, an isolated metastatic focus of seminoma involving a single cervical vertebra and a contiguous epidural mass would be very unusual. Nevertheless, of the two cases of treatment failure in Stage I seminoma from 1970 through 1979 reported by Huben et al., one involved an isolated clavicular lesion. Among 20 cases of treatment failure in seminoma reported by Friedman et al., the failure presented as an odontoid erosion in 1 case. Perhaps most to the point, in a series of first relapses of Stage I, II, or III seminomas Calman et al. reported cases of both isolated cervical vertebral disease and isolated cervical extradural disease. Thus, the presentation of metastatic seminoma as an isolated cervical focus with epidural extension is not without precedent.\\nDid this patient\\'s HIV seropositivity place him at an increased risk for the development of a seminoma or metastasis from that primary tumor? The type of overwhelming epidemiologic evidence implicating a relation between HIV infection and non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Kaposi\\'s sarcoma does not exist for seminomas. Epidemiologic correlations between the frequency of testicular germ-cell tumors and HIV seropositivity are complicated by the occurrence of both in the United States, predominantly in young to middleaged men. However, recent reports of case cohorts suggest that testicular germ-cell tumors may occur with a disproportionate frequency in HIV-infected men. The metastatic pattern and responsiveness to treatment of these tumors in HIV-seropositive men do not appear to be atypical.\\nIt is interesting to speculate about why HIV infection might predispose a person to the development of a testicular germ-cell tumor but not a variety of other tumors. There is a suspicion that both the non-Hodgkin lymphomas and the Kaposi\\'s sarcomas that occur in the setting of AIDS may be caused by infectious agents. A breakdown in the immune system of the HIV-infected person, perhaps a breakdown in the T lymphocyte\\'s ability to contain these infectious agents, may be responsible for the development of these tumors. If HIV-induced immunodeficiency is eventually shown to predispose patients to the development of germ-cell tumors, it might provide evidence that germ-cell tumors may also have an infectious cause.\\nAlthough Pott\\'s disease must be considered seriously in this case and a newly presenting non-Hodgkin lymphoma cannot be ruled out, I think that the most likely diagnosis is metastatic seminoma. To make this diagnosis I would have asked the surgeon to perform an open biopsy of the fourth cervical vertebra. If that biopsy was not revealing I would have asked the surgeon to go through the interspace to obtain a biopsy specimen of the epidural mass.\\nDR. ROBERT E. SCULLY: May we have the medical students\\' diagnoses, Dr. Huang?\\nDR. PAUL L. HUANG: The medical students considered several major categories in the differential diagnosis of the cervical mass in this patient. The first was a malignant tumor, such as a lymphoma or recurrent germ-cell tumor. The second was an infectious process, including tuberculosis, with Pott\\'s disease and a cold abscess, infection due to atypical mycobacteria, and toxoplasmosis. Thirdly, they considered other possibilities, such as eosinophilic granuloma. The students believed that the clinical course and radiographic features were most consistent with a lymphoma. They suggested that the diagnostic procedure was either an open biopsy or immunohistochemical staining of the cervical-biopsy specimen.\\nDR. SCULLY: Dr. Harmon, you saw this patient. Will you tell us your impressions?\\nDR. DAVID C. HARMON: I put the first three possibilities as lymphoma, seminoma, and tuberculosis until examination of the lymph-node-biopsy specimen was reported as negative. Because the patient did not seem systemically ill we did not pursue the possibility of a bacterial cause, although I think that it deserves to be in the differential diagnosis. The history that the patient had given to me was of a more subacute neck stiffness, over a couple of months rather than a couple of years. I thought that it was possible that the testicular tumor had been under-staged because of the patient\\'s wishes to limit the staging studies then. When the lymph-node biopsy failed to show lymphoma, metastatic seminoma became more likely.\\nDR. ROBERT L. Martuza: I thought that the findings were most consistent with tumor, and in view of the history of a recent seminoma, metastatic tumor was my first diagnosis. However, because of the unusual radiologic appearance of the epidural lesion a lymphoma was also considered a possibility.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nMetastatic tumor, probably seminoma; ? lymphoma or tuberculosis.\\nDR. NORMAN L. LETVIN\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nMetastatic testicular seminoma.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. SCULLY: Dr. Harris, will you discuss the lymphnode findings?\\nDR. NANCY L. HARRIS: Examination of the biopsy specimen of the cervical lymph node described in the case record (Fig. 3) showed an enlarged lymph node with prominent follicular hyperplasia and several cystically dilated spaces filled with fluid. The follicles contained an admixture of cleaved and noncleaved follicular-center cells with a prominent starry-sky pattern and a poorly formed mantle zone, characteristic of the very floridly reactive follicles seen in patients with lymphadenopathy associated with HIV infection. The interfollicular region contained a polymorphous mixture of small lymphocytes, reactive immunoblasts, and plasma cells, without diagnostic histologic features of lymphoma. The cysts consisted of salivary-duct epithelial cells infiltrated by lymphocytes; other epithelial structures were present throughout the lymph node, many of which were also infiltrated by lymphocytes (Fig. 4). Inclusions of salivary-gland epithelium are commonly found within intraparotid lymph nodes in normal persons. In this case examination of the epithelial structures showed infiltration by lymphoid cells, many of which were slightly larger than normal lymphocytes, with indented nuclei and more abundant pale-staining cytoplasm; these cells have been called centrocyte-like cells or monocytoid B cells and are characteristic of the so-called lymphoepithelial lesion that is seen in patients with Sjögren\\'s syndrome.\\nThe case was studied in frozen section with immunoperoxidase stains. There was no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell population. Both the follicles and the interfollicular region clearly showed polytypic staining for immunoglobulin. On sections stained with an antibody to the CD4 antigen there were only rare positive cells within reactive germinal centers in the interfollicular region. On an adjacent section stained with the CD8 antibody the majority of the lymphocytes in the interfollicular region were positive.\\nThis is an example of the so-called lymphoepithelial cyst or benign lymphoepithelial lesion that can be seen in intraparotid or paraparotid lymph nodes in patients with HIV infection. In the cases reported in the literature there has been no association with B-cell lymphoma, either in the affected lymph nodes or in the parotid gland. The lesion is not specific for HIV infection, since it is commonly seen in patients with Sjögren\\'s syndrome and also in some patients without Sjögren\\'s syndrome. Only one example of this lesion in an HIV-positive patient with immunologic-marker studies has been reported in the literature to my knowledge. In that case there was a slight excess of CD8+ over CD4+ cells, in contrast to this case, in which there was a marked predominance of CD8+ cells.\\nDR. MARTUZA: The operation was a left C4 hemilaminectomy. A posterior approach was chosen for two reasons. The first is that the patient had a fresh scar in the right anterior portion of the neck and a recent needle-biopsy tract on the left side. Their presence could have increased the risk of infection in an anterior surgical site. Secondly, the biopsy of epidural tissue could be performed from behind. At the operation the bone was softer than usual, and the lateral epidural space contained abnormal light-gray tissue. This tissue formed an infiltrating plaque in the epidural space that did not distort the spinal cord. No purulent material was seen.\\nDR. SCULLY: I shall call on Dr. Vonsattel to tell us about the diagnostic procedure and the results.\\nDR. JEAN-PAUL VONSATTEL: We received for pathological examination five fragments of tan tissue and chips of bone, altogether about 2 cm in greatest dimension. The non-bony specimen consisted of dense connective tissue with loosely trabeculated areas. The tissue was infiltrated with lymphocytes and scattered large tumor cells, 15 to 25 µm in diameter (Fig. 5). The tumor cells were polyhedral or oval, with discrete cell borders, slightly granular cytoplasm, and a large, centrally located nucleus with focal flattening of its contours. The nucleoli in the tumor-cell nuclei were ill-defined, as were the PAS-positive intracytoplasmic granules, probably because the tissue preservation was not optimal. Immunoperoxidase studies performed on paraffin-embedded sections showed faint staining of a few large tumor cells for placenta-like alkaline phosphatase. Their staining was negative for lymphoid markers such as LCA, UCHL-1, and 1-26. Special stains for acid-fast organisms and fungi were negative, as were immunoperoxidase studies for herpes simplex Type 1 and Type 2 viruses and cytomegalovirus. Focally, the tumor was present in the marrow of the lamellar bone available for examination.\\nNow I shall compare the C4 tumor with the tumor that apparently was confined to the left testis, which was removed 21 months previously. The left testis was enlarged. The parenchyma was almost entirely replaced by a lobulated pale-pink, nonencapsulated, focally necrotic mass that was sharply demarcated from a thin rim of surrounding testicular tissue. The testicular tumor was composed of aggregates and cords of large, uniform cells bordered by connective tissue and a lymphocytic infiltrate, typical of a seminoma (Fig. 6). Examination of the areas of the testicular tumor with a large amount of stroma showed striking histologic similarities to the C4 mass.\\nIn the case under discussion both the primary testicular tumor and the C4 mass were composed of pure seminoma. No other germ-cell element or syncytiotrophoblast giant cells were found. Autopsy studies have shown that when seminoma metastasizes it does so as seminoma in 65 percent of the cases; in the remainder of the cases the metastases contain other germ-cell tumor components, such as embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, or teratoma. In one series bone metastases were found in 47 percent of the patients with a testicular seminoma at autopsy. Bredael et al. found bone metastases in 9 of 16 (56 percent) patients with a pure seminoma at postmortem examination; other sites of metastasis were the liver (81 percent), the lung (75 percent), and the brain (25 percent). Those authors also stated that seminoma has a higher tendency to metastasize to bone than other germ-cell tumors.\\nIn conclusion, the anatomical diagnosis is seminoma of the testis metastatic to the C4 region.\\nDR. SCULLY: Dr. Harmon, will you give the followup findings on the patient?\\nDr. Harmon: Having a diagnosis of a malignant tumor in the epidural space threatening the cervical spinal cord, with no evidence of disease elsewhere, we chose to begin with a course of radiotherapy to the cervical spine. In an HIV-positive patient whose immune system is limited, how much farther should one go in treatment of a metastatic but potentially curable malignant tumor? Whether to use aggressive combination chemotherapy or to try a single agent, carboplatin, which has also been described as potentially curative, would depend on the patient\\'s ability to tolerate myelosuppression. We have started with our first course of chemotherapy, using carboplatin, and we shall see how this patient tolerates it. I think that he still has a reasonable chance for a cure at this point.\\nDR. LETVIN: In considering the approach to chemotherapy in this patient I think that it is important to keep in mind that he does not have AIDS. He is infected with HIV and has HIV-induced persistent generalized lymphadenopathy. However, he has not presented with any manifestations that suggest that he has frank AIDS. That observation might argue for an aggressive course of treatment in a disease such as this one, which is certainly curable with aggressive chemotherapy in the vast proportion of the cases.',\n",

The same ticks also transmit human babesiosis (Babesia microti) in the United States and tick-borne encephalitis\\nin Europe and Asia. The adult ticks are parasites of deer, but the spirochete is acquired when the larval stage feeds on a mouse.\\nThe small nymph (shown on a blade of grass in Panel A) is found on low vegetation between early May and mid-July. It is only about the\\nsize of a poppy seed. When brushed onto a passing mouse or a person\\'s feet, nymphs attach and feed for a few days (but only once).\\nSpirochetes may infect about a third of nymphs, which are the stage of the deer tick that most often transmits the agent of Lyme disease\\nto humans.\\nThe posterior portion of the apple-seed-sized adult female deer tick (Panel B) is marked by an orange-red crescent. More than half the\\nticks in this winter-feeding stage may be infected. These adult deer ticks are found on grass or brush at the height of a person\\'s knees.\\nShown for comparison is the adult stage of the more familiar dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis), which is larger than 1. dammini. The dog\\ntick does not transmit the agent of Lyme disease.\\nAdult deer ticks attach to their hosts for a week or more. They feed by inserting their mouthparts deep into the skin of their hosts, as\\nshown here on the skin of an albino hamster (Panels C and D).

       " 'A 49-year-old woman was admitted to the hospi-\\ntal because of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and\\nweight loss.\\nThe patient was well until six years earlier, when\\nsplenomegaly was found. The hematocrit ranged up to\\n55.1 percent, the white-cell count to 11,500 (11.5×109\\nper liter), and the platelet count to 717,000 (717×109\\nper liter). A nephrotomographic examination and\\nechocardiographic study were negative. A diagnosis of\\npolycythemia vera was made; phlebotomy was per-\\nformed on three occasions, and the hematocrit there-\\nafter remained normal.\\nFive years before admission alopecia developed.\\nOne year later the patient began to experience pro-\\ngressive numbness of the toes, feet, and shins, with\\nRaynaud\\'s phenomenon, fatigue, polyarthralgia, and\\nmild hyperpigmentation of the forehead; splenomeg-\\naly persisted. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate\\nranged from 70 to 80 mm per hour. A test for antinu-\\nclear antibodies was positive in a titer of 1:64 (homo-\\ngeneous); tests for rheumatoid factor, anti-native\\nDNA antibodies, and cryoprecipitate were negative,\\nand the results of repeated complement studies were\\nnormal. Microscopical examination of a needle-biop-\\nsy specimen of the bone marrow and a computed\\ntomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen were negative\\nexcept for the presence of hepatosplenomegaly. Motor\\nand sensory-nerve conduction studies and an electro-\\nmyographic examination showed a severe, symmetric\\ndistal peripheral neuropathy. A diagnosis of systemic\\nlupus erythematosus was made; treatment was begun\\nwith prednisone and hydroxychloroquine, although\\nthe latter medication was later discontinued because\\nof abdominal discomfort. Repeated abdominal CT\\nscans revealed no evidence of a malignant tumor.\\nPleural effusions were noted intermittently on radio-\\ngraphic studies within the year before entry. During that year the patient had recurrent episodes of depres-\\nsion and was twice admitted to hospitals for anti-\\ndepressant medication. Eight months before admis-\\nsion she began to have visual loss and experienced\\nseveral bouts of diplopia that lasted for approximately\\nhalf an hour. Further evaluation disclosed bilateral\\npapilledema. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of\\nthe cranium was negative, and a lumbar puncture\\nyielded normal cerebrospinal fluid although the initial\\npressure was 280 mm of water. A diagnosis of pseudo-\\ntumor cerebri was made, and acetazolamide was add-\\ned to the medication. Four months before entry inter-\\nmittent abdominal pain developed, with nausea and\\nvomiting.\\nThree weeks before admission the patient was re-\\nferred to this hospital, where physical examination\\nshowed that the blood pressure was 120/75 mm Hg;\\nshe was cachectic, with generalized hyperpigmenta-\\ntion and prominent hepatosplenomegaly. An electro-\\ncardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 103,\\nwith left posterior hemiblock and clockwise rotation.\\nThe findings on review of multiple recent imaging\\nstudies obtained elsewhere included a small left pleu-\\nral effusion and a retrocardiac infiltrate on an x-ray\\nfilm of the chest. A CT scan of the abdomen (Fig. 1)\\nrevealed bilateral pleural effusions; moderate ascites;\\nperipancreatic, paraaortic, and retrocaval lymphade-\\nnopathy; marked enlargement of the spleen, which\\ncontained calcifications; hepatomegaly; and enlarge-\\nment of the uterus, which contained a leiomyoma.\\nOn the day before entry the patient awoke with\\nsevere nausea and upper abdominal pain and vomited\\nbile-stained liquid on approximately five occasions.\\nShe passed a formed brown stool. After dinner she\\nvomited and began to have severe pain in the left up-\\nper abdominal quadrant that radiated to the back,\\npunctuated by spasms of more severe, \"knife-like\"\\npain in the left upper quadrant that lasted one to five\\nminutes and occurred five to six times per hour. She\\nreturned to this hospital.\\nThe patient\\'s husband and three children were well.\\nShe had a history of a \"nervous stomach,\" for which\\nphenobarbital was prescribed during her adolescence.\\nA small duodenal ulcer was found 10 years before ad-\\nmission. She had irregular menses for two years. She\\nhad lost 13.6 kg during the six months before entry\\nand 2.7 kg in the immediately preceding two weeks. A\\nprogressive decline in the serum albumin had been\\nnoted over the past several months. There was a histo-\\nry of heart disease in both parents; her father had\\ndiabetes mellitus, and her mother and a sister had\\nsevere lactose intolerance; six other siblings were well.\\nThe temperature was 37°C, the pulse was 110, and\\nthe respirations were 20. The blood pressure was\\n110/60 mm Hg.\\nOn physical examination the patient was cachectic\\nand had mild discomfort from abdominal pain. Gener-\\nalized hyperpigmentation was present. A lymph node,\\n3 cm, was palpated in the right axilla and another\\nlymph node, 1 cm, was felt in the left axilla. The edge\\nof the liver descended 7 cm below the right costal\\nmargin, and the spleen descended 8 cm below the left;\\nthere was mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness; no mass\\nwas palpated. The fingers were cold and mildly cya-\\nnotic, and there was trace pedal edema; no digital\\nclubbing was seen; the peripheral pulses were normal.\\nThe patient was fully alert and oriented. Cranial-\\nnerve functions were preserved. Muscle strength and\\nsensation were intact except that muscle power was\\ngraded 4/5 in the lower extremities, with impaired\\nsensation.\\nThe urine gave a + test for protein; the sediment\\ncontained 15 white cells, 2 red cells, 8 hyaline casts,\\nand a few bacteria per high-power field. The hem-\\natocrit, white-cell count, differential count, platelet\\ncount, prothrombin time, and partial-thromboplastin\\ntime were normal. The creatinine, glucose, calcium,\\nphosphorus, other electrolytes, bilirubin, and a ran-\\ndom cortisol level were normal. The serum aspartate\\naminotransferase, creatine kinase, alkaline phospha-\\ntase, amylase, and the dehydrogenase were normal. A\\ntest for beta-human chorionic gonadotropin was nega-\\ntive. Additional laboratory findings are presented in\\nTable 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachy-\\ncardia at a rate of 108; the R-wave axis was +131\\ndegrees, and clockwise rotation was present; the ap-\\npearance was unchanged in comparison with an elec-\\ntrocardiogram obtained several weeks earlier. Radio-\\ngraphs of the chest revealed elevation of the right\\nhemidiaphragm; a density lateral to the heart filled the\\nright cardiophrenic angle; the left costophrenic angle\\nwas blunted, a finding consistent with a small pleural\\neffusion; the remaining lung fields were clear. X-ray\\nfilms of the abdomen disclosed marked enlargement\\nof the liver and spleen; the pattern of bowel gas was\\nnormal. X-ray films of the bones were normal; calci-\\nfied lymph nodes were observed in the abdomen and\\npelvis.\\nFluids and methylprednisolone were administered\\nby vein, and meperidine was injected intramuscularly\\nas needed for pain. The nausea and vomiting ceased;\\nthe patient remained afebrile. Examination with a fi-\\nberoptic esophagogastroduodenoscope showed mild,\\ndiffuse gastritis with bile-stained secretions that had a\\npH of 4.0; the duodenum was normal except for en-\\nlargement of the ampulla of Vater and a polyp, 9 mm,\\njust distal to the ampulla, which was removed. Micro-\\nscopical examination of biopsy specimens disclosed\\nthat the duodenal polyp was a hamartoma; a minute\\nfragment of the ampulla of Vater contained fibroglan-\\ndular tissue with mucinous metaplasia and chronic\\npapillitis; specimens of the gastric antrum and the\\nduodenum showed no abnormality; no amyloid was\\nseen, and there was no evidence of Whipple\\'s disease,\\nparasitic infestation, or neoplasm.\\nOn the third hospital day physical examination re-\\nmained unchanged except that the abdomen was non-\\ntender. A culture of urine obtained on admission\\nyielded abundant Escherichia coli. Trimethoprim-sul-\\nfamethoxazole was begun. An upper gastrointestinal\\nseries with small-bowel study revealed that the esoph-\\nagus was normal; the stomach and duodenum ap-\\npeared normal except for compression of the stomach\\nby the large liver and spleen; barium passed rapidly\\nthrough the small bowel and appeared in the cecum in\\napproximately 10 minutes; the visible portions of the\\ncecum appeared normal. A later enteroclysis examina-\\ntion of the small bowel showed no abnormality. Tests\\nfor antinuclear antibodies and for antibodies to native\\nDNA were negative.\\nA laboratory report was received.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDr. David STEINBERG*: This 49-year-old woman\\nwas cachectic and ill after a six-year history of a puz-\\nzling systemic disorder that was initially diagnosed as\\npolycythemia vera. The findings included a severe\\nsymmetric distal peripheral neuropathy, generalized\\nhyperpigmentation of the skin, lymphadenopathy,\\nhepatosplenomegaly, ascites, pleural effusions, poly-\\narthralgias, Raynaud\\'s phenomenon, and pseudotu-\\nmor cerebri.\\nMay we review the radiologic studies?\\nDR. JOSEPH T. FERRUCCI, JR.: A section from the CT\\nscan of the abdomen obtained three weeks before ad-\\nmission (Fig. 1) shows considerable hepatomegaly\\nand enlargement of the spleen to four or five times its\\nusual size, with a 1-cm punctate area of calcification\\nvisible within it. Other pertinent findings are a small\\namount of ascitic fluid in the flanks and a number of\\nsmall retroperitoneal lymph nodes. A representative\\nradiograph of the chest reveals no obvious air-space\\ndisease or gross pleural effusion. The architecture of\\nthe bones is normal, with no focal lytic or blastic le-\\nsions.\\nDR. STEINBERG: Did the CT scan show the high\\nattenuation of the liver that is seen with excess iron\\ndeposition?\\nDR. FERRUCCI: No.\\nDR. STEINBERG: The challenge is to find the system-\\nic illness that will best explain the unusual collection\\nof findings in this case.\\nA low-grade lymphoma is a possible, although\\nunlikely, diagnosis. It would explain the hepatosple-\\nnomegaly and lymphadenopathy. The sensorimotor\\nperipheral neuropathy could be explained as a para-\\nneoplastic process. However, transient pleural effu-\\nsions, Raynaud\\'s phenomenon, pseudotumor cerebri,\\nand generalized hyperpigmentation of the skin are not\\neasily explained by a diagnosis of lymphoma. Also,\\nwhen pursued by an assiduous physician, lymphoma\\nrarely remains undiagnosed for six years.\\nSarcoidosis could also account for the hepatospleno-\\nmegaly and lymphadenopathy. Although uncommon,\\nperipheral neuropathy and an elevated spinal fluid\\nprotein level can be found in patients with sarcoido-\\nsis. It is difficult to interpret the arthralgias, but sar-\\ncoidosis can involve the joints. Dermal granulomas\\ncan be seen in sarcoidosis, but not generalized hyper-\\npigmentation. Pleural effusion is rare in sarcoidosis.\\nAlthough the absence of bilateral hilar lymphadenop-\\nathy does not exclude sarcoidosis, it leaves me with no\\ncompelling reason to make that diagnosis.\\nPeripheral neuropathy, dermal melanosis, abdomi-\\nnal pain, and a psychiatric disturbance, such as de-\\npression, are features of this patient\\'s illness that have\\nbeen described in variegate porphyria. Peripheral\\nneuropathy also occurs in association with that dis-\\nease, but in contrast to the history in this case it is\\nusually preceded by attacks of abdominal pain or\\nmental disturbance and the upper limbs are usually\\nmost affected. Although hyperpigmentation was de-\\nscribed in this patient, there is no mention of the bul-\\nlae, erosions, and ulcers that follow minor trauma to\\nlight-exposed skin that characterize the dermal lesions\\nof variegate porphyria. The failure of phenobarbital,\\nwhich was given to this patient, to precipitate an at-\\ntack further lessens the likelihood of variegate por-\\nphyria but does not exclude the diagnosis. Also, no\\nfamily history of porphyria was mentioned, and many\\nother findings in this patient would not be explained\\nby that diagnosis.\\nThe diagnosis of polycythemia vera six years before\\nadmission was a reasonable but not established diag-\\nnosis. Except for a uterine leiomyoma, which has been\\nassociated with an increased red-cell mass in some\\npatients, there was no obvious reason for secondary\\nerythrocytosis. The combination of an increased red-\\ncell mass and splenomegaly has been accepted as suffi-\\ncient for the diagnosis of polycythemia vera. Although\\na hematocrit of 55 percent in a woman suggests an\\nincreased red-cell mass, the red-cell mass was never\\nmeasured directly in this patient. A decreased plasma\\nvolume or a difference between the peripheral hemato-\\ncrit and the total body hematocrit can result in spuri-\\nous erythrocytosis. The slightly elevated white-cell\\ncount and the elevated platelet count add to the\\nprobability of polycythemia vera, but these findings\\nare not specific. Correction of the erythrocytosis with\\nonly three phlebotomies casts some doubt on the diag-\\nnosis, but in a menstruating woman it could be ex-\\nplained by iron deficiency. Other explanations for the\\ntransient nature of the erythrocytosis might include\\nthe development of an unrecognized second illness\\nthat inhibited erythropoiesis or, less likely in such a\\nshort time, the onset of postpolycythemic myeloid\\nmetaplasia.\\nMyeloid metaplasia could have developed, how-\\never, by the time of her admission several years later.\\nSome of the findings at that time could be explained\\nby extramedullary hematopoiesis. Lymphadenopathy\\nhas been described in a minority of patients with mye-\\nloid metaplasia. Although clinically important lym-\\nphadenopathy is unusual, it has been described. Ex-\\ntramedullary hematopoiesis has been found in many\\norgans, including the liver, spleen, and other abdomi-\\nnal viscera and the pleura, and could explain at least\\nin part the hepatosplenomegaly, pleural effusions, and\\nascites. The argument for extramedullary hematopoi-\\nesis is weakened by the absence of some of the impor-\\ntant signs of myeloid metaplasia. The patient did not\\nhave anemia, an almost invariable finding in myeloid\\nmetaplasia. Also, she did not have the characteristic\\nleukoerythroblastic blood smear. A bone marrow bi-\\nopsy might have been helpful, but we are told only\\nthat the results of one performed four years earlier\\nwere normal.\\nAbdominal pain, ascites, hepatomegaly, spleno-\\nmegaly, nausea, and vomiting, which occurred during\\nthe last hospital admission, are seen with occlusion of\\nthe hepatic veins, the Budd-Chiari syndrome. If she\\nhad polycythemia vera, this diagnosis should be con-\\nsidered. In one review of 253 patients with hepatic-\\nvein thrombosis¹¹ the most common underlying illness\\nwas polycythemia vera.\\nSome of the unusual features of this patient\\'s illness\\nare not readily explained by the diagnosis of polycy-\\nthemia vera. Although peripheral neuropathy has\\nbeen described in association with polycythemia, it is\\nuncommon. Pinkness and venous distention may be\\nseen on examination of the optic disk, but pseudotu-\\nmor cerebri is not a typical finding. Patients with\\nerythrocytosis may have a ruddy, plethoric complex-\\nion, but this woman is described as having generalized\\nhyperpigmentation at a time when her hematocrit was\\nnormal. Although she may have once had erythrocyto-\\nsis and thrombocytosis, it is difficult to invoke polycy-\\nthemia vera or a subsequent myeloid metaplasia as the\\nsole explanation for her complex clinical picture.\\nSome of the findings in this case suggest hemochro-\\nmatosis. Hyperpigmentation of the skin in hemochro-\\nmatosis may be the result of deposition of both iron\\nand melanin. Hepatosplenomegaly, arthralgias, ab-\\ndominal pain, and ascites may be manifestations of\\nhemochromatosis. The absence of a family history of\\nhemochromatosis might simply reflect the fact that the\\ndiagnosis is often overlooked. However, the CT scan\\ndid not show the high attenuation in the liver that is\\ndemonstrated in excess iron deposition, and we do not\\nhave the benefit of serum iron or ferritin values. More-\\nover, a diagnosis of hemochromatosis leaves many\\nfeatures unexplained.\\nRaynaud\\'s phenomenon, arthralgias, and distal\\nmotor weakness are seen in systemic sclerosis (sclero-\\nderma). The weakness is often the result of disuse\\natrophy or a primary myopathy, but neuropathy has\\nbeen reported. Hyperpigmentation is a feature of\\nscleroderma, but this patient did not have the charac-\\nteristic thick, hard skin. Also, she did not have esopha-\\ngeal motility dysfunction, which occurs in about 75\\npercent of the cases. I do not find a diagnosis of sys-\\ntemic sclerosis satisfying.\\nCould the diagnosis be amyloidosis? This patient\\'s\\nhepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy could\\nhave been the result of amyloid infiltration.14 How-\\never, lymphadenopathy is uncommon in amyloidosis,\\nand this patient\\'s spleen was larger than the typical\\nspleen involved by amyloidosis. 14 Peripheral neuropa-\\nthy was one of the first manifestations of her illness\\nand is the initial manifestation in 17 percent of pa-\\ntients with amyloidosis, which is associated with a\\ndistal symmetric, progressive neuropathy that can be\\npainful.15 Most patients with amyloid neuropathy\\nhave a monoclonal protein that is usually a lambda\\nlight chain. 15 An immunoelectrophoresis is not men-\\ntioned in this case record. This patient had both pro-\\nteinuria, which is a common manifestation of amyloid\\nnephropathy, and arthralgias, which could be as-\\ncribed to early amyloid arthropathy. She had alopecia\\nand increased skin pigmentation, which have been ob-\\nserved in amyloidosis; however, she did not have any\\nof the other dermal manifestations of amyloidosis,\\nsuch as purpura, ecchymoses, waxy nodules, and\\nthickened skin. Results of laboratory tests are nonspe-\\ncific for amyloidosis, and ultimately a microscopical\\ndiagnosis is required. A small-bowel biopsy was nega-\\ntive for amyloid deposition, leaving it only a theoreti-\\ncal possibility.\\nIn 1984 Nakanishi and his colleagues 16 reported\\nfrom Japan 102 cases of an unusual systemic dis-\\norder that they called the \"Crow-Fukase syndrome,\"\\nnaming it after early reporters of the syndrome.\\nThe syndrome has also been called the PEP syndrome\\n(a peculiar progressive polyneuritis associated with\\npigmentation, edema, and plasma-cell dyscrasia), 17\\n\"Shimpo\\'s syndrome, \"18 and the \"Takatsuki syn-\\ndrome.\" 19 In the United States it has been more popu-\\nlarly referred to as the POEMS syndrome - polyneu-\\nropathy (P), organomegaly (O), endocrinopathy (E),\\nM proteins (M), and skin changes (S).20 Not every\\npatient, however, has all the findings, and the acro-\\nnym does not encompass every manifestation of this\\nremarkable disorder. I believe that this patient had\\nthe POEMS syndrome. I shall discuss the findings by\\ngoing through the acronym letter by letter, and then I\\nshall discuss the other manifestations of the syn-\\ndrome.\\nIn some reviews 19,20 polyneuropathy has been re-\\nported in 100 percent of patients with the POEMS\\nsyndrome, but its absence has also been noted. 21\\nThe polyneuropathy presents initially or early in the\\ncourse as a progressive distal, symmetric sensorimotor\\ndeficit, which spreads proximally. Weakness in the\\narms and legs can be profound and accompanied by\\nmuscle wasting. Motor and sensory nerve-conduction\\nvelocities are greatly slowed. 16,20 Nerve biopsies reveal\\ndegeneration of myelin sheaths and axons. 16,19,20,22\\nCranial-nerve involvement is rare. These findings are\\nsimilar to those in this patient except that normal cere-\\nbrospinal fluid is unusual for the syndrome. An elevat-\\ned cerebrospinal fluid protein level was found in one\\nseries 16 in 93 of 96 patients evaluated, and not uncom-\\nmonly the level was more than 200 mg per 100 ml.\\nTypically, the cerebrospinal fluid cell count is normal.\\nOrganomegaly refers to the hepatomegaly, spleno-\\nmegaly, and diffuse lymphadenopathy found in 82\\npercent, 39 percent, and 65 percent, respectively, of\\npatients with the POEMS syndrome, 16 and all these\\nfindings were seen in this patient.\\nFailure of multiple endocrine organs is common in\\nthe POEMS syndrome. Gonadal failure with amenor-\\nrhea and impotence, gynecomastia, primary hypothy-\\nroidism, and diabetes have been reported. 16,20,23-25 Ele-\\nvated prolactin and estrogen levels have been found. 24\\nThe only possible endocrine abnormality in this pa-\\ntient, irregular menses, could have been age-related or\\ncaused by her debilitated condition. Although most\\npatients with the syndrome have an endocrine abnor-\\nmality, not all do, and its apparent absence in this\\nwoman does not exclude the diagnosis.\\nAn M component is found in 60 to 75 percent of the\\npatients, with IgG slightly more common than IgA. In\\ncontrast to M components in multiple myeloma, in\\nwhich kappa light chains outnumber lambda light\\nchains about 2 to 1, the vast majority of M compo-\\nnents in the POEMS syndrome have lambda light\\nchains. 16,19,20 These abnormal proteins may have a role\\nin the pathogenesis of the disorder. Polyclonal hyper-\\nglobulinemia and the POEMS syndrome have been\\nreported in patients exposed to toxic substances, such\\nas organic solvents and agricultural chemicals. 16 The\\nnormal total globulin level in this patient does not\\nexclude the POEMS syndrome, because M protein\\nlevels can be low.\\nGeneralized hyperpigmentation of the type seen in\\nthis patient has been described in more than 90 per-\\ncent of patients with the POEMS syndrome. 16,20 Oth-\\ner dermal abnormalities include hypertrichosis, with\\ncoarse, dark hair primarily on the extensor surfaces, 26\\nwhite nails, hyperhidrosis, and skin thickening, which\\nmight be confused with scleroderma.27-29 Alopecia,\\nwhich was one of the earliest abnormalities mentioned\\nin this case, is not included in most reviews. Digital\\nclubbing and cutaneous angiomas, which were not\\npresent in this patient, have been reported. 16 Cyano-\\nsis, which was seen in this case, is another feature of\\nthe syndrome. 30,31 Idiopathic skin flushing mimicking\\nthe carcinoid syndrome32 and dermal mastocytosis 33\\nhave also been reported.\\nSeveral features that are seen in patients with the\\nPOEMS syndrome but that are not included in the\\nacronym were seen in this patient. Edema, pleural\\neffusions that can be transient, and ascites that can be\\nrefractory to treatment are not uncommon. 16,20 It has\\nbeen suggested that these features result from an in-\\ncrease in capillary permeability.34 Raynaud\\'s phe-\\nnomenon, which this patient had, is also associated\\nwith the POEMS syndrome. 20\\nComputed tomographic examination of the abdo-\\nmen showed an enlarged spleen with calcification.\\nSplenic calcification is seen in tuberculosis, histoplas-\\nmosis, and brucellosis. This patient was not febrile,\\nand the clinical picture did not suggest an infectious\\ndisease. Splenic calcification is also seen with splenic\\ninfarcts and hemangiomas and in Castleman\\'s dis-\\nease, a disorder with pathological findings similar\\nto the lesions seen in some patients with the POEMS\\nsyndrome. Therefore, it may not be necessary to in-\\nvoke another diagnosis to explain the splenic calcifi-\\ncation.\\nAlthough I concluded earlier that this woman\\'s\\nillness could not be well explained by the diagnosis\\nof polycythemia vera alone, the finding of an ele-\\nvated hematocrit early in the course of her illness is\\nprobably not irrelevant because the association of\\npolycythemia and thrombocytosis with the POEMS\\nsyndrome has been well described, 26,37,38 and polycy-\\nthemia, as in this patient, has preceded the diagnosis\\nof the POEMS syndrome. 37 Papilledema with in-\\ncreased intracranial pressure without apparent struc-\\ntural abnormality (pseudotumor cerebri) is common\\nin the POEMS syndrome. It developed in 56 of\\n91 patients (62 percent) described by Nakanishi et\\nal. 16 16 Swelling of the optic disk, the result of an infil-\\ntrative orbitopathy, has also been reported.39 Finally,\\nthis patient had mild proteinuria. Although it is a\\nnonspecific finding and the creatinine level was nor-\\nmal, a microangiopathic glomerulopathy is yet an-\\nother manifestation of the POEMS syndrome. 40,41\\nThe POEMS syndrome is a rare disorder, although\\nwith greater awareness more cases are being recog-\\nnized. The frequency among men is greater than that\\namong women, and the age at the time of onset ranges\\nfrom 27 to 80 years. 16 The average age is 46 years,\\nabout the age of this patient; most patients are in their\\nlate 30s or 40s. Data on survival are limited, but the\\ncourse can be prolonged.\\nThe POEMS syndrome is not a final pathological\\ndiagnosis. One must ask what underlying illness can\\nproduce a disorder with such protean manifestations.\\nA distal symmetric peripheral polyneuropathy simi-\\nlar to that seen in the POEMS syndrome has been\\ndescribed in about 50 percent of patients with osteo-\\nsclerotic myeloma. Many patients with osteosclerotic\\nmyeloma and peripheral neuropathy have been re-\\nported to have a systemic illness that resembles the\\nPOEMS syndrome. 20,24,42,43 In one series of patients\\nwith the POEMS syndrome 16 the clinical manifesta-\\ntions of those with and without sclerotic bone lesions\\nwere similar. It is postulated that substances elaborat-\\ned by malignant plasma cells inhibit the activity of\\ntrophic hormones, 25 stimulate melanin secretion, have\\nangiogenic activity, and stimulate both red-cell and\\nplatelet production. The causative role of the plasma\\ncell is supported by the finding that the POEMS syn-\\ndrome may regress slowly if there is a solitary lesion\\nthat can be removed or irradiated. The response to\\nsystemic chemotherapy when multiple sclerotic le-\\nsions are present is less satisfying. 19,38 In contrast to\\npatients with typical multiple myeloma, those with\\nosteosclerotic myeloma are younger, present more\\noften with peripheral neuropathy, have bone pain less\\nfrequently, have a more indolent course, and have in-\\nvolvement of lymph nodes and the spleen more fre-\\nquently. The M components are small and with few\\nexceptions contain lambda light chains. Bone lesions\\ncan be sclerotic, mixed sclerotic and lytic, or cystic\\nwith a rim of sclerosis. They are either solitary or\\nmultiple; when multiple, the number of lesions is usu-\\nally limited. The extremities and the skull are spared,\\nand examination of the bone marrow usually does not\\nshow multiple myeloma. A skeletal survey in this pa-\\ntient showed no sclerotic lesions; therefore, I must look\\nelsewhere for the underlying diagnosis.\\nMost of the patients with the POEMS syndrome\\ndescribed by Nakanishi et al. 16 had histologic changes\\nin the lymph nodes resembling those of Castleman\\'s\\ndisease, 35,45 also known as \"angiofollicular lymph-\\nnode hyperplasia,\" \"benign giant lymphoma,\" and\\n\"angiomatous lymphoid hamartoma.\" 23 The lesions\\nare most common in the mediastinum but are also\\nfound in other areas. 35 Two types have been described\\nthe hyaline vascular type and the plasma-cell\\ntype.35 In the early cases the lesions were solitary, but\\ncases with multicentric lesions have been reported\\nsubsequently. 46 The plasma-cell variant of Castle-\\nman\\'s disease is found more commonly in the abdo-\\nmen47,48 and may be associated with systemic symp-\\ntoms and a variety of laboratory abnormalities. 48 The\\nplasma-cell proliferation is typically polyclonal, but\\nmonoclonal plasma-cell components may develop. 23,48\\nThe pathological findings in some patients with the\\nPOEMS syndrome resemble those of multicentric\\nCastleman\\'s disease of the plasma-cell type. Similar\\npathological findings have been seen in patients with\\nhuman immunodeficiency virus infection48 and in\\npatients in whom non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, plasma-\\ncytoma, and Kaposi\\'s sarcoma subsequently devel-\\noped. 23 These patients and patients with the POEMS\\nsyndrome may have a disorder similar to but not iden-\\ntical with Castleman\\'s disease. Therefore, I shall refer\\nto the suspected pathological findings in this patient as\\nmulticentric angiofollicular lymph-node hyperplasia\\nof the plasma-cell type.\\nMulticentric angiofollicular lymph-node hyperpla-\\nsia of the plasma-cell type and osteosclerotic myeloma\\nare both associated with the POEMS syndrome, and\\nboth have been seen in the same patient. How are\\nthese entities related, and why do they behave differ-\\nently from ordinary myeloma? Frizzera 48 postulated\\nthat both these entities are disorders of lymph-node-\\nbound lymphocytes, in contrast to bone marrow-\\nassociated and mucosa-associated lymphocytes. This\\ntheory explains why osteosclerotic myeloma frequent-\\nly involves the lymph nodes and the spleen.\\nMy final diagnosis is the POEMS syndrome, pos-\\nsibly associated with multicentric angiofollicular\\nlymph-node hyperplasia of the plasma-cell type. The\\nlaboratory test reported was probably an immunoelec-\\ntrophoresis that revealed the presence of a monoclonal\\nprotein. The odds slightly favor an IgG over IgA;\\nabout 90 percent of patients with the POEMS syn-\\ndrome have lambda light chains.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nPOEMS syndrome.\\nDR. DAVID STEINBERG\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nPOEMS syndrome, possibly associated with mul-\\nticentric angiofollicular lymph-node hyperplasia\\nof plasma-cell type.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. NANCY L. HARRIS: Dr. Bloch will discuss the\\nresults of the diagnostic tests.\\nDR. KURT J. BLOCH: On immunoelectrophoresis of\\nserum the IgG and IgA precipitin arcs were abnormal;\\nthe IgM arc was normal. The concentrations of the\\nimmunoglobulins were as follows: IgG 1080 mg, IgA\\n254 mg, and IgM 264 mg per 100 ml. Agarose-gel\\nelectrophoresis showed three low-concentration ab-\\nnormal bands; on immunofixation these were identi-\\nfied as an IgA lambda protein, an IgG lambda pro-\\ntein, and an IgG kappa protein. These findings\\nsupport the diagnosis of the POEMS syndrome in this\\npatient.\\nDR. HARRIS: After receipt of the immunoelectro-\\nphoretic findings confirming the diagnosis of the\\nPOEMS syndrome, an axillary lymph-node biopsy\\nwas performed. Microscopical examination showed\\nunusual features that defied a precise diagnosis. Por-\\ntions of the lymph node showed a peculiar follicular\\nhyperplasia, with lymphoid follicles of varying size,\\nmost of which had reactive germinal centers and\\nbroad mantle zones. Some of these follicles were hya-\\nlinized with concentric whorls of lymphoid cells con-\\nsistent with Castleman\\'s disease (Fig. 2). In other\\nareas of the node there were large, closely packed folli-\\ncles that replaced the nodal architecture, suggesting a\\nfollicular lymphoma (Fig. 3). However, some of these\\nfollicles also contained small hyaline vascular centers,\\nreminiscent of angiofollicular hyperplasia (Fig. 4),\\nand there was prominent vascular proliferation in the\\ninterfollicular regions. In the centers of these large folli-\\ncles the predominant cells were small, cleaved follicular-\\ncenter cells, with only small numbers of trans-\\nformed cells, a finding very suggestive of a follicular\\nlymphoma of predominantly small, cleaved-cell type.\\nIn some follicles the mantle zone was replaced by an\\natypical proliferation of cells that distorted the follicu-\\nlar center (Fig. 5). The interfollicular region contained\\nnumerous small blood vessels, predominantly small\\nlymphocytes, with no evidence of an increased num-\\nber of plasma cells.\\nImmunoperoxidase stains showed that the follicles\\ncontained predominantly B cells, but with an admix-\\nture of polyclonal T cells, and no evidence of a mono-\\nclonal B-cell population, either lymphocytic or plas-\\nmacytoid. The atypical follicles appeared to be immu-\\nnoblastin-negative, with surrounding mantle zones\\nof polyclonal B cells; this is an abnormal phenotype\\nbut is not in and of itself diagnostic of lymphoma.\\nTissue was analyzed for evidence of immunoglobulin\\nheavy-chain gene rearrangement, with the use of the\\nSouthern blot technique, and no clonal rearranged\\nband could be detected.\\nIn summary, this is a very unusual lymphoid prolif-\\neration, which has some morphologic features sugges-\\ntive of Castleman\\'s disease of the hyaline-vascular\\ntype and other features suggestive of a follicular lym-\\nphoma.\\nThe diagnosis of the POEMS syndrome is a clinical\\nand immunologic one, based on the typical clinical\\nfeatures and the presence of an M component. As Dr.\\nSteinberg has suggested, the histologic findings are\\nvariable and range from osteosclerotic myeloma to\\nthe plasma-cell variant of Castleman\\'s disease, with a\\nnumber of reported cases showing simply lymphoid\\nhyperplasia.20,21\\nDr. Kradin, do you have follow-up information on\\nthis patient?\\nDR.

MCNEELY, Assistant EditorCASE 40-1992PRESENTATION OF CASEA 43-year-old man was admitted to the hospitalbecause of recurrent fever and abdominal pain.The patient was well until 14 years earlier, when hehad an illness characterized by fever with a maximaltemperature of 39.4°C, chills, sweats, myalgias, andheadache. He remained in bed at home for threemonths and received no treatment other than havingheated metal coins rubbed over his body. Nine yearsbefore entry he immigrated to this country from hisnative Cambodia, after having been interned for 32months in refugee camps in Thailand and Indonesia.Eight years before admission the patient was firstseen at this hospital for a routine examination, whichwas negative. A complete blood count was normal, aswell as the glucose, urea nitrogen, electrolytes, total pro-tein, albumin, globulin, serum aspartate aminotrans-ferase (ASAT), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and al-kaline phosphatase, and an x-ray film of the chest wasnormal. A tuberculin skin test (PPD, 5 TU) was posi-tive. A test for hepatitis B surface antigen was positive,and a test for hepatitis B surface antibody was nega-tive. Microscopical examination of a stool specimenshowed no ova or parasites. Isoniazid was prescribed,but the patient did not take the medication. Duringthe next few years he experienced several bouts of painin the left upper abdominal quadrant that was usuallymild and resolved in a few days.Five years before entry the patient returned to thishospital because of fever and abdominal pain. Thetemperature was 39°C. Physical examination revealeddiffuse abdominal tenderness that was most markedon the left side. Laboratory studies, including micro-scopical examination of a thick blood smear for malar-ial parasites, were negative. An ultrasonographic ex-amination of the upper abdomen, performed severalweeks after the resolution of the patient\\'s symptoms,was negative; no evidence of hydronephrosis was de-tected, and the spleen was not enlarged. During a sim-ilar attack 17 months before admission the splenic tipwas palpated. A complete blood count was normal,and microscopical examination of stool specimensshowed no ova or parasites. An x-ray film of the chestrevealed a metallic density in the left axillary arearelated to a land mine explosion in Cambodia. A ra-diograph of the abdomen was normal. On several oth-er occasions the patient had mild bouts of fever andabdominal pain that subsided in one to three days.Six days before entry the patient had another at-tack, and three days later he returned to his physicianbecause of dizziness, nausea, mild dysuria, headache,and generalized body pain in addition to his usualsymptoms. The temperature was 38.4°C. Physical ex-amination disclosed only mild tenderness in the leftcostovertebral angle. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxa-zole was prescribed. The urine was normal. The hem-atocrit was 43.6 percent; the white-cell count was 4500(4.5×10º per liter), with 63 percent neutrophils, 9 per-cent band forms, 23 percent lymphocytes, 2 percentmonocytes, and 3 percent atypical lymphocytes. Theurea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose were normal.The symptoms did not improve, and two days later hewas seen at the emergency room of another hospital,where a specimen was taken for blood culture. Ampi-cillin (2 g) and gentamicin (100 mg) were injected byvein, and he was referred to this hospital.The patient had worked as a rice farmer in Cambo-dia. Since arriving in this country he operated a creamseparator in a dairy. His wife and three children werewell. There was no history of extramarital sexualpractices, use of recreational drugs, clinical hepatitis,malaria, parasitic diseases, weight loss, or return trav-el to Southeast Asia at any time.The temperature was 39.7°C, the pulse was 108,and the respirations were 28. The blood pressure was100/65 mm Hg.On examination the patient was thin and appearedmildly ill. No rash or lymphadenopathy was found; afuruncle was noted in the left antecubital fossa. Thehead, neck, lungs, and heart were normal. A slightlytender spleen was palpated 6 cm below the left costalmargin; the liver was not felt, and no abdominal mass,ascitic fluid, or spasm was detected.

A radiograph of the chest was normal exceptfor elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. A radiographof the abdomen was normal. An ultrasonographic ex-amination of the abdomen showed that the spleen was18 cm long, and several perihilar hypoechoic areasranged up to 2 cm in diameter. A computed tomo-graphic (CT) scan of the abdomen (Fig. 1), performedafter the oral administration of diatrizoate meglu-mine, disclosed marked enlargement of the spleen,which contained multiple calcifications and severallow-attenuation abnormalities that were up to 1 cm indiameter; there was a soft-tissue density between thespleen and the left hemidiaphragm; multiple roundedsoft-tissue densities, believed to reflect varices, wereobserved in the region of the splenic hilus; no retro-peritoneal lymphadenopathy was seen, and no focalabnormalities of the bowel wall were identified. Mi-croscopical examination of a stool specimen showedno ova or parasites; moderate numbers of yeast formswere present. Microscopical examination of threeGiemsa-stained blood smears for malarial parasiteswas negative. A test on the serum for hepatitis B sur-face antigen was positive, and a test for hepatitis Bsurface antibody was negative. A test for salmonellaagglutinins was negative except that group D was pos-itive in a titer of 160 (normal, 0 to 80), a finding thatwas considered not to be unusual for a patient of Cam-bodian origin. A serologic test for syphilis and tests foranti-native DNA, heterophil agglutinins, and anti-deoxyribonuclease B and agglutination tests for bru-cella and tularemia were negative. A stool examina-tion for Clostridium difficile toxin, five blood cultures,and two urine cultures were negative; urine and bloodsamples for culture for mycobacteria were obtained, aswell as a blood specimen for fungal culture. A tubercu-lin skin test (5 TU) was positive. Microscopical exam-ination of a needle-biopsy specimen of bone marrowrevealed a moderate increase in plasma cells and eo-sinophils; no malarial parasites were seen.Nafcillin and gentamicin were administered byvein. By the end of the second hospital day the patientR1588Figure 1.

On the eighth hospitalday a single dose of chloroquine was given by mouth,and the patient was discharged with instructions totake additional doses on the next two days.Ten days after discharge a repeated CT scan of theabdomen, performed after the oral administration ofcontrast material and before and after the intravenousinjection of contrast material, showed splenic enlarge-ment and an elliptical low-density fluid collection,3 by 9 cm, lateral to the spleen; the rim of the collec-tion enhanced after the injection of contrast material,revealing numerous septa within the lesion; severalfocal areas of decreased perfusion were seen with-in the splenic parenchyma on the images obtainedafter enhancement; no lymphadenopathy or free fluidwas found, and the liver, pancreas, adrenal glands,kidneys, and gallbladder appeared normal. Afterdischarge from the hospital, routine, fungal, andmycobacterial cultures of the bone marrow and amycobacterial culture of the urine and blood werenegative. An indirect immunofluorescence test forPlasmodium falciparum was positive in a titer of 1:256(normal, <1:64); tests for P. vivax, P. malariae, andP. ovale were negative.Three months after discharge the patient returnedto the hospital because of five days of fever with painin the left upper quadrant and left flank. On physi-cal examination the temperature was 36.7°C after anoral dose of acetaminophen. The spleen remained en-larged and tender.A diagnostic procedure was performed.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSISDR. PETER F. WELLER*: This 43-year-old man, whoemigrated from Cambodia nine years ago, had experi-enced a perplexing course over many years of recur-rent fever and abdominal pain, notably localized inthe left upper quadrant. Although the early episodesof abdominal pain were not associated with spleno-megaly, on more recent physical examinations over a17-month period the spleen was found to increase insize. At this point I shall ask Dr. Mueller to review theavailable radiologic studies.DR. PETER R. MUELLER: A posteroanterior x-rayfilm of the chest is normal except for the shrapnel inthe soft tissues overlying the left axilla. The left hemi-diaphragm is slightly elevated, as is consistent withthe enlarged spleen. No parenchymal abnormalitiesare seen. The CT scan (Fig. 1) demonstrates enlarge-ment of the spleen with slight displacement of thestomach. Several areas of calcification are visiblewithin the spleen. Lateral to the spleen there is an areaof low density. A contrast-enhanced image reveals en-hancement at the periphery of this abnormality, sug-gesting a capsule. Other CT images show smaller low-density areas within the spleen.DR.

All rights reserved.Vol. 327 No. 15CASE RECORDS OF THE MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL1083multiple abscesses, both within the spleen and pos-sibly in a subcapsular or contiguous extrasplenic lo-cation.Thus, we must account for a disease that causessplenomegaly, with apparent splenic and perisplenicabscesses, and that has a prolonged course. It is possi-ble that the three-month illness 14 years ago was theinitial episode that culminated in these findings in theleft upper quadrant. In evaluating the patient\\'s recentproblem I shall consider infectious causes of a diseasethat in all likelihood had been present for at least eightyears and probably was acquired while the patientwas in his native Cambodia.Keeping in mind the predominantly left-upper-quadrant findings and the chronic, recrudescent yetprogressive course of this patient\\'s illness, I shall firstconsider infectious diseases that might have been ac-quired over a decade earlier in Southeast Asia andhave the potential to persist.Several protozoan infections can involve the spleenand have a chronic course. Visceral leishmaniasis in-volves the reticuloendothelial cells of the spleen butdoes not cause multifocal intrasplenic and perisplenicabscesses, as observed in this patient. Longstandingmalaria causes tropical splenomegaly, which is preva-lent in malarious areas, especially Papua New Guineaand central Africa, and improves with antimalarialtherapy. The splenic enlargement in tropical spleno-megaly is diffuse, resulting in hypersplenism, but thefocal lesions found on imaging in this case are notseen. Although the patient was from a region endemicfor falciparum malaria and had a positive serologictest for P. falciparum, his splenic disease is not compati-ble with malaria.Another protozoan infection, chronic amebiasis,may take two forms — chronic nondysenteric colitis,which can worsen many years after the onset of infec-tion or when corticosteroids are administered, andcolonic ameboma, a granulomatous mass lesion. Boththese lesions are colonic and would not predominantlyinvolve the spleen. Amebic abscesses can occur in vir-tually any organ but are most common in the liver,and multiple intrasplenic and perisplenic abscesseswould be unusual.One helminthic infection that can cause longstand-ing involvement of the spleen is schistosomiasis. Em-bolization of eggs into presinusoidal vessels in the liverleads to the development of portal hypertension andconsequent splenomegaly. Although schistosomiasis,due principally to Schistosoma mekongi, is present in re-gions of Southeast Asia, this patient had no evidenceof hepatomegaly or portal hypertension. Splenic in-volvement in schistosomiasis would not account forhis recrudescing febrile illness with focal left-upper-quadrant pain.Another helminthic infection that can be slowlyprogressive and give rise only episodically to clinicalfindings is echinococcosis, which produces cystic masslesions. Patients with echinococcosis have lesions mostoften in the liver and less commonly in the lungs, butvirtually any organ, including the spleen and bone,may be involved. The imaging studies, however,would show characteristic, well-defined cystic lesions.The symptoms are usually due to mass effects of slow-ly enlarging cysts and occasionally are due to ruptureand leakage of cyst contents. Episodic leakage cancause fever, transient increases in eosinophilia, andrarely anaphylaxis. This patient\\'s recurrent episodesof fever and abdominal pain are not typical of echino-coccosis, no eosinophilia was noted, and the findingson the imaging studies are not compatible with thecystic lesions of echinococcosis.Strongyloides stercoralis, with its notable capability forongoing internal autoinfection, causes an infectionthat can persist for many decades. In uncomplicatedstrongyloidiasis adult parasites reside in the proximalsmall intestine, and larvae may traverse the skin, thecolonic wall, and the lungs. If dissemination developsbecause of immunosuppression, larvae may migrateto any site. Focal chronic colitis can occur in strongy-loidiasis, but localized splenic or perisplenic collec-tions are not found.Thus, a persisting parasitic infection acquired inSoutheast Asia is not likely to account for this patient\\'sdisease, and I shall consider next chronic, nonpara-sitic infections. Chronic pyogenic abscesses can devel-op at the sites of foreign bodies. Routine radiographsof the chest had detected a metallic density, probablyshrapnel, but no metallic density was noted in thevarious imagings of his splenic area. If a foreign bodywas present as a focus for chronic infection, that singlesite would not account for the multiple intraspleniclesions.This patient came from an area where tuberculosisis widely prevalent, and he had a positive tuberculinskin test, both early and later in his course. Tuberculo-sis is a common cause of splenic calcifications, andthis patient had never received antituberculous thera-py. Radiographs of the chest provided no evidence ofactive or inactive pulmonary tuberculosis, but chronic“cold” tuberculous abscesses can develop in extrapul-monary sites. Although it is difficult to exclude tuber-culosis as the cause of this patient\\'s infection withcertainty, the characteristics of the splenic abscessesare not suggestive of chronic tuberculous abscesses.A bacterial infection that can be chronic and involvethe spleen with suppuration is brucellosis, which isworldwide in its distribution and can be acquired bydirect contact, by consumption of contaminated meator milk products, or by inhalation. Various brucellaspecies infect animals, including cattle, goats, andswine, with Brucella suis from swine most likely to causelate suppurative complications in human beings. Bru-cellae localize within the reticuloendothelial system,and their presence can lead to calcified splenic lesions,which may continue to harbor viable bacteria. Acutebrucellosis might account for this patient\\'s history of athree-month febrile illness in his native Cambodia,and the persistence of viable brucellae within thespleen and episodes of focal splenic suppuration couldThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

The chronicity of the illness,with periods of well-being punctuated by fever andleft-upper-quadrant pain due to splenic suppuration,is compatible with chronic brucellosis. Similar pat-terns of chronic brucellosis with splenic suppuration,often due to longstanding infection with B. suis, havebeen documented. 2-7 The absence of positive bloodcultures for brucellae is typical of chronic brucellosis,in which the diagnosis can be made by culturing theorganisms from sites of suppuration or at times fromother reticuloendothelial sites, such as the bone mar-row, or by serologic tests. Almost all patients withchronic brucellosis are seropositive. Agglutination re-actions detect antibodies to all species of pathogenicbrucella except B. canis, but caution must be exercisedin interpreting serologic tests for brucella since at lowdilutions serum from patients with chronic brucellosismay appear to be negative. We are told that an agglu-tination test was negative for brucella, but one wouldwant to know whether the serum had been tested afterdilution to overcome a possible false negative prozonephenomenon. If the serum had been diluted ade-quately and the test remained negative, brucellosiswould be unlikely. Otherwise, chronic brucellosis withrecurrences of splenic suppuration would remain anentity that requires consideration. Because brucellosisis not rapidly cured by currently available antimicro-bial agents, splenectomy and drainage of abscess fluidare needed to expedite recovery.2Finally, an unusual pathogen, Pseudomonas pseudo-mallei, causing melioidosis, must be considered in thiscase. Although P. pseudomallei can be found in manyareas of the world, it is especially common in South-east Asia, where it is present in soil and water, includ-ing streams and rice paddies, and on market produce.Infection is acquired by direct inoculation of woundsand probably by inhalation and ingestion. Most casesof melioidosis have been encountered in residents ofSoutheast Asia or in those who have lived or worked inthat region. Melioidosis can be inapparent clinically,but in patients in whom illness develops three clinicalpresentations are recognized. Acute melioidosis canproduce infection at local cutaneous sites, acute pneu-monitis, or septicemia, which may be fulminant andcomplicated by visceral abscess formation. In sub-acute melioidosis, latent infection is reactivated manyyears after the initial exposure, producing recrudes-cent disease that often involves the lungs, where it maysimulate tuberculosis. Finally, melioidosis may bechronic, with longstanding suppurative abscesses in-volving numerous anatomical sites. It is this form ofmelioidosis that I would seriously consider in this pa-tient. I suspect that he acquired melioidosis in South-east Asia and that his initial three-month febrile illnessin Cambodia was acute melioidosis that subsidedwithout benefit of antimicrobial therapy. The authorsof a recent study from Thailand evaluating liver ab-scesses due to P. pseudomallei noted that althoughsplenic abscesses were rare in patients with pyogenicliver abscesses due to other organisms, over half thepatients with liver abscesses due to melioidosis alsohad splenic abscesses, often with a multiplicity of hy-poechoic areas demonstrable on splenic ultrasono-graphic examination. There is not an extensive litera-ture on human melioidosis, but splenic abscesses havebeen reported several times, even when other ana-tomical sites were predominantly involved at the timeof presentation. 10-15 In former residents of SoutheastAsia, reactivation of melioidosis can occur years afterthey have left the region, 16 and splenic abscesses due tomelioidosis, along with involvement in other sites,have developed several years10 and even over a dec-ade¹5 after emigration. Therefore, as in brucellosis, es-pecially when due to B. suis, the spleen is a likely site oflocalization for P. pseudomallei. Residual splenic foci ofinfection can lead to chronic suppuration at sites with-in or contiguous to the spleen, as well as provide afocus for subsequent dissemination to other sites. Inone reported case of melioidosis, 13 suppuration devel-oped at a venipuncture site in the antecubital fossa,and we might even speculate that in this patient thefuruncle in the antecubital fossa noted on an earlieradmission arose from local seeding with hematoge-nously disseminated P. pseudomallei.13Thus, in view of this patient\\'s history of emigratingfrom Cambodia after a febrile illness 14 years earlier, Ibelieve that melioidosis with residual splenic foci ofinfection led to the formation of abscesses within thespleen and contiguous to it. Over the past five to sevenyears these abscesses provoked episodes of fever andleft-upper-quadrant pain. Although many of theseclinical episodes appeared self-limited, chronic infec-tion with P. pseudomallei within the spleen persisted,with some sites becoming calcified and other sites de-veloping into abscesses and perisplenic suppuration.P. pseudomallei is usually resistant to gentamicin, whichwas administered to this patient. Antimicrobial thera-py of melioidosis has historically been fraught withuncertainty and failure.¹\" Clinical responses have notbeen uniformly predictable from in vitro antibiot-ic susceptibility testing. For treatment of acute sep-ticemic melioidosis, antimicrobial therapy has oftenconsisted of combinations of agents, such as chlor-amphenicol, doxycycline, trimethoprim, and sulfa-methoxazole, but even with such combinations themortality of the disease has remained extraordinarilyhigh. 18 The use of the third-generation cephalosporinceftazidime has improved markedly the survival ofpatients with acute melioidosis. 18 Further clinical ex-perience is needed to establish antimicrobial regimensfor acute melioidosis and relapsing melioidosis thatwill not be complicated by the development of antimi-crobial resistance during therapy or by clinical re-lapses after discontinuance of antimicrobial therapy.Agents such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and imi-penem may have roles.In this patient the diagnosis was presumably madeby obtaining abscess fluid for culture and Gram stain-ing, although P. pseudomallei may be few in numberand difficult to visualize on Gram stains.

In this patient, inview of the multitude of intrasplenic lesions, the large,possibly subcapsular, loculated collection of fluid, andthe refractoriness of the probable bacterial pathogensto antimicrobial therapy splenectomy and drainagenot only would have provided material for the diagno-sis but also would have contributed to the therapy ofthis longstanding splenic infection.DR. EUGENE J. MARK: Dr. Ryan, do you have anycomments?Dr. Edward T. RYAN: I saw the patient for theInfectious Disease Unit with Dr. Stephen Calder-wood. At the first presentation we shared the differen-tial diagnosis that Dr. Weller has enumerated. Onepossibility that came to mind was recrudescent malar-ia. We waited for the results of serologic testing andtreated the patient empirically with chloroquine phos-phate. He seemed to improve with resolution of all thesymptoms. He returned to work and was eating welland feeling well. Specimens for serologic tests weresent to the Centers for Disease Control, and the resultsdid not return for approximately six weeks, at whichtime we knew that we had not obtained the diagnosis.Shortly thereafter the patient\\'s symptoms recurred,and we performed the diagnostic procedure.CLINICAL DIAGNOSES? Splenic abscesses, due to mycobacteria or otherbacteria.? Splenic lymphoma.? Splenic infarction.DR. PETER F. WELLER\\'S DIAGNOSISSplenic melioidosis.PATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONDr. G. RICHARD DICKERSIN: The diagnostic proce-dure was a needle biopsy of the spleen. Smears and acell block of the aspirate showed only necrotic de-bris. Stains for bacteria and fungi were negative. Cul-tures of the aspirate were negative for mycobacteriaand fungi but positive for the gram-negative bacillusP. pseudomallei, confirming the diagnosis of chronicmelioidosis. Dr. Ryan, will you tell us about the pa-tient\\'s subsequent course?DR. RYAN: Once the cultures began to grow a non-enteric gram-negative rod the patient was given cefta-zidime and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for treat-ment of melioidosis. His symptoms improved greatly,and his fever resolved. However, severe discomfort inthe left upper quadrant persisted. Our hope was toavoid splenectomy, since the lesion had an adequateblood supply and there were no areas of liquefaction.The patient was therefore given appropriate antibiot-ics intravenously for seven days. Unfortunately, theprocess did not resolve, and we recommended a sple-nectomy. Despite the high doses of antibiotics for sev-en days, cultures of specimens obtained at splenecto-my grew out P. pseudomallei within 24 hours.The original isolate was resistant to amikacin, gen-tamicin, ticarcillin, and tobramycin and had an inter-mediate response to ciprofloxacin; it was sensitive tochloramphenicol, imipenem, mezlocillin, piperacillin,and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The second iso-late showed the development of resistance to chloram-phenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. It wassensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The other re-sistance patterns remained the same.DR. DICKERSIN: The excised spleen was enlarged,weighing 480 g and measuring 14 by 13 by 10 cm. Anirregular, ragged defect, 5 by 4.2 cm, on the anterome-dial surface extended 0.6 cm into the parenchyma.Adjacent to the hilus there was a round, yellow, firmnodule, 0.6 cm, that did not extend into the parenchy-ma. Numerous shaggy, brown-red adhesions coveredthe splenic surface. Examination of the cut surfaces(Fig. 2) revealed numerous well-circumscribed, protu-berant, yellow, friable nodules, 0.4 to 1.6 cm in diame-ter, surrounded by rims of delicate, tan fibrous tissue.Four subcapsular, blood-filled, thin-walled pockets,less than 1.6 cm in diameter, were also present.Microscopical examination revealed that the sur-face defect and parenchymal nodules were granuloma-tous (Fig. 3). The centers of most of the granulomaswere composed of necrotic debris rimmed by neutro-phils (Fig. 4). In some granulomas there was a periph-eral layer of epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleatedgiant cells (Fig. 3). Thick fibrous tissue with abundanthemosiderin pigment surrounded occasional granulo-mas, and some granulomas were completely fibrotic(Fig. 5), with or without focal calcification. No micro-organisms were found on special stains.Melioidosis was first described in Rangoon byWhitmore and Krishnaswami¹º in 1912 and until re-cently was thought to be rare.

Splenic Granuloma with Central Necrosis (Right)(×100).fairly common in Southeast Asia; P. pseudomallei wascultured from the blood of 63 of 269 patients (23percent) presenting with septicemia in a hospital innortheast Thailand. 20 Many of the patients had abra-sions of their feet, and at least 18 patients had blood-borne pneumonia.Although the route of infection of melioidosis ismost often through the skin, it can also be through therespiratory tract. The bacterium may lie dormant inan infected person for long periods and then becomereactivated and produce clinically evident disease, 16,21The longest interval between exposure and clinicaldisease on record is 26 years.22 It has been estimatedthat 225,000 United States veterans of the VietnamWar have subclinical melioidosis, on the basis of highhemagglutination titers to P. pseudomallei in 1 to 2 per-cent of those who served in areas where the disorder isFigure 4.

The bacteria are present in smears of abscesscontents but are very small and may not be detectedon microscopical examination. In addition, when bac-teria are found, they may be misinterpreted as other,more common pseudomonas species. The P. pseudomal-lei bacterium is a motile, obligately aerobic and non-spore-forming bacillus. It shows bipolar staining onculture media. 17 The histologic features of melioidosiswere reported in detail from the Armed Forces Insti-tute of Pathology in 1970 in a study at autopsy of 16cases in which the diagnosis was proved by antemor-tem cultures.23 Ten patients had had acute diseaseclinically, with the length of illness before death rang-ing from 3 to 42 days. Six of the 16 patients present-ed with chronic disease, ranging in duration from3 months to 15 years. None of these patients died oftheir disease, which was associated with localized, lesssevere signs and symptoms. The diagnosis was madeFigure 5.

       " 'A 60-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of chronic diarrhea and increasing weakness.\\nThe patient was in stable health until eight months earlier, when diarrhea developed while he was working in Mexico. A test for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 was positive. He returned to this country. Seven and a half months before entry he noticed weakness of the right leg and clumsiness of the right arm. One month later he came to this hospital, where physical examination revealed spastic paresis of the right leg. A cranial computed tomographic (CT) scan showed evidence of an infarct in the left posterofrontal cortex in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery. Noninvasive carotid studies revealed occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, severe stenosis of the right internal carotid artery, and stenosis of the right external carotid artery. A complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and blood chemical levels were normal, except that the albumin was 2.9 g per 100 ml (29 g per liter). A test for HIV antibodies was positive, as were tests for hepatitis B surface antibodies and cytomegalovirus antibodies; tests for the hepatitis B surface antigen, toxoplasma antibodies, and the p24 antigen and a serologic test for syphilis were negative. The CD4+ cell count was 253 per cubic millimeter. A tuberculin skin test (5 TU) was negative, and a skin test with candida antigen was positive. Stool examinations for ova and parasites were negative, and stool cultures yielded no pathogenic microorganisms.\\nSix months before admission the patient had tonic-clonic seizures of the left arm and leg and was admitted to the hospital. A percutaneous cerebral angiographic examination disclosed that the left internal carotid artery was occluded at its origin; there was severe stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery. A right carotid endarterectomy was performed. The patient was discharged on the 11th hospital day, receiving aspirin and phenytoin sodium.\\nThe patient returned to Mexico. Eight weeks before admission, intermittent diarrhea became more frequent, watery, and voluminous. His weight declined further, accompanied by anorexia, dysphagia, and odynophagia. He did not experience abdominal pain or cramps, hematochezia, fever, chills, or sweats. He returned to this country to undergo further evaluation. Microscopical examination of a biopsy specimen of the colon disclosed patchy active colitis, with cryptitis. The diarrhea worsened, and two weeks before admission he became too weak to walk. He was readmitted to the hospital.\\nThe patient led a bisexual lifestyle. He had lost 27 kg in weight during his illness. There was no history of intravenous drug abuse, documented opportunistic infections, Kaposi\\'s sarcoma, hyperlipidemia, or coronary artery disease, and no family history of inflammatory bowel disease.\\nThe temperature was 37°C, the pulse was 97, and the respirations were 22. The blood pressure was 95/75 mm Hg when the patient was in the supine position.\\nPhysical examination revealed cachexia, dehydration, and weakness. There was no rash or lymphadenopathy. Diffuse rhonchi were heard in both lungs. The heart was normal. The abdomen was soft and nontender, with hypoactive bowel sounds; no organs or masses were felt. There was ++ edema of the ankles, with symmetric wasting of the extremities.\\nThe urine was normal. The hematocrit was 31 percent; the white-cell count was 6400 (6.4×10º per liter), with 76 percent neutrophils, 2 percent band forms, 19 percent lymphocytes, 1 percent atypical lymphocytes, and 2 percent monocytes. The mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were normal. The platelet count, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, prothrombin time, and partial-thromboplastin time were normal. The urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, bilirubin, uric acid, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, and alanine aminotransferase were normal. Other laboratory values are listed in Table 1. The phenytoin level was 21 µg per milliliter (83 µmol per liter). An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 92, with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities and low voltage in all leads. X-ray films of the chest and an x-ray film of the abdomen were normal.\\nPhenytoin sodium was continued, heparin was injected subcutaneously, fluids were administered intravenously, parenteral nutrition was begun, and fluconazole and loperamide were given by mouth. The diarrhea waxed and waned; repeated stool cultures yielded no pathogenic microorganisms. Examination with a fiberoptic esophagogastroduodenoscope showed a few white plaques in the esophagus. Microscopical examination of a biopsy specimen showed acute esophagitis with ulceration; no evidence of fungal or viral infection was detected; examination of a specimen from the duodenum revealed chronic duodenitis, without villous blunting; no giardia, cryptosporidia, or viral inclusions were identified. On the sixth hospital day another x-ray film of the chest showed bilateral pleural effusions and opacification in the retrocardiac region. Gentamicin was begun.\\nOn the eighth hospital day the patient was in respiratory distress. The temperature was 37.3°C, the pulse 152, and the respirations 40; the blood pressure was 110/90 mm Hg. Inspiratory crackles were heard over both lungs, with diminished breath sounds on the right side. The pulmonary laboratory findings are listed in Table 2. An x-ray film of the chest (Fig. 1) revealed an increase in the right pleural effusion; the cardiac borders were partially obscured, but the heart was not enlarged; pulmonary interstitial markings were more prominent. Several hours later the blood pressure fell to 95 mm Hg systolic. An endotracheal tube was inserted, assisted ventilation was begun, and the patient was transferred to an intensive care unit. Transfusions of packed red cells were given. Multiple stool specimens gave negative tests for occult blood. Other laboratory values are listed in Table 1. A rightsided thoracentesis yielded 1000 ml of serosanguineous fluid that contained 3944 red cells and 3633 white cells per cubic millimeter, of which 88 percent were neutrophils; the pH was 7.10; the protein was 1.2 g per 100 ml (12 g per liter), and the glucose 187 mg per 100 ml (10.4 mmol per liter); the lactic dehydrogenase was 417 U, and the amylase 43 U per liter; microscopical examination of stained specimens disclosed no acidfast bacilli, fungi, or other microorganisms or malignant-tumor cells. An ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen revealed dilatation of the hepatic veins and inferior vena cava, increased echogenicity of the liver, ascitic fluid, bilateral pleural effusions, and a small pericardial effusion. That evening two brief bouts of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurred. A central venous pressure catheter and a pulmonary arterial line were inserted, and a nasogastric tube was passed. While the patient was receiving infusions of norepinephrine and dobutamine by vein and the systolic arterial pressure was 95 mm Hg, the central venous pressure ranged from 8 to 14 mm Hg, the right ventricular pressure was 37/8 mm Hg, the pulmonary arterial pressure was 35/25 mm Hg, and the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was 24 mm Hg, with V waves. The cardiac output was 2.7 liters per minute, and the cardiac index 1.6 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area. Culture of all specimens remained negative. Tests on the serum for cryptococcal and amebic antibodies were negative; a stool assay for Clostridium difficile toxin was negative. On the ninth hospital day an electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at a rate of 133, with slightly lower voltage and minor changes in the nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. A radiograph of the chest revealed bilateral perihilar air-space disease consistent with pneumonia or pulmonary edema, with a decrease in the right pleural effusion; the heart size was unchanged. A cardiac ultrasonographic examination disclosed slight dilatation of the left atrium, with minimal mitral regurgitation by Doppler examination; the aortic cusps were thickened, without stenosis; there was global and segmental left ventricular dysfunction, with hypokinesis of the septum, the anterior wall at the base, the inferior and posterior walls at the midportion of the ventricle, and all segments at the apex and akinesis at the midventricular level; the left ventricular systolic ejection fraction was 39 percent; minimal tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonic regurgitation were detected by Doppler examination; the right ventricle was dilated, with marked diffuse hypokinesis and severe impairment of systolic function; a small pericardial effusion was visible. Other laboratory values are listed in Table 1. The temperature did not exceed 38.2°C on either day.\\nOn the 10th hospital day the patient required a continuous intravenous infusion of dobutamine while receiving nitroglycerin by vein; the systolic pressure ranged between 90 and 100 mm Hg on most occasions. During the day he had several bouts of pulmonary edema. Another electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 149, without other important change. An x-ray film of the chest revealed recurrence of the large right pleural effusion; the left pleural effusion was unchanged. A gated blood-pool study, performed after the intravenous injection of 99mTc-labeled human serum albumin, revealed slight prominence of the right atrium, with normal contractions; the right ventricle was moderately enlarged, with severe, diffuse hypokinesis; the right ventricular ejection fraction was 21 percent; the left atrium was normal; the left ventricle was normal in size, with severe, diffuse hypokinesis; the left ventricular ejection fraction was 23 percent. A resting thallium scan, obtained 15 minutes after the intravenous injection of 201T1 and again two hours later, revealed that the right ventricle was enlarged and the left ventricle was normal in size; the thallium distribution in the myocardium was normal, without evidence of ischemia or infarction. On the following day the patient was afebrile. While unobserved, he removed the endotracheal tube. Other laboratory values are listed in Table 1. Another rightsided thoracentesis yielded 1100 ml of turbid, brownish fluid that contained 2200 white cells per cubic millimeter (2.2×10º per liter), of which 91 percent were neutrophils; there were no microorganisms or malignant-tumor cells, and a culture specimen was sterile. Another x-ray film of the chest revealed no change in the pleural effusions; patchy air-space disease was present at both lung bases; the heart was unchanged. The patient was weaned from dobutamine and was able to tolerate injections of enalapril by vein.\\nOn the 12th hospital day the temperature rose to 38.6°C. Physical examination of the lungs showed no change. A summation gallop was heard over the precordium. The hematocrit was 36.9 percent; the whitecell count was 12,900 (12.9×10º per liter), with 86 percent neutrophils; the platelet count was 259,000 (259×10º per liter). The hematocrit remained relatively constant on all subsequent days, and the whitecell count did not exceed 11,600 (11.6×10º per liter) thereafter. The total bilirubin remained normal. The right atrial pressure was 30/20 mm Hg, the right ventricular pressure 55/30 mm Hg, the pulmonary arterial pressure 60/40 mm Hg, and the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure 40 mm Hg.\\nIn the early hours of the next day respiratory failure recurred, and the trachea was again intubated. Another electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 111, without other important changes. The temperature rose to 39°C and ranged as high as 38.3°C on all subsequent days. On the 14th hospital day the patient was temporarily weaned from dobutamine. A culture of sputum yielded abundant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gentamicin was discontinued, and clindamycin and ceftazidime were begun. On the 16th hospital day hypotension recurred, and oxymetazoline was infused. On the 18th hospital day he was weaker. Repeated electrocardiograms showed sinus tachycardia at varying rates, without other changes.\\nThe patient died on the 21st hospital day.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. HOWARD M. HELLER*: In this 60-year-old man who was infected with HIV the CD4 lymphocytes were already substantially depleted, with the absolute count at 253 cells per cubic millimeter, but he still was able to manifest intact cell-mediated immunity to cutaneous antigen testing. There was a recent history of cerebral infarction associated with carotid-artery occlusion. He was admitted to the hospital because of weight loss and recurrent severe diarrhea of eight months\\' duration. Shortly after admission, signs of heart failure developed, and less than two weeks later he died.\\nDr. Palmer, will you show us some of the radiographs and nuclear studies?\\nDR. EDWIN L. PALMER: An x-ray film of the abdomen obtained on admission is normal, and a radiograph of the chest shows evidence of obstructive pulmonary disease but is otherwise normal. A film of the chest taken on the sixth hospital day reveals bilateral pleural effusions, which were larger on the right side. A film taken two days later shows an increase in size of the pleural effusions as well as a diffuse pulmonary abnormality (Fig. 1). A film obtained after a rightsided thoracentesis, with removal of much of the fluid, demonstrates a diffuse bilateral pulmonary abnormality, consistent with either edema or pneumonia. The last film, obtained two days thereafter, shows reaccumulation of the right pleural effusion.\\nIn the resting thallium study, images obtained at injection and three hours later demonstrate no abnormality of the left ventricle. Selected images from a gated cardiac blood-pool scan show dilatation and hypokinesis of the right ventricle; the left ventricle was slightly dilated, with diffuse hypokinesis, and there was a regional abnormality of the mid-anterolateral wall. Left ventricular function was substantially reduced, with an ejection fraction of 23 percent.\\nDR. HELLER: I shall focus my discussion on the cardiac disease and the recurrent severe diarrhea and attempt to arrive at a unifying diagnosis.\\nThis patient had severe global cardiac dysfunction, demonstrated on both the echocardiographic study and the gated blood-pool study. In view of the normal myocardial uptake in the resting thallium test, it is unlikely that the cardiac dysfunction was due to myocardial infarction. An infarct severe enough to cause this degree of dysfunction would probably have caused a much higher elevation of the creatine kinase (CK-MB). The elevation of the CK-MB, however, does suggest the presence of active myocarditis.\\nIn patients with HIV infection, cardiac abnormalities are relatively common. 1-4 Ventricular hypokinesis is found in up to 41 percent of patients with end-stage HIV infection, 5-9 although usually it is not clinically apparent. Although myocardial disease has been associated with a variety of opportunistic pathogens, a causal relation may be difficult to establish.\\nIn patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) Toxoplasma gondii is associated most commonly with infection of the central nervous system, but it has also been accompanied rarely by myocarditis. 10 In one autopsy series,\" which included a large proportion of Haitian patients, toxoplasma tachyzoites were identified within the myocardium in 35 percent of the patients who had myocarditis with lymphocytic infiltrates. In another series of 14 patients in which toxoplasmosis was present at autopsy, 12 myocarditis was found in 1 patient and T. gondii cysts were seen in the myocardium. It is difficult to establish a causal relation, since at times T. gondii tachyzoites are identified in the myocardium in the absence of evidence of myocarditis. 13 Since the serologic test for toxoplasma was negative in this case, it is unlikely that the myocarditis was due to this organism.\\nInfection due to Cryptococcus neoformans presents most often with signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis in patients with AIDS. Fulminant disseminated cryptococcosis can cause myocarditis with myocardial depression, 14,15 and at autopsy numerous cryptococci can be seen in the myocardium, at times without an inflammatory response. Cryptococcal antigen is usually present in a high titer in the serum of patients with fulminant disease, and therefore that infection is easy to diagnose. Cryptococcal myocarditis is very improbable in this patient, since the blood culture and the assay for cryptococcal antigen in the serum were negative and also since his CD4 lymphocyte count was higher than that usually seen in patients with AIDS and disseminated cryptococcosis.\\nMycobacterium tuberculosis can cause myocardial infection 16 but usually results principally in pericardial disease. In this case the absence of delayed hypersensitivity to purified protein derivative in the setting of an appropriate response to candida antigen makes active tuberculous infection unlikely.\\nThe most common infectious causes of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy in the general population are the group B coxsackieviruses. In patients with HIV infection and myocarditis or cardiomyopathy, however, these viruses have been reported as pathogens only rarely.1\" The true frequency of coxsackievirus-associated cardiomyopathy may be underestimated, however, since coxsackievirus infections are usually diagnosed by an acute rise in the antibody titer and serologic tests are often unreliable in patients with HIV infection.\\nCytomegalovirus has been associated with cardiac disease in patients with and without HIV infection. 18,19 The identification of this virus as a pathogen is generally made by the finding of cytomegalic inclusion bodies. The importance of identifying these inclusion bodies in the tissue is not always clear, however, since at times they are found even in the absence of clinically evident disease. Also, in some patients the cytomegalovirus genome can be detected in tissue with DNA hybridization techniques in the absence of cytomegalic inclusion bodies. 20 In one autopsy series, 21 evidence of myocarditis with cytomegalovirus inclusions was present in 4 of 56 patients with AIDS. Cytomegalovirus myocarditis, however, is usually found in patients who have concurrent cytomegalovirus disease in other organs. Although most patients with HIV infection are also seropositive for cytomegalovirus, the disease generally does not occur unless the CD4 count falls below 100 cells per cubic millimeter. Therefore, although the serologic test for cytomegalovirus was positive in this case, it is unlikely that it was the cause of the myocarditis.\\nAlthough myocarditis is rarely confirmed histologically ante mortem in patients with HIV infection, 22 it is a very common finding at autopsy in patients with AIDS,23,24 and in most of the cases a pathogenic opportunistic infectious agent cannot be identified. The typical histopathological picture is that of a focal lymphocytic myocarditis. The lymphocytic infiltrates are not always associated with myocardial-cell necrosis. Some evidence suggests that the idiopathic lymphocytic myocarditis is due to HIV itself. With use of in situ DNA hybridization techniques, the HIV genome has been detected in the myocardium of patients with AIDS. 25 The presence of detectable HIV genome does not always correlate, however, with evidence of myocarditis and an inflammatory infiltrate. Cardiac myocyte abnormalities have been noted in the absence of inflammatory infiltrates, 26,27 suggesting that HIV may exert either a direct toxic effect on myocytes or an indirect effect by inducing the production of cardiotoxic cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor.\\nIn the case under discussion I believe that the cause of the patient\\'s cardiac dysfunction was HIV-related myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, but the severe cardiac dysfunction despite the minimal signs of ventricular enlargement on radiologic studies requires explanation. As in the other forms of viral myocarditis, such as those due to coxsackievirus and cytomegalovirus, HIV cardiomyopathy is reported to be typically associated with marked cardiac dilatation. Although cardiac dysfunction occurs often in patients with HIV infection, it usually does not cause clinically evident disease until the heart begins to enlarge.\\nVan Hoeven et al. 28 found that HIV-infected patients with other risk factors for heart disease were more likely to have cardiac abnormalities at autopsy than those without risk factors for heart disease, and emphasized the importance of looking at other risk factors when evaluating cardiac dysfunction in patients with AIDS. The patient under discussion had evidence of severe atherosclerosis and was relatively old for a patient with AIDS. In recent years only about 3 percent of patients with AIDS reported to the Centers for Disease Control have been over the age of 60 years. 29 It is probable that this patient also had coronary artery disease, and it is possible that it caused the HIV myocarditis to have such a devastating effect on the cardiac function, although marked cardiac dilatation as a result of cardiomyopathy had not yet occurred.\\nNow I shall return to the chronic, recurrent, watery diarrhea that led the patient to come to the hospital, to see whether I can tie it to the cardiac problem and make a unifying diagnosis.\\nDiarrhea is common in patients with HIV infection. This patient\\'s diarrhea was watery, had a waxingand-waning course, and probably caused severe malabsorption that resulted in his substantial weight loss. There was a notable absence of abdominal symptoms. It is improbable that he had a common bacterial pathogen, such as salmonella, shigella, or helicobacter, since these organisms are fairly easy to isolate in culture and are usually associated with fever and some degree of abdominal discomfort.\\nCytomegalovirus can cause gastrointestinal infection in patients with AIDS. Although this virus can result in disease in any part of the alimentary tract, it most commonly causes disease in the colon and often is associated with abdominal pain and fever. Cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies are usually readily seen in biopsy specimens, and none were detected in the many biopsy specimens obtained in this case. Cytomegalovirus organ disease in patients with AIDS, whether it is retinitis, adrenalitis, pneumonitis, or alimentary-tract disease, almost always happens when the CD4 count is under 100 cells per cubic millimeter. Adenovirus-associated colitis in patients with AIDS is associated with a chronic, watery, nonbloody, nonmucoid diarrhea, but the histopathological description is not similar to that given in this case. Adenovirus-associated colitis affects principally mucosal cells, and intranuclear inclusions are seen in the infected cells. 30\\nM. avium complex is a common pathogen in patients with AIDS, but when it is the cause of severe diarrhea, acid-fast bacilli are usually seen in intestinal biopsy specimens as well as in the stool. Like other opportunistic pathogens, M. avium complex typically causes disease in patients with CD4 counts much lower than the count in this patient.\\nIsospora belli is associated with the type of persistent watery diarrhea that this patient had, and with his history of frequent travel to Mexico he might have been at a somewhat higher risk for infection with this organism. Isospora, however, is usually readily identified on Kinyoun or Ziehl-Neelsen staining of stool, which presumably was part of his stool evaluation. Other parasitic enteric infections, such as giardiasis and amebiasis, do occur in patients with HIV infection, but the organisms usually can be identified in the stool or certainly in duodenal or colonic biopsy specimens.\\nCryptosporidium species is a common cause of persistent or recurrent watery diarrhea in patients with AIDS31 as well as in immunocompetent persons in Central and South America, 32,33 and this patient\\'s frequent travel to Mexico could have made him more likely to acquire this infection. In patients with AIDS it can involve the biliary tract, the small bowel, or the colon. Repeated examinations of stool are often needed to detect cryptosporidia. Since they were not seen in the stool specimens or in the biopsy specimens taken from the small and large bowel, cryptosporidiosis is unlikely in this case.\\nOver the past few years microsporidiosis caused by Enterocytozoon bieneusi has been identified as a common cause of severe watery diarrhea and malabsorption in patients with HIV infection. 34,35 The diagnosis of microsporidiosis can be elusive, because it is difficult to identify spores in the stool.36 Since the organism affects mainly the jejunum, the diagnosis is made most readily by histologic examination of a biopsy specimen of the distal portion of the duodenum. Although this patient\\'s clinical picture is compatible with microsporidiosis and he did not undergo diagnostic procedures to assess this possibility optimally, I prefer to try to connect the gastrointestinal disease with his heart disease.\\nHIV-associated enteropathy is a well-described condition characterized by persistent diarrhea and malabsorption in patients with HIV infection and no other identifiable pathogen. 30,37,38 The typical findings are similar to those described in this patient. The patients usually have signs of chronic gastrointestinal inflammation with partial villous atrophy. It is unclear whether the inflammation is a direct effect of the HIV, the effect of HIV-induced cytokines on the mucosa, or the result of HIV-induced alterations in mucosal immunity that allow bacterial overgrowth. 30\\nIn summary, this patient had some of the protean manifestations of HIV disease, which may be directly due to the multisystem involvement with HIV infection. The multiorgan involvement of HIV infection, the secrets of which have yet to be unraveled completely, validates the updated aphorism, \"To know HIV is to know medicine.\" My final diagnoses are HIV-1 myocarditis and cardiomyopathy with HIV-1-associated enteropathy.\\nDR. JOON LEE: How do you account for the pleural effusion?\\nDR. HELLER: The relatively high protein level and the high LDH level suggest that it was an exudate. It was more exudative than would have been expected if it was due to the congestive heart failure, unless diuresis had been induced before the thoracentesis. Although the pleural-fluid pH on the first thoracentesis was low at 7.1, we are not given the arterial pH and cannot be certain of its importance. The low pH, the exudative characteristics of the fluid, and the predominance of neutrophils are very suggestive of a bacterial infection, but with negative cultures from two consecutive specimens a bacterial empyema was unlikely.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus type 1 myocarditis.\\nDR. HOWARD M. HELLER\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus type 1 myocarditis and cardiomyopathy.\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus type 1-associated enteropathy.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. JAMES F. SOUTHERN: Despite multiple attempts to clear the patient\\'s exudative effusion, he continued to have respiratory failure. He chose to stop all treatment, he was extubated, and he died shortly thereafter.\\nThe autopsy revealed both myocarditis and atherosclerotic vascular disease causing diffuse coronary stenosis with a small subendocardial myocardial infarct. Other findings were approximately two weeks of age. Examination of the lungs showed bronchopneumonia and scattered small peripheral pulmonary emboli, most of which were organizing. Chronic active hepatitis, acute renal tubular necrosis, and a mild, nonspecific colitis without any recognizable infective agent were also found. The three main coronary arteries had areas of 75 to 80 percent stenosis. The left ventricle was moderately dilated, and the right ventricle was severely dilated. Away from the area of infarction, lymphocytes and eosinophils were scattered in the endocardium, myocardium, and epicardium with focal myocyte necrosis (Fig. 2 and 3). No viral inclusions, parasites, or bacteria, including mycobacteria, were identified; this was a patchy, mild lymphocytic myocarditis without obvious cause.\\nWould an endomyocardial biopsy have been helpful in the management of this patient\\'s care? Between 45 and 52 percent of patients with AIDS have had myocarditis at autopsy, and in many of these cases treatable infections have been identified. 23,26,39 The treatment of nonspecific lymphocytic myocarditis in patients with AIDS is still mostly anecdotal, with single case reports. Levy et al. 22 reported a 15-month survival in one of two patients treated by immunosuppressive therapy; the second patient died suddenly, although a repeated biopsy did not reveal ongoing myocarditis.\\nDR. HELLER: The issue of endomyocardial biopsy arises whenever we have a patient with AIDS who has cardiomyopathy. Although many of the causes of cardiomyopathy, including HIV lymphocytic myocarditis, are relatively treatable, I remain uncertain about the sensitivity of an endomyocardial biopsy in identifying the cause of cardiomyopathy in patients with HIV infection. I have seen some patients with cardiac toxoplasmosis and others with lymphocytic myocarditis that were not diagnosed by biopsy, perhaps because of the focal distribution of these diseases. What we need to know is the sensitivity of biopsy diagnosis as well as the predictive values of other factors, such as serologic examinations positive for T. gondii or cytomegalovirus viremia.',\n",
       " 'A 51-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with diffuse aches and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.\\nThe patient was well until 15 months earlier, when she began to experience pain in the shoulders, right arm, and legs with the onset of cold weather. She was seen in a hospital in her native Ethiopia, where injections were administered and oral medications were prescribed, without improvement. Six months before admission sweats developed and continued; the patient was uncertain about the presence of fever. One month later she found that her myalgias and arthralgias interfered with her sleep and were accompanied by fatigue, anorexia, a bifrontal headache, and chest pain that occurred when she ingested cold liquids or solids. She estimated that she had lost between 4.5 and 9 kg in weight. The pain was worse at night and affected the shoulders, neck, upper arms, upper back, and hips, and she had morning stiffness that persisted for approximately an hour.\\nThree months before admission, the patient came to the United States to visit her son and daughter. Her symptoms worsened, and three weeks later she came to this hospital. She had a cough only on ingesting cold foods and reported no abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, urinary symptoms, menstrual bleeding, impaired vision, diplopia, claudication of the jaw, rash, pruritus, or risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. She used no medications, tobacco, or alcohol. She believed that she had received vaccination with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) in childhood; her only surgical procedure was a cesarean section. The temperature was 35.1°C, and the pulse 91. The blood pressure was 135/75 mm Hg. The weight was 52.7 kg. General physical examination was negative except for a grade 1 systolic ejection murmur; the liver and spleen were not felt; muscle strength was normal; rectal examination was negative, and a stool specimen gave a negative test for occult blood. The urine gave a + test for protein and was normal otherwise. The urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, electrolytes, serum aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were normal. Additional laboratory findings on this admission and throughout the patient\\'s course are shown in Table 1. X-ray films of the chest (Fig. 1) showed low lung volumes with a slightly high right hemidiaphragm; the superior mediastinum was widened, with a suggestion of bilateral paratracheal lymphadenopathy; the cardiac silhouette appeared slightly full and was apparently accentuated by a poor inspiratory effort. A skin test with tuberculin (purified protein derivative [PPD], 5 tuberculin units) was positive, with 15 mm of induration, and a skin test with candida antigen was negative.\\nEight days later the patient was seen by a rheumatologist, who observed that the temporal arteries were not thickened or tender and found no rash or evidence of active arthritis; muscle strength and deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The urine was normal. The prothrombin time and partial-thromboplastin time were normal. Microscopical examination of a stool specimen revealed no ova or parasites. Serum immunoelectrophoresis disclosed that the IgG had a normal precipitin arc and a moderately increased concentration; the IgA and IgM showed normal precipitin arcs in normal concentrations. Agarose-gel electrophoresis revealed a normal pattern, with a moderate, diffuse increase in gamma globulins. A 24-hour prednisone test (15 mg) resulted in improvement in the symptoms, and daily doses of prednisone (12.5 mg) were continued during the succeeding six days.\\nFive days later the patient returned to the clinic, where she reported that her symptoms were slightly improved and that she had had no fever in the interval. Physical examination disclosed no abnormality except a grade 3 systolic murmur. The urine was normal. Repeated radiographs of the chest disclosed slight widening of the mediastinum and suggested slight enlargement of the cardiac silhouette; the lungs appeared clear. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest (Fig. 2) performed after the oral administration of contrast material showed prominent lymphadenopathy in the right paratracheal, pretracheal, precarinal, and subcarinal regions. Smaller lymph nodes were present in the retrosternal area, and there was slight thickening of the inferior portion of the pericardium. Calcification was observed in the region of the mitral valve. The lung parenchyma was clear, and no endobronchial lesions were observed; there were two or three hepatic cysts, the largest of which had a diameter of 1 cm. No retroperitoneal or retrocrural lymphadenopathy was seen. A test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:16 (speckled); a test for rheumatoid factor was negative. Two blood cultures and a culture of urine were negative. Microscopical examination of urine for schistosomes was negative.\\nThirteen days later the patient was seen in the oncology clinic. On physical examination her temperature was 36.7°C. Bilateral firm, rubbery axillary lymph nodes of 4 or 5 mm were palpated; no other change was found.\\nEight weeks before admission a right axillary lymph-node biopsy was nondiagnostic. A mediastinoscopic examination was scheduled but was postponed because of the patient\\'s inability to keep the appointment. She was subsequently admitted to the hospital.\\nPhysical examination was unchanged. The prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes were normal. An electrocardiogram revealed a normal rhythm at a rate of 82 with minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. MARK S. PASTERNACK: In summary, this middle-aged woman from Ethiopia had prolonged discomfort, stiffness of her shoulders, neck, arms, back, and hips, a profound weight loss, sweats, possible fever, and odynophagia. Laboratory studies demonstrated evidence of a chronic process, with anemia, hyperglobulinemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Her symptoms led to a trial of prednisone for polymyalgia rheumatica. Although the symptoms improved, additional studies demonstrated mediastinal lymphadenopathy, without associated pulmonary parenchymal disease. May we review the x-ray studies?\\nDR. VICTORINE V. MUSE: A radiograph of the chest (Fig. 1) demonstrates right paratracheal and possibly left paratracheal fullness. The cardiac silhouette is slightly widened, and the lungs are clear with low volumes. The CT scan (Fig. 2) confirms the presence of bulky right paratracheal and pretracheal lymph nodes, as well as prevascular, precarinal, subcarinal, azygoesophageal-recess, and axillary lymphadenopathy. In addition, there is slight pericardial thickening or a small amount of fluid. The lung parenchyma is clear, without evidence of pleural involvement.\\nDR. PASTERNACK: Will you comment on the subdiaphragmatic findings?\\nDR. MUSE: There was no retrocrural or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Except for two or three simple hepatic cysts, the visualized portions of the liver, pancreas, spleen, and kidneys were normal.\\nDR. PASTERNACK: I shall begin by commenting on this patient\\'s aches and pains. Her long history of axial and proximal pain and stiffness, together with laboratory findings consistent with anemia and elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, led to the initial diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica and a trial of low-dose prednisone therapy. In polymyalgia rheumatica nocturnal symptoms are usually eclipsed by the severe pain and stiffness experienced on arising, and thus her pain syndrome is somewhat atypical for that disorder. Moreover, mediastinal lymphadenopathy is not associated with the syndrome, and I am forced to consider additional diagnoses.\\nSymptoms reminiscent of polymyalgia rheumatica can be seen in rheumatoid arthritis, but that diagnosis cannot be established in this case in the absence of frank synovitis or detectable rheumatoid factor. Although lymphadenopathy is relatively common in rheumatoid arthritis, it is usually associated with longstanding joint disease in seropositive patients and is more frequently generalized than restricted to the mediastinum. The evolution of a lymphoreticular malignant tumor in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a complication that might unify many of this patient\\'s findings, is usually restricted to patients with longstanding disease. Generalized lymphadenopathy is also common in systemic lupus erythematosus, and lymphomas have been reported sporadically in this setting. The constellation of this woman\\'s symptoms and physical findings, however, was not suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the low-titer, speckled pattern of antinuclear antibodies is nonspecific. A final rheumatologic consideration is fibromyalgia or fibrositis, a perplexing condition presenting with pain and stiffness and resembling polymyalgia rheumatica. In contrast to polymyalgia rheumatica, however, the sedimentation rate and immunoglobulin levels are normal in fibromyalgia. The patient typically has \"trigger points\" of exquisite tenderness, which apparently were lacking in this case, and should have normal x-ray films of the chest as well.\\nInfectious endocarditis has been associated with proximal rheumatic pain, and this patient\\'s systolic murmur, mitral-valve calcification, systemic symptoms, and laboratory findings make this consideration tantalizing. With more than a year of pain and stiffness, the absence of splenomegaly, cutaneous manifestations, clubbing, glomerulonephritis, a positive titer for rheumatoid factor, or positive blood cultures makes this diagnosis unlikely. In addition, diffuse mediastinal lymphadenopathy would be distinctly unusual in endocarditis. The patient\\'s many aches suggest several possible diagnoses, but they are largely excluded by the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which must become the focus of discussion.\\nAlthough this patient reported no risk factors for HIV infection, she had weight loss, malaise, possible fever, anemia, leukopenia, and hyperglobulinemia. We are not told of her differential white-cell count, her CD4 count, or the result of an HIV serologic test. For the remainder of this discussion I shall assume that she was not infected with HIV, especially since her course was indolent in comparison to that of HIV-infected patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy due to an opportunistic infection, a subject recently reviewed at one of these exercises.\\nMediastinal lymphadenopathy is generally asymptomatic but is readily documented by routine x-ray films of the chest and conjures up a broad differential diagnosis of infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic diseases. Less frequently, endocrine, metabolic, and poorly understood miscellaneous conditions may be responsible. In the absence of accessible superficial lymphadenopathy, the majority of patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy ultimately require direct histologic and microbiologic examination of the enlarged lymph nodes after mediastinoscopic examination and lymph-node biopsy. It is important to consider carefully each patient\\'s differential diagnosis preoperatively to spare the occasional patient the morbidity of a mediastinoscopic examination and to arrange for the appropriate diagnostic studies of excised tissue.\\nI shall begin by considering neoplastic and inflammatory causes of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and then consider infectious causes.\\nAn intrathoracic malignant tumor, such as a lung carcinoma with metastasis to the mediastinal lymph nodes, must be considered in any middle-aged patient. Lung carcinomas of all histologic types can spread to the mediastinum, although hilar spread is far more common. Mediastinal involvement can produce esophageal compression and dysphagia, although this patient experienced pain on swallowing rather than mechanical obstructive symptoms. She reported no use of tobacco, and we are not told of occupational exposures to radionuclide or chemical carcinogens. No primary pulmonary parenchymal lesion was visualized on repeated x-ray films of the chest or on CT scanning. In the absence of a detectable primary lesion it would be unusual for a patient to have extensive metastatic carcinoma in the mediastinal lymph nodes. Occult carcinoma can be detected in high-risk patients by cytologic examinations of sputum or bronchoscopic washings, but such patients rarely have evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A carcinoma arising from an intraabdominal source may spread to the mediastinal lymph nodes, but that occurrence is unlikely in the absence of symptoms, laboratory evidence such as occult gastrointestinal bleeding or abnormal urinalysis, or a primary tumor or subdiaphragmatic metastatic disease detectable by CT scanning in the liver, the kidneys, the pancreas, the adrenal glands, or the retroperitoneum. Finally, esophageal carcinoma must be considered, since local extension to mediastinal lymph nodes is common. This patient did not have typical risk factors for this malignant tumor and had at least six months of odynophagia without experiencing dysphagia when ingesting solid food; also, the stool test was negative for occult blood. The CT scan of the chest usually demonstrates an asymmetric and segmentally thickened esophagus, consistent with a primary malignant tumor at this site, and this patient\\'s scan did not demonstrate any esophageal abnormalities. I assume that her swallowing symptoms did not suggest true dysphagia, since a barium contrast study was not performed.\\nLymphoma must be considered in this patient with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and sweats, weight loss, and possible fever for six months. Mediastinal involvement has been reported in 18 to 43 percent of patients with non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, but fewer than half of them had localization of their intrathoracic disease to the superior mediastinum. Patients with non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma restricted to the mediastinum (i.e., primary mediastinal lymphoma) generally present with rapidly progressive disease and have symptoms due to constrictive pericarditis, esophageal involvement, the superior vena cava syndrome, and chest pain. The absence of such an accelerated course makes this diagnosis unlikely in the case under discussion.\\nHodgkin\\'s disease cannot be excluded from consideration, since intrathoracic disease is present so commonly. Involvement of the lymph nodes in the superior mediastinum is three to four times more common in Hodgkin\\'s disease than in non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma. Hodgkin\\'s disease commonly presents with palpable superficial lymph nodes with contiguous mediastinal involvement, defining stage II disease. Presentation with isolated mediastinal disease is usually observed in younger patients with the nodular-sclerosing histologic pattern who do not have constitutional symptoms. Middle-aged patients more commonly present with B symptoms, and the patients who lack palpable lymph nodes often have isolated retroperitoneal rather than mediastinal disease. These considerations lead me away from the diagnosis of lymphoma. The axillary-lymph-node biopsy was undertaken to confirm the diagnosis of lymphoma but was nondiagnostic.\\nI shall turn to several noninfectious inflammatory conditions that are associated with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Foremost of these is sarcoidosis, a generalized disorder recognized on pathological examination by the presence of noncaseating granulomas. Its clinical features result from the pathophysiologic sequelae of these granulomatous lesions or from associated inflammatory processes, such as erythema nodosum. Although the immunopathologic features of this disease reflect aberrant immunoregulation, with exaggerated local T-helper-cell responses leading to macrophage activation, granuloma formation, and ultimately fibrosis, the nature of the initial immunogenic signal remains unknown. Most often sarcoidosis is a disease of early adulthood, with peak frequencies reported in the third and fourth decades of life, but it can occur throughout life. In the United States the frequency of sarcoidosis is roughly 10 times higher in blacks than whites, but in Africa the frequency is less clear because of the increased prevalence of tuberculosis. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue are common, particularly in patients with a subacute presentation, as in this case, and arthralgias due to joint involvement can be seen. Anemia, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and hyperglobulinemia are frequent, and intrathoracic lymphadenopathy is present in most of the cases. A variety of other laboratory abnormalities, including hypercalcemia and evidence of cholestatic hepatitis, can occur, depending on the extent and location of the extrapulmonary disease. Elevation of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme level is proportional to the extent of granuloma formation and may be more helpful as an adjunctive laboratory finding to monitor the course of the disease than as confirmation of the initial diagnosis, since elevation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme may also occur with other granulomatous processes. No angiotensin-converting-enzyme level was reported in this case. Anergy is another common feature of sarcoidosis. The presence of a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to tuberculin does not exclude the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, since skin-test reactivity to tuberculin can be seen when the diseases coexist. In the current era of universal precautions, the Kveim reaction is no longer available for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.\\nOn further consideration the diagnosis of sarcoidosis falls short. Of most importance, hilar lymphadenopathy is the most common locus of regional lymphadenopathy in this disease and is present in 75 to 90 percent of the patients. Paratracheal lymphadenopathy certainly occurs, but almost always in conjunction with hilar disease. Joint involvement usually presents early in the course of sarcoidosis as diffuse arthralgias, often accompanied by erythema nodosum, or it can be associated at any stage of the disease with asymmetric large-joint monoarthritis or oligoarthritis. The duration of this patient\\'s diffuse arthralgias exceeded such a prodromal stage of sarcoidosis, and she did not have frank synovitis. Constitutional features associated with subacute disease are associated generally with hilar lymphadenopathy and often with active lung disease, manifested by cough, dyspnea, fine rales, and radiologic evidence of pulmonary parenchymal disease. Such pulmonary signs and symptoms were absent in this case.\\nSeveral other inflammatory conditions with characteristic mediastinal lymphadenopathy merit brief mention. Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, a syndrome initially reported by Rosai and Dorfman, almost always presents in a younger population with massive cervical lymphadenopathy. Mediastinal or perihilar involvement (or both) occurs in roughly half the patients but always in the presence of cervical disease. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is an infiltrative disorder recognized by a characteristic polymorphic cellular infiltrate with lymphoid atypia together with angiocentric granulomatous inflammation. Nodular pulmonary infiltrates are universally present in this condition, although the patients may present initially with generalized lymphadenopathy. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is present in only a minority of the cases. The absence of pulmonary parenchymal disease and characteristic extrapulmonary foci of disease makes this diagnosis unlikely. Angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy is associated with lymph-node enlargement and systemic symptoms, but it generally has an acute onset and a rapidly progressive course. Lymph-node involvement is usually generalized and associated with hepatosplenomegaly. In contrast to these progressive multisystem disorders, giant follicular hyperplasia of the mediastinal lymph nodes is a benign and frequently asymptomatic disorder. In the typical cases reported from this hospital the involved lymph nodes were consistently larger than those in this patient. Thus, both clinical and radiologic features make this diagnosis improbable.\\nOf the infectious granulomatous causes of isolated mediastinal lymphadenitis, tuberculosis and infections due to endemic fungi are transmitted by inhalation of infectious aerosols, with primary pulmonary infection and subsequent lymphohematogenous spread. The clinical manifestations of these infections are similar in many ways, with syndromes of primary infection as well as focal or disseminated extrapulmonary disease. Hilar lymphadenopathy usually occurs as part of the primary complex of a peripheral pulmonary infection, with involvement of the draining regional lymph nodes. Before the development of a strong cellular immune response, the regional lymph nodes fail to contain the proliferating organisms. They can spread through lymphatic channels to additional mediastinal lymph nodes, eventually contaminating thoracic-duct lymph and reaching the systemic circulation. Thus, hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the presence of focal pulmonary disease is usually considered to be a manifestation of primary infection. Such lymphadenitis in the absence of a pulmonary focus may represent primary disease when the primary pulmonary focus is too small to be visualized by conventional techniques; it is commonly recognized in this manner in children. Alternatively, these findings may represent focal reactivation of a previously infected lymph node, similar to the pathogenesis of scrofula in superficial regional lymph nodes.\\nPrimary tuberculous infection may occur in middle age in a region with a low frequency of tuberculosis, such as the United States, but it is not likely to be the source of mediastinal disease in an adult raised in an area with a high frequency of tuberculosis. The prevalence of tuberculosis in Ethiopia in 1987 was reported to be 126 cases per 100,000 population, which is approximately 10 times that in the United States. Thus, the patient under discussion was almost certainly infected during childhood, and isolated mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenitis would be a relatively uncommon form of reactivation disease in adults.\\nThe nature of mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenitis in adults has been discussed repeatedly in the past 40 years, since antituberculous chemotherapy invested this classic differential diagnosis with important therapeutic implications. Several reports describing tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenitis in adults without parenchymal infiltrates have been published during the modern era of chemotherapy. Fever, anorexia, malaise, and weight loss were common manifestations, although a third of the affected patients were asymptomatic, with the disease identified only by routine x-ray films of the chest. Non-white patients were overrepresented in these series, raising the possibility that there is a genetic predisposition toward lymphatic reactivation in certain racial groups. Unilateral or bilateral disease may be present, but when unilateral disease exists, nodal involvement of the right paratracheal region predominates, as in this patient. CT images often show areas of low attenuation within the involved lymph nodes, which correlate with caseation. Despite this patient\\'s hematologic abnormalities, which might suggest miliary tuberculosis, concurrent disseminated tuberculosis with bone marrow involvement is not a characteristic finding in patients with tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenitis. Mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenitis can produce life-threatening complications by virtue of its strategic location. In addition to pericardial and superior vena cava disease, esophageal involvement by extrinsic compression or even contiguous spread of infection may lead to dysphagia or occasionally to odynophagia, and it is tempting to ascribe this patient\\'s symptoms to that process.\\nThe patient under discussion may have received BCG in childhood. Does this affect the differential diagnosis? Although the efficacy of vaccination with BCG, an attenuated isolate of Mycobacterium bovis, is a controversial subject, most observers believe that it reduces the risk of acquisition of M. tuberculosis by 30 to 80 percent. The wide variation in observed efficacy is probably due to lot-to-lot variation in vaccine potency and stability. BCG has produced local invasive infection and regional lymphadenitis in occasional recipients, but mediastinal disease due to BCG five decades after vaccination is unlikely. Unlike natural infection by M. tuberculosis, tuberculin-skin-test reactivity after BCG vaccination is generally circumscribed (usually less than 10 mm in diameter), and transient. When an adult who has had distant BCG vaccination is found to have a vigorous tuberculin reaction, it is virtually always indicative of M. tuberculosis infection, as I suspect it was in this case.\\nAmong the fungal infections that share clinical features with tuberculosis, histoplasmosis is probably the closest mimic of mycobacterial disease, and it has a striking propensity to produce mediastinal lymphadenitis, with late granuloma formation or fibrosis. This patient had no pulmonary, hepatic, or splenic calcification to suggest past exposure to histoplasmosis, and complement-fixation studies for the serologic diagnosis of histoplasmosis are not available to us. According to the unique tabulation by Wilson, however, histoplasmosis has not been reported from Ethiopia, but it does occur in central and western sub-Saharan Africa. Histoplasma capsulatum duboisii, the causative agent of so-called African histoplasmosis, differs from the more cosmopolitan H. capsulatum by the frequency of skin and skeletal disease and the rarity of pulmonary lesions. Lymphadenitis in this condition is generally restricted to patients with disseminated disease. However, like H. capsulatum, this organism appears to be restricted to central and western areas of sub-Saharan Africa. In view of the limited resources available for the confirmation of such diseases in Ethiopia, this information makes histoplasmosis less likely, but it probably cannot be excluded entirely. Blastomycosis is less commonly associated with mediastinal lymphadenopathy than histoplasmosis, and localized intrathoracic disease is almost always restricted to the lungs. Furthermore, blastomycosis has not been reported from Ethiopia. Although we generally associate cryptococcal infections with immunocompromised hosts, cryptococcosis also occurs in otherwise normal persons. Once again, the radiologic abnormalities present in the case under discussion do not match those generally observed in pulmonary cryptococcosis, since mediastinal lymphadenopathy occurs in only 10 percent of the patients and usually accompanies lobar or segmental consolidation.\\nI shall close by returning to this patient\\'s aches and pains. If she indeed was found to have mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenitis, might her manifestations have reflected tuberculous rheumatism, Poncet\\'s disease? The polyarthritis observed nearly 100 years ago by Poncet in patients with tuberculosis, notable for the absence of mycobacteria in involved joints, occurred in an era when alternative diagnoses, particularly rheumatoid arthritis, were difficult to confirm. It is probable that many of Poncet\\'s original cases would be challenged today. However, rare patients with tuberculosis do present with symmetric arthritis or oligoarthritis with culture-negative synovitis, or even diffuse arthralgias without objective arthritis. The key to the diagnosis of tuberculous rheumatism is the resolution of symptoms after the institution of antituberculous therapy. I believe that the patient had tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenitis and that the diagnostic procedure was a mediastinoscopic examination.\\nMELINDA MAGGARD: Will you comment on the negative skin test for candida?\\nDR. PASTERNACK: Although candida is a ubiquitous saprophyte and potential pathogen and we expect normal persons to mount a candida-skin-test reaction, the frequency of a positive candida reaction in normal persons is less than 100 percent. If one wants to document anergy formally, one has to ascertain skin-test reactivity to a panel of skin-test antigens.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Several physicians saw the patient before and during her hospital course.\\nDR. WILLIAM SCHMITT: This patient was referred to me through the medical walk-in clinic. My initial diagnostic consideration was tuberculosis versus lymphoma. A smear for acid-fast bacilli and a culture for sputum were attempted, but the patient could not produce any sputum. I sent her to the lymphoma clinic to expedite a mediastinal biopsy.\\nDR. NESLI BASGOZ: During the initial evaluation in the medical walk-in clinic, we deemed the 15-mm PPD skin test not interpretable because she had had BCG vaccine. Dr. Pasternack pointed out, however, that that assumption was not true. Because of the positive PPD skin test at the time that steroid treatment was being instituted, we should have given consideration to a prophylactic trial of isoniazid. If so, perhaps the diagnostic workup could have been accelerated.\\nDR. ALAN C. AISENBERG: In the lymphoma clinic I considered it unlikely that the patient had lymphoma. Hodgkin\\'s disease or non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma would be very unusual in a patient whose sole manifestation of disease was in small mediastinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, the peripheral lymphadenopathy was unimpressive, and the patient came from a part of the world where an infectious process was far more likely. In an academic setting such as ours, many physicians place lymphoma high in their differential diagnosis in a variety of disease presentations; in fact, lymphoma is uncommon.\\nWe admitted the patient to the surgical service for biopsy of a mediastinal lymph node, but an axillary lymph node was biopsied instead. There was then some delay in convincing the patient to be readmitted for the required mediastinoscopic biopsy.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nTuberculous mediastinal lymphadenitis.\\nDR. MARK S. PASTERNACK\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nTuberculous mediastinal lymphadenitis, with tuberculous rheumatism (Poncet\\'s disease).\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. MARK: The diagnostic procedure was bronchoscopic examination followed by mediastinoscopic examination. The mucosa of the trachea and bronchi was normal. Mediastinoscopic examination revealed a large green-brown lymph node above the carina, which was biopsied.\\nThe lymph node was almost entirely replaced either by necrotic tissue (Fig. 3) or by compact tuberculoid granulomas (Fig. 4) with Langhans\\' giant cells (Fig. 5). Two multinucleated histiocytes contained single acid-fast bacilli (Fig. 5, inset). When organisms are present in very small numbers, mycobacterial DNA can be identified in granulomatous tissue by a polymerase chain reaction, which amplifies specific genomes. Culture of the lymph node later yielded M. tuberculosis, which was susceptible to all the commonly employed antibiotics.\\nMacroscopic evidence of tuberculosis in hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes has been found in 87 percent of 785 autopsies of patients with nonprogressive pulmonary tuberculosis. In 26 percent of the cases the involved lymph nodes were easily found by inspection and palpation, whereas in 61 percent it was necessary to cut the lymph nodes into thin slices to find the lesions. These findings indicate what an effective filter and sump the lymph nodes are in tuberculosis. Widening of the tracheal bifurcation angle in radiographic studies may serve as a clue to mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenitis when the lung fields are clear. Mediastinal lymphadenitis can be sampled by transcarinal aspiration biopsy. Untreated mediastinal tuberculosis can lead to chronic systemic illness, as in this case, or to disastrous spread of infection or hemorrhage if the tuberculosis erodes into a bronchus, a pulmonary artery, or the esophagus.\\nDR. SCHMITT: The patient was started on a four-drug regimen before the report of the cultures came back. The drugs were continued for 312 months and then replaced by isoniazid and rifampin alone. All her symptoms, including the arthralgias, have disappeared. She has gained about 7 kg in weight and feels fine, with regression of the lymphadenopathy and disappearance of the dysphagia.\\nDR. MARK: Was the swallowing difficulty due to the mechanical effects of the lymph nodes?\\nDR. PASTERNACK: She did have lymphadenopathy abutting the esophagus in the subcarinal and azygoesophageal regions, and I suspect that it was the source of the swallowing difficulty. Patients of this type sometimes have late fibrosis in that area, with the development of a traction diverticulum of the esophagus.\\nDR. AISENBERG: It is very unusual for patients with lymphoma to have difficulty in swallowing unless there is massive lymphadenopathy.',\n",

GREER: The radiographs of the femur clearly\\npoint to a longstanding process involving the shaft.\\nThere is fusiform widening of the diaphysis, with a\\nthickened cortex. Within the bone one can make out\\nwhat appears to be a second cortex, giving the appear-\\nance of \"a bone within a bone.\" The expanded outer\\ncortex is well modeled, and there is no evidence of\\nrecent periosteal bone formation or discrete bone de-\\nstruction. The internal structural changes are visible\\nthroughout the entire shaft, blending with more nor-\\nmal bone proximally and distally. Considerable time\\nhad to pass for these changes in architecture to have\\ntaken place. A recently developing bone tumor or in-\\nfection would show acute, not chronic, periosteal\\nchanges, with acute loss of bone substance that had\\nnot yet had time to remodel. The changes shown in\\nthis case typify end-stage bone remodeling.\\nThe only diagnosis consistent with this radiograph-\\nic picture is healed acute childhood hematogenous os-\\nteomyelitis. I assume that it was hematogenous be-\\ncause there is no historical or radiologic evidence of\\nprior trauma or a surgical procedure involving the\\nfemur, that it occurred in childhood because of the\\ncompleteness of the bone remodeling, and that it was\\nhealed because there was a well-remodeled involu-\\ncrum with a well-contained sequestrum, the remnant\\nof the old infected, necrotic cortex, with no historical\\nor radiologic evidence of disease activity during the\\nintervening years.\\nWas the thigh pain that was treated by a series of\\ninjections at the age of 15 or 16 years the initial epi-\\nsode of acute osteomyelitis? Acute hematogenous\\nosteomyelitis of the magnitude that would cause these\\nextensive bony changes is rarely painless. Since there\\nhad been no intervening history of thigh pain, I\\nhave to assume that that episode was the acute event.\\nThe process must have resolved, perhaps with the\\naid of the injections, only to lie dormant for over\\n50 years.\\nAt this point it may be useful to review the natural\\nhistory and treatment of acute hematogenous osteo-\\nFeb. 11, 1993\\nmyelitis in the late 1930s, when the patient had the\\nchildhood episode. Just before that time osteomyelitis\\nhad claimed the lives of 25 to 50 percent of its victims\\nas a result of septicemia, multiple abscesses seeded by\\nthe primary infection, and toxemia caused by staphy-\\nlococcal toxins. By the mid-1930s staphylococcal anti-\\ntoxin was available, and its administration helped to\\nlocalize the infection and decrease the systemic effects\\nof the toxins. Penicillin, however, was not used in a\\nhuman being until 1941. In 1935 Domagk, in Ger-\\nmany, reported his discovery that a red dye known\\nas Prontosil had the remarkable ability to cure ex-\\nperimentally induced streptococcal infections in the\\nmouse as well as the human being. He entitled his\\npaper modestly, \"A contribution toward the chemo-\\ntherapy of bacterial infections.\" It was later learned\\nthat one of his human subjects was his daughter, who\\nhad a severe streptococcal abscess after a needle stick.\\nThe antibiotic age began with Domagk, and in 1939\\nhe was awarded the Nobel prize for his discovery, al-\\nthough World War II prevented him from receiving\\nhis gold medal until 1947.\\nBy the time that hematogenous osteomyelitis devel-\\noped in the patient under discussion in 1938 or 1939,\\nProntosil was already in general use, and its active\\ningredient, sulfanilamide, had been identified. Dr.\\nPerrin Long, of the Johns Hopkins University, has\\nbeen credited with bringing sulfonamides into the\\nUnited States, and the first major discussion of their\\nuse in surgical patients in this country occurred at the\\n1938 annual meeting of the American College of Sur-\\ngeons.*\\n4\\nThe debate about surgical treatment of acute osteo-\\nmyelitis up to this time had revolved around whether\\nto drain the infection during the acute toxemic stage or\\nto allow an abscess to become localized before drain-\\ning it. Both approaches had their proponents, and\\nboth had extremely high mortality rates. With the\\nadvent of sulfonamides a new question was raised.\\nWas it even necessary to operate on acute osteomyeli-\\ntis, or could it be cured with sulfonamides alone? Spo-\\nradic reports began to appear advocating sulfonamide\\ntreatment without surgical drainage. In the largest\\nsuch series in the United States, Hoyt et al. reported\\nin 1941 the survival of all 12 children with acute hem-\\natogenous osteomyelitis who had been treated with\\noral sulfonamides alone.\\nTherefore, this patient might have been treated\\nwithout an operation for an acute bone infection in\\n1938 or 1939. Because sulfanilamide was readily ab-\\nsorbed by the gut, it was given most often by mouth; to\\nproduce higher concentrations in the blood it may\\nhave been given subcutaneously at frequent intervals.\\nStaphylococcal antitoxin was also administered by in-\\njection. The injections that this patient received at the\\nage of 15 or 16 years must have been either sulfanila-\\nmide or staphylococcal antitoxin, or perhaps both,\\nand the sulfanilamide administration might also ex-\\nplain her allergy to sulfonamides.\\nBy the time the patient arrived at this hospital, how-\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Although she had\\nlittle fever on admission, she had diaphoresis, inspira-\\ntory rales audible at both lung bases, a swollen, warm,\\nand tender right thigh, and a knee effusion. By the\\nsecond day she had shaking chills and a high fever.\\nHer sedimentation rate and white-cell count were ele-\\nvated, and she was anemic. She was clearly having a\\nrapidly progressive septic course.\\nThe findings in the lungs on the CT scan obtained\\nat the referring hospital are more consistent with pul-\\nmonary abscesses than metastatic tumor. The changes\\nwere somewhat diffuse and appeared cavitary, and\\nbilateral pleural effusions were shown on the CT scan\\nof the chest obtained at this hospital. A thoracentesis\\nyielded 10 ml of yellowish fluid, with neutrophils but\\nno bacteria found on staining. The MRI scan of the\\nthigh obtained before admission showed an extensive\\ninflammatory reaction about the femur. A needle aspi-\\nration then might have been helpful in identifying the\\ncausative organism.\\nThe patient seems clearly to have had sepsis and\\nosteomyelitis of the right femur, which she probably\\nacquired as a teenager and which had become reac-\\ntive. She also had a diffuse pulmonary infection with\\nabscess formation and pleural effusion. Within the\\npast month she had a flu-like episode and a urinary\\ntract infection. The only positive bacterial culture had\\nbeen for E. coli in her initial sample of urine.\\nThere are three possible explanations for this collec-\\ntion of findings. The first and most likely is that her\\nlong quiescent femoral osteomyelitis, which was prob-\\nably staphylococcal in origin, had recurred, with bac-\\nteremia resulting in lesions in the lungs and perhaps\\nother organs as well. That would mean that the uri-\\nnary tract infection was either only tangentially relat-\\ned or that the E. coli cultured were contaminants. A\\nsecond explanation might be that there was an E. coli\\ninfection of the urinary tract and that it seeded the\\nfemur, lighting up the old osteomyelitis and resulting\\nin a femoral superinfection of Staphylococcus aureus with\\nE. coli. The pulmonary lesions in that situation might\\nhave been E. coli abscesses. The third possibility is\\nthat a malignant tumor developed in the osteomyelitic\\nfemur, causing the old osteomyelitis to flare up and\\nresulting in pulmonary metastases instead of abscess-\\nes. I shall discuss the last possibility first, since it\\nseems the most remote.\\nMalignant tumors have been described in associ-\\nation with chronic osteomyelitis.\" Almost all of them,\\nhowever, arose in or adjacent to draining sinus tracts.\\nAlthough squamous-cell carcinoma is the most fre-\\nquent malignant tumor in that setting, sarcomas such\\nas fibrosarcoma, angiosarcoma, and rhabdomyosar-\\ncoma and lymphomas have been reported. All these\\nreported tumors have been highly malignant, usually\\ncausing death within a year after the diagnosis. Malig-\\nnant hemangioendothelioma has been observed in\\na tibia that had been the site of a nonfistulous osteo-\\nmyelitis 27 years previously. That occurrence is ex-\\nceedingly rare, and malignant hemangioendothelioma\\nusually metastasizes to other bones before it spreads to\\nthe lungs. In this patient, with no other areas of\\nincreased uptake noted on the bone scan and with an\\nMRI scan that is more consistent with an inflamma-\\ntory process than with a tumor mass, it is very un-\\nlikely that a malignant hemangioendothelioma or\\nany other malignant tumor was the cause of the\\nproblem.\\nCould this entire picture have been caused by\\nE. coli? E. coli pneumonia is unusual. In 1967 Tillotson\\nand Lerner described the natural history of E. coli\\npneumonia in a large metropolitan hospital. They\\nidentified E. coli as the causative organism in only 20\\nof more than 1900 cases of pneumonia (1 percent)\\nover a period of 22 years. In most of these cases the\\npatients were debilitated and had concurrent diseases,\\nwhereas this patient was said to have been in good\\nhealth. In my experience E. coli is rarely found in long-\\nbone infections unless it has been introduced from the\\noutside, through a draining chronic sinus or by direct\\ncontamination. Vertebral and disk-space infections\\ncaused by hematogenous E. coli have been reported,\\nbut in this case there was no radiologic evidence of\\ndisk-space or vertebral involvement, at least in the\\nlumbosacral spine. I conclude that E. coli osteomyeli-\\ntis and pneumonia are improbable.\\nLate reactivation of osteomyelitis has been reported\\nsporadically in the literature for many years. 10-12 Dr.\\nHenry J. Mankin has taught that osteomyelitis that\\nhad its onset in the pre-penicillin era can never\\nbe considered cured. The famous case reported by\\nGallie¹ in 1951 of a first recurrence of femoral osteo-\\nmyelitis in a 90-year-old woman, 80 years after her\\nprimary infection, has been emphasized. The radio-\\ngraphs of the femur shown in Gallie\\'s article resemble\\nthose of the femur in the case under discussion. In\\n1984 a series of 12 cases of late reactivation of osteo-\\nmyelitis was reported.\" To my knowledge, that series\\nis the single largest in the literature to date. Recently,\\nthere was a case report of a recurrence in the patella\\nafter 50 years. 12\\nIn none of the published reports of late reactivation\\nof osteomyelitis has any predisposing factor been\\nidentified. It has been noted, however, that the bone\\ninfection can usually be brought under control with-\\nout complex surgical procedures and often with anti-\\nbiotics alone. Once the infection is under control, the\\npatients should probably receive antibiotics for the\\nrest of their lives.\\nThe laboratory values in this case are for the most\\npart consistent with a severe systemic, multifocal in-\\nfection. The anemia was normochromic and normo-\\ncytic. The absence of a platelet response and hypo-\\nalbuminemia are often seen with severe infections.\\nThe slight elevation of the alkaline phosphatase level\\nis consistent with increased bone turnover, and the\\nslight elevation of the serum aspartate aminotransfer-\\nase level with a normal lactate dehydrogenase level is\\nnot incompatible with the severity of the patient\\'s in-\\nfection.

GREER III\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nLate reactivation of staphylococcal osteomyelitis of\\nfemur, with pulmonary abscesses.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. ROSENBERG: Examination of the small biopsy\\nfragments showed necrotic lamellar cortical bone par-\\ntially surrounded by fibrous tissue, with scattered\\nlymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. In other\\nareas the marrow around the residual viable but par-\\ntially resorbed bony trabeculae contained fibrin, neu-\\ntrophils, and scattered mononuclear cells (Fig. 3).\\nPieces of skeletal muscle included in the specimen\\nwere infiltrated by acute inflammatory cells (Fig. 4). A\\nGram stain of the bone tissue showed abundant intra-\\ncellular and extracellular gram-positive cocci (Fig. 5),\\nand cultures revealed that they were S. aureus. There-\\nfore, on the basis of the clinical and pathological find-\\nings the diagnosis is activation of a focus of chronic\\nosteomyelitis of the femur, with extension into the sur-\\nrounding soft tissue, purulent thrombophlebitis, and\\nseptic pulmonary emboli.\\nThe acute phase of this infection developed in the\\nfemur at 15 or 16 years of age, as evidenced by the\\npresence of the well-formed solid layer of periosteal\\nreactive bone shown in the radiographs. In the setting\\nof osteomyelitis the layer of viable periosteal bone is\\nFigure 3.

The radiographs also show a par-\\ntially radiolucent center, which represents reactive fi-\\nbrosis and inflammation.\\nWhen the femoral infection became symptomatic\\ninitially, there was no historical information to suggest\\ndirect inoculation or contiguous spread from an adja-\\ncent area. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that\\nthe bacteria infected the femur through the blood sys-\\ntem.

Bacteria that lo-\\ncalize to this area proliferate and easily obstruct blood\\nflow, resulting in infarction and the creation of an\\nenvironment conducive to further bacterial prolifera-\\ntion. 18 In most patients the offending organism is\\nS. aureus. 16,19,20\\nEventually, the host response successfully contains\\nthe expanding focus of suppuration, and if adequately\\ntreated with antibiotics and operative drainage the\\npatient can be cured. In 5 to 25 percent of the cases,\\nhowever, acute hematogenous osteomyelitis fails to re-\\nsolve and persists as a chronic infection with periodic\\nrecrudescence. 17 The progression of acute osteomyeli-\\ntis into chronic osteomyelitis can result from delay in\\nthe diagnosis, extensive bone necrosis, abbreviated\\nantibiotic therapy, inadequate surgical drainage, and\\nweakened host defenses. The flare-ups of disease\\nactivity, which may occur after years of dormancy\\nas in the case under discussion, usually do not have an\\nobvious cause. The complications of chronic osteo-\\nmyelitis include pathologic fracture, sinus-tract for-\\nmation, septic arthritis, amyloidosis, endocarditis,\\nsepsis, and the development of a local squamous-\\ncell carcinoma or sarcoma. Purulent thrombophlebitis\\nand septic pulmonary emboli are uncommon seque-\\nlae.21 In the relatively few cases in which septic em-\\nboli were reported to be a complication of skeletal\\ninfection the patients were children who had acute\\nhematogenous osteomyelitis due to S. aureus. 22 In\\nsuch cases a failure to improve rapidly after ade-\\nquate antibiotic therapy usually indicates a need for\\nimmediate thorough débridement of the osseus in-\\nfection. 22\\nDR. EDWARD T. RYAN: A Gram stain of the foul-\\nsmelling material found at operation disclosed gram-\\n427\\npositive cocci in clusters. The patient was allergic to\\npenicillin and was therefore treated with intravenous-\\nly administered vancomycin. By the third postoper-\\native day all cultures remained negative; however, she\\ncontinued to be febrile, with a rise in the temperature\\nto 39°C, and she continued to have rigors. The intra-\\nvenous administration of clindamycin was begun, and\\ndefervescence occurred over the ensuing 48 to 72\\nhours. Although the aerobic cultures remained nega-\\ntive, the anaerobic cultures from multiple samples\\ngrew gram-positive cocci in clusters, which had the\\nbiochemical profile of S. aureus. There is one previous\\nreport23 of S. aureus from a patient with chronic osteo-\\nmyelitis that was also facile at growing anaerobically.\\nThe patient was treated for two months with intra-\\nvenously administered antibiotics.

       " 'A 57-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of reddish-purple lesions on the right lower extremity.\\nThe patient had been well until the age of 38 years, when he felt a mass in the right inguinal region. Two years later the mass increased slightly in size, and warmth and erythema developed about it, with a rise in the temperature to 39.9°C. The patient was admitted to the hospital, where physical examination showed a mass, 12.7 by 10 cm, in the right inguinal region. Cephalexin was administered by vein, with prompt resolution of the fever, local swelling, and erythema. A xerographic examination of the right inguinal region showed an unencapsulated collection of fat in the subcutaneous tissue, without abnormal calcific densities; the muscle planes were intact, the underlying bones appeared normal, and no cutaneous thickening was observed. The patient was discharged on the seventh hospital day.\\nEleven months later the patient returned to the hospital, where physical examination revealed that the mass was 30 by 10 cm in diameter, with severe local intertrigo. The mass was excised, and microscopical examination disclosed fibrofatty tissue and fibrotic lymph nodes. The postoperative course was complicated by the development of a hematoma, which was aspirated repeatedly. The patient was discharged on the 23rd hospital day. Eighteen days later he returned to the hospital because of persistent swelling about the incision. Pus was aspirated from the area, and a culture yielded abundant Staphylococcus aureus. Cephalexin was again given by vein, with resolution; the patient was discharged on the 11th hospital day.\\nOne month later massive swelling developed in the right lower extremity. A venographic examination revealed good filling of the superficial and deep venous systems except that the greater saphenous vein was not identified; no evidence of venous thrombosis or occlusion was seen. Follow-up films of the kidneys and renal collecting systems appeared normal. Elevation of the leg and elastic stockings were prescribed, with improvement.\\nAt the age of 43 years the patient returned to the hospital because of a rapid increase in swelling of the right leg, from the groin to the toes, without signs of cellulitis. Another venographic examination revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis; delayed films of the abdomen showed normal function of the urinary tract. The patient was discharged on the second hospital day.\\nDuring the next nine years the patient experienced repeated bouts of increased swelling and induration of the right leg, with chilliness and fever, followed by resolution after three or four days. At the age of 52 years he was readmitted to the hospital because of a marked increase in swelling, with fever, chills, and sweats. On physical examination the temperature was 38.9°C. The patient appeared sweaty and mildly ill. Physical examination was negative except for massive, indurated edema that began just distal to the right inguinal ligament; the circumference of the right thigh was 71.1 cm, and that of the left thigh 50.8 cm; the circumference of the right calf was 53.3 cm, and that of the left calf 35.6 cm; erythema was present over the dorsum of the right foot. The urine was normal. The hematocrit was 39.9 percent; the white-cell count was 15,400 (15.4×10º per liter) with 90 percent neutrophils; the prothrombin time and partial-thromboplastin time were normal. The urea nitrogen, uric acid, bilirubin, protein, albumin, globulin, electrolytes, serum aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal. Cultures of blood and urine yielded no growth of microorganisms. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 117 and was normal otherwise. Radiographs of the chest revealed slight parenchymal scarring in both upper lobes; the heart size was normal. Cefazolin was administered by vein, and the fever resolved; the patient was discharged on the 10th hospital day.\\nAt the age of 57 years the patient returned to the hospital because of the development of enlarging purple lesions on the right leg, first noticed nine weeks earlier.\\nThe patient was unmarried and lived alone; he worked as a janitor. There was a distant history of bilateral hydrocele repair. He had received one transfusion 15 years earlier in connection with surgical repair of a nasal injury. He used no medications except for hydrochlorothiazide. He did not smoke and consumed little alcohol; there was no history of homosexual activity, intravenous drug abuse, weight loss, or undue radiation exposure.\\nPhysical examination revealed multiple variegated, red, purple, and gray-tan firm nodules on the skin of the right leg (Fig. 1 and 2). A purple nodule, 5 mm, on the lower anterior aspect of the right leg blanched on pressure; a larger firm, purple plaque, 1.5 cm, on the right lower leg did not blanch. The lesions were most prominent on the anterolateral aspect of the distal lower leg; purple nodules were seen on the sole of the foot and the first and second toes; multiple pinpoint red macules were present diffusely over the thigh in a follicular distribution, and subcutaneous grape-like nodules were palpated on the thigh and calf. Radiographs of the chest were unchanged.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. JOOP M. GREVELINK*: Several historical features are noteworthy in this case. The patient had chronic edema of the right lower extremity, presumably due to the previous excision of a benign right inguinal mass. With the exception of the edema there were no physical or laboratory findings to suggest the presence of systemic disease or chronic illness. He denied any risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection except for a blood transfusion 15 years before admission.\\nDr. Waltman, may we review the radiologic studies?\\nDR. ARTHUR C. WALTMAN: The venograms are normal, with the exception of occlusion of the greater saphenous vein in the lower leg. An x-ray film of the chest is normal.\\nDR. GREVELINK: Both the nodular appearance and the reddish-purple color of the skin lesions are very important in formulating the differential diagnosis in this case. I shall begin by addressing the morphologic features of the lesions that will guide me in generating a differential diagnosis.\\nThis patient had several different lesions, varying from the aforementioned nodules to plaques and macules. Nodules are elevated lesions greater than 0.5 cm in both width and depth, a plaque is an elevated lesion greater than 0.5 cm in width but without great depth, and a macule is a flat lesion without palpable induration. In this case the nodules were the predominant lesions and were described as firm rather than soft and compressible. In addition to these nodules there were red follicular macules, reflecting follicular inflammation or hemorrhage; they are commonly secondary to chronic stasis and are sometimes seen in scurvy. I do not believe that the follicular macules reflected the primary disease process.\\nSkin nodules can be epidermal, mixed epidermal and dermal, dermal, or entirely subcutaneous. Nodules originating from the epidermis can be exophytic or endophytic. Dermal nodules often occur without alteration of the overlying epidermis. Subcutaneous nodules are either mobile or attached to deeper structures. Sometimes a skin biopsy is helpful to determine the location of a nodule. In this patient no loss of skin markings was seen over most of the lesions. Thus, the lesions appeared to be either dermal or subcutaneous.\\nThe reddish-purple color of the lesions was also an important clinical feature. The diagnostic tool diascopy is used to determine whether a red or purple lesion blanches. Total blanching of a lesion when pressure is exerted with a glass slide suggests telangiectatic and focal erythematous inflammatory lesions. The erythema in blanching lesions is due to capillary dilatation. In contrast, the red color in non-blanching lesions is usually due to extravasation of erythrocytes, as in vasculitis, and these lesions are then referred to as \"purpura.\" Residual color on diascopy can reflect the presence of an increased number of cells or an increase in ground substance in the lesion. A purple color usually reflects a vascular process. Deep vascular or pigmented lesions appear as bluish nodules because of the scattering of visible light in the dermis. The reddish-purple nodules of this patient were probably predominantly dermal and vascular. The differential diagnosis should therefore include acquired and congenital vascular diseases, neoplasms, infections, and inflammatory diseases.\\nAcquired proliferative diseases of vascular origin that can present as reddish-purple nodules include angiosarcoma, Kaposi\\'s sarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, proliferating angioendotheliomatosis, pyogenic granuloma, papular angioplasia, acroangiodermatitis of Mali, Masson\\'s pseudoangiosarcoma, and angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia.\\nAngiosarcoma can develop from the endothelium of lymphatics (lymphangiosarcoma) or blood vessels (hemangiosarcoma). This subclassification is often very difficult to make, however, since there apparently is no difference in the clinical activity. Angiosarcomas are usually seen in adults. One type that occurs in elderly patients starts as a bluish macule and gradually enlarges to form a large plaque with satellite nodules, most commonly on the face and scalp. Another presentation is in the setting of chronic lymphedema. Stewart and Treves in 1948 reported six cases of lymphangiosarcoma in patients with postmastectomy lymphedema. Since then, many other cases in women have been reported. In addition, cases unassociated with postmastectomy lymphedema as well as several cases in men have been reported. Eby et al. calculated the average interval from mastectomy to the appearance of the neoplasm to be approximately 10 years. When the lymphangiosarcoma was unassociated with mammary carcinoma, the antecedent lymphedema had been present for approximately 20 years. This type of angiosarcoma occurs independently of radiation exposure. A third type of angiosarcoma has been associated with exposure to radiation, without lymphedema. Was this patient\\'s chronic edema actually lymphedema? The two previous surgical procedures in the groin could have impeded lymphatic flow to the right lower limb. Although unusual in men, lymphedema-associated angiosarcoma should be considered high on the list of possible diagnoses in this case.\\nAnother disease deserving consideration is Kaposi\\'s sarcoma. Originally described in 1872 by Kaposi, this vascular tumor now exists in three distinct forms the classic or sporadic form, which occurs in elderly persons of Jewish or Mediterranean background, the endemic form described in indigenous Africans, and the epidemic form. The classic form has a male-to-female ratio of approximately 10:1 and most often presents on the lower limbs; it has an indolent course, and involvement of internal organs is observed only occasionally. The endemic form often presents on the extremities in African patients of all ages and usually responds very well to treatment. Finally, the epidemic form is commonly seen in patients with HIV infection or those with other forms of acquired immune suppression, as seen after organ transplantation and chemotherapy. The course is often aggressive. Oral, anal, and internal involvement is common. Although this patient received a blood transfusion 15 years ago, Kaposi\\'s sarcoma is rare in the transfusion-associated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Furthermore, although lymphedema can be seen with Kaposi\\'s sarcoma, it rarely precedes the appearance of the nodules by many years, as occurred in this case. More commonly, lymphedema is a sequela of extensive Kaposi\\'s sarcoma. In addition, unilateral involvement would be highly unusual.\\nMalignant hemangiopericytoma, first described by Stout and Murray in 1942, is uncommon in adults. It presents usually as a solitary lesion, although multiple lesions have been reported in one case. Metastasis is common, except when the tumor presents at birth. Hemangiopericytomas are usually subcutaneous. This diagnosis cannot be excluded with certainty but is improbable in this case.\\n\"Proliferating angioendotheliomatosis\" is an uncommon intravascular disorder, leading to occlusion of blood vessels. Two variants have been described - a reactive benign type, which has been associated with subacute bacterial endocarditis in many cases and involutes spontaneously, and a malignant type, which is rapidly fatal and has been shown to be intravascular lymphomatosis rather than an endothelial disorder. In view of the usual widespread distribution of these lesions this diagnosis appears unlikely in a patient who presented with unilateral limb involvement.\\nPyogenic granulomas, also called eruptive hemangiomas, present as moist, purple papules, often after trauma. Although commonly seen on the digits and gingiva as solitary lesions, they have been described as multiple lesions mimicking amelanotic melanoma or angiosarcoma. Papular angioplasia is a benign disorder that occurs in elderly patients and presents with purple papules and nodules in the head and neck region. Epidermal changes such as scaling and crusting are often seen, and as in cases of pyogenic granuloma surface hemorrhage is common. Papular angioplasia is self-limited and often resolves spontaneously.\\nBecause of the location and the absence of epidermal change overlying the lesions in this patient and because there is no history of bleeding from the lesions, I shall exclude pyogenic granulomas and papular angioplasia from the differential diagnosis.\\nAcroangiodermatitis of Mali, also referred to as pseudo-Kaposi\\'s sarcoma, is seen in association with chronic stasis dermatitis of the lower legs. Purple plaques resembling those of Kaposi\\'s sarcoma occur as sequelae of arteriovenous anomalies in this disorder. Since it usually presents bilaterally and occurs principally in elderly patients, it is an improbable diagnosis in this case.\\nMasson\\'s pseudoangiosarcoma, also known as intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia, usually presents as a solitary lesion. It generally arises in association with another benign vascular proliferation, such as a cavernous hemangioma or a venous lake. The lesion is intravascular and can easily be distinguished from angiosarcoma.\\nAngiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is an uncommon disorder that presents with purple nodules and plaques in the scalp, ear, and neck. Multiple lesions can coalesce to form grape-like clusters. The location of the lesions in the patient under discussion makes this diagnosis improbable.\\nHereditary proliferative vascular diseases presenting with purple nodules that deserve mention include the blue-rubber-bleb-nevus syndrome, multiple glomangiomas, Maffucci\\'s syndrome, and the Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. The blue-rubber-bleb-nevus syndrome, an autosomal-dominant disease, presents with soft, compressible, bluish nodules usually on the upper half of the body. Lesions also occur in the intestinal tract and cause intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding. Multiple glomangiomas, another autosomal-dominant disease, present early in life with grouped, often tender bluish nodules. Maffucci\\'s syndrome presents in the second decade with nodular enchondromas involving the bones of the hands and feet. Marked phlebectasia and hemangiomas are often found on the affected limb. Angiosarcoma has been reported to develop in patients with this uncommon syndrome. In view of this patient\\'s clinical presentation I shall exclude these three congenital vascular disorders from further consideration. The Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome is characterized by limb hemihypertrophy, port-wine stains with hemangiomas, and venous malformations, which are usually present at birth. In addition to the pseudo-Kaposi sarcoma of the Mali type, another type of pseudo-Kaposi sarcoma, the pseudo-Kaposi sarcoma of the Stewart-Bluefarb type, has been described. It occurs in the Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome and presents with ulcerating purple nodules and plaques in a hypertrophic limb. The negative venographic studies of this patient and the absence of congenital vascular malformations of the skin make this diagnosis unlikely.\\nNeoplasms, such as malignant melanoma, lymphoma, leukemia, and metastatic hemorrhagic carcinoma, must also be considered in the differential diagnosis in this case. Although no mention was made of the presence of atypical nevi or of a family history of melanoma in this patient, the possibility of regionally metastatic malignant melanoma should be considered. Acrolentiginous melanoma, a subtype of melanoma that occurs on the extremities, can be undetected, and regression of a primary superficial spreading melanoma is not uncommon. The lesions observed in this patient could represent metastatic melanoma originating from an unknown primary site. The postoperative lymphatic blockage might have prevented further spread of the tumor. Metastasis to the contralateral inguinal lymph nodes has been reported in this setting, however. Although the patient\\'s x-ray films of the chest showed no suspicious shadows, the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma cannot be excluded. Cutaneous lymphoma can present as a primary or metastatic lesion in the skin; typically, plum-colored nodules are observed. Although rare, lymphoma is also reported to occur in postmastectomy lymphedema. The tumor stage of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) is characterized by the appearance of dark-red plaques and nodules that commonly ulcerate. Leukemias can present with purplish, nodular infiltrates of the skin as well; this presentation is seen especially in acute monocytic leukemia and hairy-cell leukemia. Carcinomas metastatic to skin can appear as purple nodules. The tumors that have a propensity for cutaneous metastasis include breast, lung, and intestinal carcinomas. The frequency of cutaneous metastasis from solid tumors is approximately 3 percent. The clinical findings in the patient under discussion are consistent with any of these neoplastic diseases.\\nInfections that present with reddish-purple nodules include sporotrichosis, Mycobacterium marinum infection, septic vasculitic lesions, bacillary angiomatosis, and verruca peruana. Sporotrichosis is a chronic deep mycosis caused by Sporothrix schenckii. It presents with dark, erythematous, nonblanching nodules, usually in a linear array on an extremity. Ascending lymphangitic spread after inoculation at a distal site is the hallmark of this disease. Although initially not ulcerated, these nodules can suppurate. Systemic signs of infection are usually absent. Because of its usual unilateral presentation sporotrichosis should be considered. M. marinum infection can present with multiple ascending nodules, which commonly ulcerate, after contact of an extremity with water from a fish tank or other source. Septic vasculitis due to staphylococcal, pneumococcal, meningococcal, or pseudomonas septicemia can present with purple nodules. In this case the unilateral distribution and the absence of severe constitutional symptoms rule out septic vasculitis. Bacillary angiomatosis, also referred to as epithelioid angiomatosis, is an uncommon vascular proliferation that occurs in HIV-positive patients. In the disseminated form there may be erythematous to bluish-purple lesions, usually involving the face and trunk and occasionally involving the oral mucosa. A rothia species has recently been identified as the causative bacterium. Verruca peruana is caused by Bartonella bacilliformis. In the delayed chronic stage of this infection there may be widespread small, nodular vascular lesions, with a predilection for the extensor surfaces of the lower extremities. The geographic distribution of this disease is limited to higher altitudes in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. The last two diagnoses appear highly unlikely in this patient.\\nInflammatory processes that deserve mention in the differential diagnosis of this patient\\'s illness include vasculitis and granulomatous diseases. Although vasculitis can present with purple plaques and nodules, the most common presentation is with palpable purpuric papules, 1 to 5 mm in diameter. The different forms of vasculitis include hypersensitivity vasculitis, septic or embolic vasculitis, and vasculitis associated with collagen-vascular diseases. The absence of systemic symptoms in the patient under discussion, the presence of the lesions for nine weeks, and the unilateral involvement make vasculitis improbable.\\nGranulomatous lesions can appear as dusky, purplish nodules in the skin. Sarcoidal granulomas, tuberculids, Crohn\\'s disease that has spread to the skin, erythema nodosum, and erythema induratum can all present with individual lesions that resemble those seen in this patient. His past medical history and the recent lack of any supporting physical, radiologic, or laboratory findings make these diagnoses unlikely.\\nAfter discussing the differential diagnosis from a morphologic perspective I must account for the historical and physical findings in this case. The diagnostic keys include the long history of unilateral lymphedema of the right leg and the purple nodules confined to the affected limb. I believe that angiosarcoma developed secondary to the longstanding lymphedema, which was probably caused by the antecedent surgical procedures. Other common causes of chronic lymphedema include filariasis and Milroy\\'s disease. Filariasis is an infectious tropical disease that leads to massive destruction of the lymphatics in the limbs, which usually are symmetrically affected. Milroy\\'s disease is a hereditary, autosomal-dominant disease presenting with lifelong chronic edema. Angiosarcoma has been reported in both diseases. From the history, however, these diseases do not appear to have caused the lymphedema in this patient. The proposed cause of tumorigenesis in chronic lymphedema is a decrease in local cellular immunity. In addition, circulating carcinogens, constitutional predisposition to tumor formation, and adjuvant radiation therapy have been suggested as possible causes of angiosarcoma arising in an edematous extremity. I believe that a skin biopsy was performed.\\nDR. ROBERT E. SCULLY: Dr. Lyon, will you tell us your impressions when you saw this patient?\\nDR. NANCY B. LYON: The blanching of the lesions and their rapid onset and progression during the time that we observed the patient in the clinic suggested angiosarcoma in a chronically lymphedematous extremity.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nAngiosarcoma arising in chronic lymphedema.\\nDR. JOOP M. GREVELINK\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nAngiosarcoma (Stewart-Treves syndrome).\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. DEMPSEY SPRINGFIELD: The patient had a skin biopsy, which led the surgeons to conclude that a definitive operation was imperative. The extent of the disease made it impossible to do an adequate resection of the lesion with reconstruction and necessitated a hip disarticulation, which we performed.\\nDR. ANDREW E. ROSENBERG: The examination of the biopsy specimen revealed an angiosarcoma. The amputated limb was massively edematous; many redpurple cutaneous plaques and nodules covered portions of the foot, with discontinuous extension of the process upward into the thigh, where small erythematous macules involved much of the surface. Sectioning of the skin and subcutaneous tissue revealed numerous hemorrhagic nodules in the subcutis and deep dermis (Fig. 3). Microscopical examination of the lesions on the foot showed dilated lymphatics partially occluded by organizing fibrin thrombi and lined by nonneoplastic endothelial cells. In the region of the knee the nodules and plaques were composed of malignant spindle and polygonal cells that either lined irregular interconnecting vascular spaces or grew in solid sheets (Fig. 4). Some of the vascular spaces were filled with red cells. The nodules of tumor, which were mainly subcutaneous and lacked continuity, extended to within 1 cm of the proximal cutaneous resection margin. Adjacent to some of the tumor nodules and scattered randomly throughout the subcutaneous fat there were clusters of well-formed lymphatics lined by endothelial cells that ranged from normal in appearance to atypical (Fig. 5) to malignant. The erythematous macules on the thigh were composed of dilated lymphatics with surrounding chronic inflammation. The chronic lymphedema was associated with prominent fibrosis of both the dermis and the subcutis. On the basis of these findings our diagnosis was angiosarcoma arising in the setting of chronic lymphedema (Stewart-Treves syndrome).\\nIn the vast majority of the more than 220 reported cases of the Stewart-Treves syndrome the underlying lymphedema has been caused by surgical interruption of lymphatic drainage. Approximately 90 percent of the sarcomas have followed radical mastectomy and axillary lymph-node dissection, and in some, but not all, of these cases there was an additional history of radiation therapy. Other reported types of chronic lymphedema in the Stewart-Treves syndrome have included congenital lymphedema, idiopathic acquired lymphedema, and lymphedema caused by venous thrombosis, trauma, infection, and filariasis. Edema secondary to cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease has not been associated with this complication. In patients who have undergone mastectomy the lymphedema usually develops within the first year after lymphatic disruption. The average duration of edema before the development of a neoplasm in these patients is 10 years (range, 0 to 30), which is in contrast to 38 years (range, 13 to 65) in patients with congenital lymphedema and 24 years (range, 8 to 40) in patients with acquired idiopathic lymphedema. The development of the tumor is insidious, and it may be manifested initially by mild cutaneous erythema. Eventually, it progresses to confluent ecchymoses and multiple palpable blue-red nodules, which may ulcerate.\\nHistologic examination demonstrates a spectrum of vascular differentiation ranging from benign-appearing, well-formed vessels resembling lymphatics, to irregular anastomosing vascular spaces lined by atypical endothelial cells, to sheets of anaplastic tumor cells with little or no evidence of lumen formation. The vessels may or may not contain red cells. Because the well-differentiated components of many of the tumors resemble lymphatics, the tumor was originally interpreted as lymphangiosarcoma. However, recent immunohistochemical and ultrastructural evidence suggests that the malignant endothelial cells have features of endothelial cells that line blood vessels rather than those that line lymphatics. Accordingly, these tumors are now generally referred to as angiosarcomas.\\nThe role of edema in the genesis of angiosarcoma is uncertain. It has been shown in animal models that the environment produced by longstanding lymphedema is conducive to atypical vascular proliferation, with mutations eventually leading to malignant transformation of the endothelial cells. Alternatively, the lymphedema may impair local immunity, preventing immune detection and destruction of the malignanttumor cells. In fact, skin-grafting experiments have shown that the lymphedematous region behaves as an \"immunologically privileged site.\"\\nThe natural history of angiosarcoma associated with chronic lymphedema is repeated recurrence and eventual metastasis, usually to the lungs. The clinical outcome is poor, with less than 10 percent of the patients surviving longer than five years after the diagnosis. The recommended treatment for a tumor of this type in an extremity is amputation, with or without radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\\nDR. SCULLY: Dr. Dow, will you tell us your approach to the patient?\\nDr. Edward C. Dow: After the right-hip disarticulation we administered six courses of the MAID regimen, consisting of mesna, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and dacarbazine, as well as irradiation therapy (5600 rad) to the right hemipelvis. The patient has tolerated this therapy well except for the occurrence of neutropenic fever and radiation dermatitis. He is a model patient in terms of his rehabilitation with a prosthesis. He is being followed closely to assess any evidence of recurrence and remains in complete remission 10 months after the operation.',\n",

MCNEELY, Assistant Editor\\nCASE 22-1993\\nPRESENTATION OF CASE\\nA 22-year-old man was admitted to the hospital\\nbecause of increasing swelling of the face.\\nThe patient had been well until 20 months earlier,\\nwhen a swelling developed on the inner aspect of the\\nright upper lip, with firm, slightly tender nodules. The\\nlesions enlarged gradually, and the patient soon de-\\ntected a second, similarly affected area along the buc-\\ncal mucosa beside the right lower jaw.\\nTen months before admission a biopsy of the le-\\nsions was performed elsewhere. Microscopical exami-\\nnation of the specimen was reported to show a dense\\ninflammatory infiltrate that included lymphocytes\\nand histiocytes, with foci of necrosis. The findings\\nwere believed to be consistent with marked chronic\\ninflammation. Review of the specimen at another\\ninstitution revealed fragments of fibromuscular tis-\\nsue; there were dense infiltrates of large, atypical-\\nappearing lymphocytes and histiocyte-like cells with\\nrare mitotic figures and extensive areas of necrosis\\nand hemorrhage; the findings were considered sug-\\ngestive of a malignant tumor. A complete blood\\ncount with a differential count was normal. Several\\nweeks later microscopical examination of another bi-\\nopsy specimen at a third institution disclosed a similar\\ninfiltration of striated muscle and fibrous tissue; im-\\nmunoperoxidase stains showed a predominance of\\nmature T lymphocytes, which were interpreted as\\nchronic inflammatory cells. A DNA hybridization\\nstudy showed no evidence of clonal B-cell or T-cell\\nrearrangements.\\nEight months before admission a physical examina-\\ntion revealed firm, enlarged tissue along the buccal\\nmucosa behind the right upper incisor teeth and the\\nright lower lip, with slight distortion of the lip; no\\nleukoplakia or discharge was found, and no lymphad-\\n1625\\nenopathy was detected; the physical examination was\\nnegative otherwise.\\nOne month later an otolaryngologist found no ab-\\nnormality except for the buccal process.

Two weeks later the otolaryn-\\ngologist noted that the patient was having difficulty\\nin smiling or whistling properly because of progres-\\nsive swelling. Physical examination showed more ex-\\ntensive submucosal induration in the right lower lip,\\nwithout loss of mucosal integrity; there was weakness\\nof the lower third of the right side of the face with\\nnumbness of the lower two thirds of the face, includ-\\ning the right upper teeth. Additional imaging studies\\nwere advised but were not performed. A test for hu-\\nman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies was\\nnegative. Microscopical examination of another biop-\\nsy specimen revealed only squamous epithelial hyper-\\nplasia.\\nTwo months before entry an oncology consultant\\nfound tenderness and nodularity in the right cheek,\\nwithout definite mucosal or cutaneous lesions; no\\nlymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly was found,\\nand the lungs and heart were normal. Imaging stud-\\nies were again suggested but were not performed.\\nAn empirical trial of acyclovir for one week fol-\\nlowed by ketoconazole for one week was without effect;\\nprednisone treatment (20 mg daily for one week) re-\\nsulted in transitory minor shrinkage with a decrease\\nin local discomfort.

THOMAS G. CropLEY*: In summary, this 22-\\nyear-old man had a 20-month history of slowly pro-\\ngressive, nodular submucosal swelling of the right up-\\nper and lower lips and right cheek, with eventual\\ninvolvement of the chin. He remained well otherwise,\\nand the results of laboratory evaluation were consis-\\ntently normal.\\nThree biopsies failed to yield a diagnosis. Infiltrates\\nof lymphoid cells and histiocytes were observed, but\\nno clonal lymphocytic proliferation could be identified\\nby DNA hybridization. Empirical treatment with an\\nantibiotic, with ketoconazole, and with acyclovir was\\nunsuccessful. Systemic administration of corticoster-\\noid seemed to help somewhat.\\nAside from the facial swelling, the only pertinent\\nphysical finding in this case was the subsequent devel-\\nopment of numbness of the lower two thirds of the\\nface and right upper teeth, which in view of the local-\\nized nature of the anesthesia probably was referable to\\nthe maxillary and mandibular branches of the trigem-\\ninal nerve, with weakness of the lower third of the\\nface. Weakness of facial muscles, unaccompanied by\\nevidence of weakness of more distant muscles, is sel-\\ndom due to a lesion in the motor cortex or cortical\\nfibers. Furthermore, there is no history of diplopia to\\nsuggest abducens palsy, a typical finding in patients\\nwith brain-stem lesions that cause damage to the nu-\\ncleus of the facial nerve. Thus, lacking additional in-\\nformation from the case history I must conclude that\\nthis weakness was due either to destruction of facial\\nmuscle by the pathologic process or to facial-nerve\\npalsy. I favor the latter for two reasons. First, the case\\nhistory suggests that the entire lower third of the right\\nside of the face was weak, although only a portion of\\nthat region was swollen, suggesting that facial muscles\\nsomewhat distant from the edematous area were in-\\nvolved. Second, there is clear evidence of involvement\\nof the fifth cranial nerve, supporting the contention\\nthat the muscle findings may also have been due to a\\ncranial neuropathy. The lower third of the face corre-\\nsponds to the region subserved by the buccal and\\nmandibular branches of the facial nerve.\\nThus, the initial differential diagnosis in this case\\nis that of disorders that produce persistent solid fa-\\ncial swelling with associated cranial-nerve signs. The\\ncauses of solid facial edema are many (Table 1). How\\nare we to sort through this list to arrive at a unifying\\ndiagnosis?\\nThe persistent nature of this patient\\'s problem al-\\nlows me to rule out transient phenomena such as urti-\\ncaria and angioedema from the outset.

The absence of scarring, epidermal at-\\nrophy, or other evidence of superficial cutaneous in-\\nvolvement rules out two rare but important diseases\\nthat otherwise would merit consideration\\nnecrobi-\\notic xanthogranuloma and the form of cutaneous tu-\\nberculosis known as lupus vulgaris.\\nI must assume that the neurologic findings and the\\nfacial swelling were related, in view of their temporal\\nand anatomical associations. Nevertheless, I shall ig-\\nnore for the moment the existence of the cranial-nerve\\nsigns and exclude several disorders that produce pro-\\ngressive facial swelling reminiscent of this case.\\nRecurrent facial erysipelas may result in persistent\\nlymphedematous swelling of the affected part.

The skin-biopsy findings\\nconsist of perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes ad-\\nmixed with small numbers of eosinophils. I shall ex-\\nclude that diagnosis on the basis of the absence of\\ntissue or peripheral eosinophilia in this case. Cheilitis\\nglandularis apostematosat is characterized by inflam-\\nmation and hypertrophy of the minor salivary glands\\nin the lower lip. Mildly tender, chronic lip swelling\\nresults, but involvement of the upper lip and buccal\\nmucosa does not occur. Ascher\\'s syndromes is analo-\\ngous to cheilitis glandularis apostematosa but affects\\nthe upper lip, producing nodular submucosal swell-\\ning, as in the case under discussion. However, the\\ndiagnosis of Ascher\\'s syndrome requires the finding of\\nblepharochalasis, which is not mentioned in the case\\nrecord. Furthermore, inflammation of the accessory\\nlacrimal glands and thyromegaly are frequently en-\\ncountered in that disease and were likewise absent in\\nthis case. Finally, Crohn\\'s disease involving the oral\\nmucosa may result in progressive rubbery swelling of\\nthe buccal surfaces or the lips, or both. On histolog-\\nic examination noncaseating granulomas are seen in\\nthe submucosa. Isolated nodular lip enlargement in\\nCrohn\\'s disease is referred to as \"granulomatous chei-\\nlitis.\" Granulomatous cheilitis is infrequently the pre-\\nsenting manifestation of Crohn\\'s disease, but in one\\nreported case it preceded the diagnosis of perianal and\\ncolonic disease by seven years. The histologic findings\\nof granulomatous cheilitis associated with Crohn\\'s\\ndisease are essentially identical to those of idiopathic\\ngranulomatous cheilitis known as Miescher\\'s cheilitis\\nand the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, which I\\nshall discuss later. However, orolabial Crohn\\'s disease\\ndoes not cause facial weakness or anesthesia, and I do\\nnot believe that this patient had Crohn\\'s disease.\\nI shall consider now the causes of solid facial swell-\\ning that may also result in cranial-nerve injury.\\nAround the world, the most common disorder that\\nmight present with these findings is leprosy. Leproma-\\ntous leprosy and borderline leprosy are two forms of\\nthe disease that produce nodular thickening of the\\nskin. Another form, diffuse lepromatous leprosy, re-\\nsults in diffuse facial swelling that resembles myxede-\\nma. Lepromatous leprosy is unlikely in this case,\\nhowever, in view of the asymmetric and localized na-\\nture of the facial swelling. Borderline leprosy, on the\\nother hand, produces solitary or regional skin lesions.\\nLeprosy could result in this man\\'s cranial-nerve signs.\\nIt often damages the facial nerve, most frequently its\\ntemporal and zygomatic branches. Involvement of the\\nbuccal and mandibular branches, which would have\\nto be implicated in the case under discussion, how-\\never, is much less common.\" Trigeminal-nerve injury\\nresulting from leprosy causes facial anesthesia, as in\\nthis case. It is important to note, though, that the\\nnodular lesions of the lips and cheek should be anes-\\nthetic because of the granulomatous destruction of\\nsensory-nerve branches within the nodules. Therefore,\\nthe slight tenderness of the nodules on two occasions\\nin this patient militates strongly against the diagno-\\nsis of leprosy. We are told that the patient had not\\ntraveled outside the United States. Leprosy is en-\\ndemic in one region of the United States, but unless\\nI learn subsequently that he had lived in southwest-\\nern Louisiana I shall discard leprosy as a diagnostic\\npossibility.\\nSarcoidosis deserves careful consideration in this\\ncase, principally because it may cause asymmetric\\nsubacute or chronic cranial-nerve involvement. Either\\na single cranial nerve, usually the facial nerve, or mul-\\ntiple nerves may be affected. Sarcoidosis frequently\\ninvolves the skin as well. I doubt that this diagnosis\\ncould explain the findings in this patient, because the\\ninduration in this case involved the subcutaneous and\\nsubmucosal tissue, not the skin or mucosa. Subcutane-\\nous sarcoidosis is uncommon and typically presents\\nas nodules in the extremities. I would expect sarcoidal\\ngranulomas in the relatively thin tissue of the cheek\\nand lips, in particular, to involve the overlying skin,\\nproducing characteristic shiny, purple-red nodules.\\nNo such skin lesions are described in this case, and\\nthree biopsies failed to reveal sarcoidal granulomas in\\nthe superficial subcutaneous or submucosal connec-\\ntive tissue. Heerfordt\\'s syndrome, or uveoparotid fe-\\nver, is a presentation of sarcoidosis associated with\\nfacial swelling and facial-nerve palsy, but the swelling\\nis preauricular, occurring along with parotid enlarge-\\nment, uveitis, and fever. At no point in this patient\\'s\\nhistory is there mention of fever, ocular symptoms, or\\nparotid enlargement, and he clearly did not have\\nHeerfordt\\'s syndrome. The normal x-ray films of the\\nchest also suggest that sarcoidosis is not the correct\\ndiagnosis.\\nFinally, I shall discuss four disorders that come\\nclosest to explaining the features of this case - lym-\\nphomatoid granulomatosis, Wegener\\'s granulomato-\\nsis, lymphomas, including so-called centrofacial ma-\\nlignant granuloma, and the Melkersson-Rosenthal\\nsyndrome. Each may produce facial swelling or nodu-\\nlar subcutaneous lesions, and each may damage crani-\\nal nerves.\\nLymphomatoid granulomatosis is a lymphoma-like\\nmultisystem disease that may result in chronic, pro-\\ngressive nodular swelling of the skin and rarely cranial\\nneuropathy. Biopsy of involved skin or subcutaneous\\ntissue reveals an infiltrate of large, atypical-appearing\\nlymphocytes. The absence of constitutional symptoms\\nor signs in this patient virtually eliminates this dis-\\norder as a diagnostic possibility, however. Persons\\nwith this disease are typically very ill, with weight loss,\\nfever, malaise, myalgias, arthralgias, and respiratory\\nsymptoms dominating the clinical picture. X-ray films\\nof the chest usually reveal bilateral pulmonary nod-\\nules, whereas a radiologic study of the chest was nega-\\ntive in this case.\\nWegener\\'s granulomatosis also may present with\\nunilateral cranial neuropathy and occasionally pro-\\nduces subcutaneous nodules. Could this patient have\\nhad a limited form of Wegener\\'s granulomatosis?\\nEven in a limited form of Wegener\\'s granulomato-\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on August 3, 2025.\\nCopyright © 1993 Massachusetts Medical Society.

Further-\\nmore, the extensive induration of subcutaneous tissue,\\nas seen in this case, would almost invariably eventuate\\nin infarction and ulceration of the overlying skin if it\\nwas caused by Wegener\\'s granulomatosis.\\nLocalized lymphoma arising in the face is not un-\\nusual, with as many as 2 to 10 percent of all lympho-\\nmas presenting in the oral cavity. 12 Orofacial lympho-\\nmas present most often as progressive infiltration of\\nthe tongue, lips, palate, or nasal structures, frequently\\nwith eventual ulceration. Sensory disturbances due to\\nnerve destruction may occur, but damage to the facial\\nnerve is rare. Facial swelling and cranial-nerve de-\\nstruction also occur in some patients with centrofacial\\nmalignant granuloma, sometimes called \"destructive\\nmidline granuloma.\" 13 Recent lymphocyte immuno-\\nphenotyping studies and analysis of T-cell-receptor\\ngene rearrangements have suggested that this disorder\\nis probably a T-cell lymphoma. 13,14 Biopsy of affected\\ntissue shows necrosis and large, atypical lymphocytes,\\nas in the first biopsy specimen in this case. The princi-\\npal arguments against either typical lymphoma or\\ncentrofacial malignant granuloma in the case under\\ndiscussion are the negative lymphocyte immunophe-\\nnotyping studies and the indolent nature of the dis-\\nease, with no history of ulceration, bone destruction,\\npain, or systemic illness.\\nThe association of idiopathic solid facial swelling\\nand facial-nerve palsy as a unique disorder was first\\ndescribed by Melkersson.15 Rosenthal16 later reported\\nthe additional association of that condition with lin-\\ngua plicata, or fissured tongue, thus creating the triad\\nnow known as the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome.\\nThe complete syndrome of progressive facial swelling,\\nfacial paralysis, and lingua plicata is seen in only 25\\npercent of the patients, 17 principally because a fis-\\nsured tongue occurs in only 20 to 50 percent of\\nthem. 17,18 Orofacial swelling is the sine qua non of the\\nMelkersson-Rosenthal syndrome; it precedes the oth-\\ner features of the syndrome in approximately 40 per-\\ncent of the cases. 17 The syndrome has no racial or\\nsexual predilection.19 The mean age at onset in one\\nseries of 36 cases from the Mayo Clinic¹¹ was 33.2\\nyears, with a range of 11 to 64 years. The syndrome is\\ngenerally thought to be more common in Europe than\\nin North America and indeed is considered rare on\\nthis side of the Atlantic Ocean. A paucity of case\\nreports from other parts of the world suggests that the\\nsyndrome may be even more unusual elsewhere.\\nThe characteristic facial swelling most common-\\nly affects the upper lip, with lower-lip and buccal\\nswelling occurring almost as frequently. More exten-\\nsive facial swelling, usually unilaterally involving the\\ncheek or infraorbital tissue, is sometimes encountered,\\nas is nodular swelling of the gingivae, palate, or\\ntongue.17 Bouts of swelling that resolve after days or\\nJune 3, 1993\\nweeks initially characterize the disease in about 60\\npercent of the patients, but the episodes gradually give\\nway to fixed facial edema in most cases. 20 Facial pa-\\nralysis indistinguishable from idiopathic Bell\\'s palsy\\noccurs in 50 to 90 percent of the cases. 17,20 Like the\\nswelling, paralysis may be episodic initially, some-\\ntimes involving first one side of the face and then\\nthe other. Simultaneous bilateral facial paralysis is\\napparently rare, however. Defects of taste sensation\\nin the anterior two thirds of the tongue, referable\\nto involvement of the lingual nerve, are frequent-\\nly reported by the patients.17 Noteworthy in consid-\\neration of the case under discussion is the occasion-\\nal involvement of other cranial nerves, particularly\\nthe trigeminal nerve, in the Melkersson-Rosenthal\\nsyndrome. A spectrum of sensory disturbances of\\nthe face, including trigeminal neuralgia, paresthesias,\\nand anesthesia, has been described. 21 Dysfunction of\\nthe second and third cranial nerves as well as auto-\\nnomic disturbances has also been reported. The prog-\\nnosis for neurologic abnormalities in the Melkers-\\nson-Rosenthal syndrome is exceedingly variable. The\\nfacial paralysis usually resolves without sequelae,\\nbut the neuropathy may persist or recur for years.\\nLingua plicata, or fissured tongue, is the least constant\\nand least important component of the triad that con-\\nstitutes this syndrome. 17 The deep grooves on the dor-\\nsal surface of the tongue radiate from a longitudinal\\nfissure in the midline. I should point out that a fis-\\nsured tongue occurs in 5 percent of the population 22\\nand is thus considered a normal variant in the major-\\nity of the cases. With the exception of a mild lym-\\nphocytosis or minimal elevation of the sedimentation\\nrate, both of which are found in only a minority of\\nthe patients, 17 the laboratory evaluation is typically\\nnegative.\\nI believe that the case under discussion is an exam-\\nple of the Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. The clin-\\nical presentation, including the absence of an associat-\\ned systemic illness, is typical of this disorder, and the\\npatient\\'s age, although a bit younger than the mean\\nage at onset, is certainly well within the general age\\nrange for this syndrome. That no mention was made\\nof lingua plicata in the case history means little, since\\nthe fissured tongue is encountered in only a minority\\nof the patients. The findings in the three biopsy speci-\\nmens are consistent with the diagnosis in the sense\\nthat the microscopical findings in an early phase of the\\nMelkersson-Rosenthal syndrome are nonspecific. Ini-\\ntially, lymphohistiocytic infiltration about vessels and\\nwithin the submucosal and subcutaneous tissue may\\nbe the only abnormality encountered. As the orofacial\\ninduration progresses, however, small, noncaseating\\ngranulomas form, frequently within the lumens of\\nlymphatics. 17,23,24 Lymphocytic atypia is not a feature\\nof the syndrome, nor are necrosis and hemorrhage, as\\ndescribed in the first specimen. These findings might\\nfavor another diagnosis, such as lymphomatoid granu-\\nlomatosis, lymphoma, or Wegener\\'s granulomatosis,\\nbut the overall clinical picture does not fit those dis-\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on August 3, 2025.\\nCopyright © 1993 Massachusetts Medical Society.

His-\\ntiocytes with bland nuclear features surrounded de-\\ngenerating fat cells, but no granulomas were identi-\\nfied. On the basis of routine histologic examination\\nthe lesion would be classified as malignant lympho-\\nma, diffuse mixed small-cell and large-cell type, in\\nthe Working Formulation. 25 We also performed im-\\nmunoperoxidase staining of frozen sections to ascer-\\ntain the lineage of the lymphoma. Staining was nega-\\ntive for B-cell-associated antigens. The tumor cells\\nwere CD3 (pan T-cell)-positive. They were also posi-\\ntive for CD7, a marker found on most T cells but\\nusually not expressed by the neoplastic cells of myco-\\nsis fungoides. Staining was negative for another T-cell\\nantigen, CD5. The loss of a pan-T-cell antigen indi-\\ncates that the cells have an abnormal immunopheno-\\ntype and supports the diagnosis of lymphoma. Most\\nof the cells were of the cytotoxic-suppressor type\\n(CD8), and there was background staining with an\\nantibody for T helper (CD4) cells. Thus, our diagno-\\nsis was malignant lymphoma, diffuse mixed small-\\ncell and large-cell type, of T-cell cytotoxic-suppres-\\nsor type.\\nA review of the first biopsy specimen showed a simi-\\nlar infiltrate. In addition, this specimen contained\\nareas of necrosis and infiltration of several blood ves-\\nsels by atypical lymphoid cells (Fig. 4), which in our\\nopinion warrants a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma.\\nPerhaps the results of the DNA studies, which did not\\nsupport a diagnosis of malignant lymphoma, reflected\\na sampling artifact, as the histologically negative biop-\\nsy specimens may have, as well.\\nT-cell lymphomas of a variety of types, includ-\\ning mycosis fungoides, adult T-cell lymphoma asso-\\nciated with type I human T-cell lymphotropic virus,\\nangiocentric lymphoma, and other types of peripher-\\nal T-cell lymphoma, are characterized by frequent\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on August 3, 2025.\\nCopyright © 1993 Massachusetts Medical Society.

Microscopical examination\\nof a biopsy specimen of the bone marrow disclosed a\\nscanty specimen with a slight increase in erythroid\\ncells, some of which showed megaloblastic change; the\\nfindings were considered nondiagnostic. A tuberculin\\nskin test (PPD, 5 TU) was negative, and skin tests\\nwith mumps and candida antigens were positive.\\nSpecimens of blood and urine were obtained for\\nculture. Lovastatin and lisinopril were discontinued;\\nfluids were administered by vein, and acetaminophen\\nwas given by mouth as needed. The temperature rose\\nno higher than 37.8°C on one occasion during the next\\nthree days, although it was slightly higher than 37°C\\non most occasions.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. LEONARD C. MARCUS*: This elderly man had a\\nfebrile illness characterized by headache, fatigue, and\\nrecurrent myalgias. He had shaking chills, and I as-\\nsume that a shaking chill caused his difficulty in using\\na key. The physical examination did not reveal an\\nintention tremor. The laboratory studies showed a\\nnormocytic anemia, reticulocytosis, a depressed hap-\\ntoglobin level, and excess urobilinogen in his urine,\\nindicating that he had hemolytic anemia. Although\\nthe bone marrow biopsy was nondiagnostic, the in-\\ncreased erythropoiesis and megaloblastic changes sug-\\ngest a regenerative process. The white-cell count and\\nplatelets were in the low-normal range, with a relative\\nmonocytosis. The elevated sedimentation rate is com-\\npatible with an inflammatory disease, and the elevat-\\ned globulin level suggests an infectious cause. The\\nmoderately elevated aspartate aminotransferase and\\nlactate dehydrogenase levels are compatible with ei-\\nther primary liver disease or hemolytic disease, which\\ncan be associated with secondary hepatic problems.\\nThus, the clinical and laboratory findings strongly\\nsuggest a hemolytic disease of infectious origin.\\nThe patient\\'s history of eating seafood is irrelevant,\\nespecially if the food was cooked. Proper cooking of\\nseafood destroys all infectious agents, including para-\\nsites, but not heat-stable toxins, such as ciguatera tox-\\nin. The only seafood-borne disease that fits part of the\\nclinical picture is hepatitis A. However, unless there\\nwas a dual infection, the evidence pointing toward a\\nhemolytic disorder as the primary problem rules out\\nthis condition.\\nThe patient\\'s sexual activity with multiple part-\\nners could have resulted in several diseases. The\\nacceptance of his donated blood 18 months earlier\\nindicates that at least at that time there was no labo-\\nratory evidence of infection with human immunode-\\nficiency virus, hepatitis B, or syphilis. It is unlikely\\nthat any sexually transmitted disease was the cause of\\nhis illness.\\nHis work involved interstate travel, which may have\\nbrought him to the Midwest, where histoplasmosis is\\n*Consultant in parasitology, travelers\\' health, and zoonoses, Newton, Mass.\\nendemic, or to the Southwest, where he could have\\ncontracted coccidioidomycosis. Either of these fungal\\ninfections could account for the inactive granuloma-\\ntous disease found on x-ray films of the chest. The\\nnegative tuberculin skin test and the absence of an-\\nergy indicate that he did not have tuberculosis. Any of\\nthese granulomatous diseases can involve the liver,\\nbut none of them are likely to result in hemolysis.\\nOne drug that the patient was taking, lovastatin,\\ncan cause elevation of the hepatic aminotransferase\\nlevel and can rarely cause hemolytic anemia, accord-\\ning to the package insert. A drug reaction, however, is\\nan improbable cause of hyperglobulinemia. Lovasta-\\ntin can result in elevation of the creatine kinase level,\\nnot found in this case. We are not told of any exposure\\nto chemicals or other drugs likely to result in hemoly-\\nsis, and we have no evidence that he was genetically\\npredisposed to hemolysis (e.g., because of glucose-\\n6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency).\\nHe may have had a broken tooth around the time of\\nonset of the illness, but no such damage was noted on\\nthe physical examination. Dental problems, especially\\nthose with gingival injury, can result in bacteremia\\nand subacute bacterial endocarditis, which in turn can\\nbe associated with hemolysis. However, no evidence\\nof sepsis or cardiac abnormalities was found on phys-\\nical examination.\\nThe most intriguing aspect of the patient\\'s history is\\nthe visit to his home on Nantucket, where he worked\\nin his garden and received insect bites but saw no\\nticks. Ixodes dammini is a prevalent tick, and the two\\ndiseases that it transmits, Lyme disease and bab-\\nesiosis, are highly endemic on that island. 1,2 In fact,\\nduring the 1970s babesiosis was locally referred to\\nas \"Nantucket fever.\" Usually, the nymph stage of\\nI. dammini transmits Lyme disease and babesiosis.3\\nThe nymph is less than 3 mm long when fully en-\\ngorged. Most persons who acquire these infections do\\nnot recall a tick bite.\\nThe main focus of babesiosis in the United States is\\nin the Northeast, with a much smaller focus in Wis-\\nconsin. The pathogen is Babesia microti, an intraeryth-\\nrocytic parasite that is naturally found in small mam-\\nmals, such as the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus\\nleucopus) and the vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus). The lar-\\nval tick acquires the infection from the animal and\\ntransmits the parasite transtadially from the nymph to\\nthe adult stages. About 40 percent of I. dammini\\nnymphs on Nantucket have sporozoites (the infective\\nstage) in their salivary glands in June. After an\\ninfected nymph bites someone, the organisms enter\\nthe host\\'s red cells, where they multiply and cause\\nhemolysis.\\nThis patient became ill 312 weeks after working in\\nhis garden. The incubation period for babesiosis is\\nusually one to four weeks, but it can be longer. The\\ndate at the onset of the illness is typical of B. microti\\ninfections in New England, which peak in July. Babe-\\nsiosis can also be transmitted by transfusion. 3,7,8 Per-\\nsons with a history of babesiosis are not accepted as\\nblood donors by the American Red Cross.9\\nSymptoms of babesiosis include fever, shaking\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

The urinalysis on admission was not posi-\\ntive for blood, but the urine contained urobilinogen.\\nBabesiosis tends to be more severe in adults who are\\nmiddle-aged or older, although it may be underdiag-\\nnosed in children.¹¹ This patient\\'s age falls in the usual\\nrange. 2,3 Splenomegaly is found in less than half the\\npatients; it was not found in this patient. In some of\\nthe earliest reported cases of human babesiosis it oc-\\ncurred in asplenic persons in Europe who had a fatal\\ninfection with B. divergens, a parasite of cattle. 12 The\\nbilirubin level is slightly elevated in about half the\\ncases of babesiosis; it was normal in this case, presum-\\nably because the liver function was adequate to me-\\ntabolize the products of hemoglobin breakdown.\\nBecause both Lyme disease and babesiosis are\\ntransmitted by the same vector, they may be found\\nconcurrently in the same person. The first reported\\nfatal case of Lyme disease occurred in a patient with\\nintercurrent babesiosis. 13 The patient under discus-\\nsion had no history of a skin rash or joint, cardiac, or\\nneurologic problems compatible with Lyme disease. A\\nnegative serologic test for Lyme borreliosis would fur-\\nther rule out intercurrent infection.\\nAnother tick-borne infection that has many clinical\\nand laboratory manifestations similar to those of bab-\\nesiosis is ehrlichiosis, caused by rickettsia of the genus\\nehrlichia. The tick vector for human beings is not\\nknown. There is serologic evidence that this infection\\noccurs in coastal New England. 14 Ehrlichiosis is char-\\nacterized by fever, malaise, myalgias, variable throm-\\nbocytopenia, and moderately abnormal results of liv-\\ner-function tests. Splenomegaly and a rash may be\\npresent but are not common. A diagnostic inclusion\\nbody can be seen rarely in circulating lymphocytes.\\nThe diagnosis is usually established by serologic test-\\ning. 15,16\\nTularemia is another arthropod-borne infection\\nthat occurs on Nantucket. The typhoidal form of the\\ndisease causes fever and produces abnormal results on\\nliver-function tests but is not associated with hemoly-\\nsis. Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which occurs in\\ncoastal Massachusetts, and murine typhus, which the\\npatient could have encountered in his interstate travel,\\nare rickettsial infections that can cause fever and some\\nhematologic and blood chemical changes similar to\\nthose found in this patient. These diseases are usually\\ncharacterized by a skin rash and headache and are not\\ntypically associated with hemolysis.\\nIn summary, this patient had acute-to-subacute\\nhemolytic anemia, probably due to infection and most\\nlikely caused by B. microti. The diagnosis of babesiosis\\nis definitively established by demonstrating the in-\\ntraerythrocytic organism in peripheral-blood smears.\\nIf the level of parasitemia is low, the organism is best\\ndemonstrated in thick smears. The organism can also\\nbe demonstrated by inoculating the patient\\'s blood\\nintraperitoneally into a suitable laboratory host, such\\nJuly 15, 1993\\nas a hamster, and examining that animal\\'s blood for\\nthe infection weekly one to six weeks after inocula-\\ntion.³ Babesiosis can be diagnosed serologically with\\nan indirect fluorescent-antibody test. A single titer\\nequal to or greater than 1:1024 is strongly suggestive\\nof the infection, if not diagnostic of it. The serologic\\ndiagnosis can also be established by a fourfold or\\ngreater rise in the serum titer between the acute phase\\nand the convalescent phase.\\nBabesiosis is treated with clindamycin and quinine\\nsulfate. 17 The prognosis is good in patients with intact,\\nfunctioning spleens and no other serious intercurrent\\ndisease. Life-threatening infections can be treated\\nwith exchange transfusions.8\\nDR. WILLIAM S. BECK: I am struck by the notably\\ndeleterious effect of asplenia in this disorder. Is there\\nanything unusual about the role of the spleen in this\\ndisease?\\nDR. MARCUS: The spleen serves as a clearinghouse\\nfor sequestration and removal of damaged (e.g., para-\\nsitized) red cells, besides providing mechanical filtra-\\ntion. It is an important site of antigen processing for\\ncellular and humoral immunity. In animals, splenec-\\ntomy causes a prolonged parasitemia or increased se-\\nverity of disease, or both, in many different intraeryth-\\nrocytic infections.\\nDr. Donald M. LLOYD-JONES: This patient had\\ntraveled widely, especially in the Midwest, including\\nweekly trips to St. Louis and the Ohio River valley on\\nbusiness, and he did have a remote history of histo-\\nplasmosis, which accounts for the granulomatous dis-\\nease shown on the x-ray films of the chest.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nBabesiosis.\\nDR. LEONARD C. MARCUS\\' DIAGNOSIS\\nBabesiosis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. ANTHONY R. MATTIA: The diagnostic pro-\\ncedure was the preparation and interpretation of\\nGiemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears in the\\nparasitology laboratory. Examination of the thick\\nsmears revealed multiple tiny piriform and ring-\\nshaped organisms, each appearing as a dark-red chro-\\nmatin dot surrounded by a wisp of blue cytoplasm.\\nOn the thin smears the parasites appeared predomi-\\nnantly as small ring trophozoites within red cells of\\nnormal size (Fig. 1); the level of parasitemia was less\\nthan 1 percent. The presence of rare dividing organ-\\nisms in a characteristic tetrad formation was diagnos-\\ntic of babesia infection (Fig. 2).\\nHuman babesiosis is a zoonotic illness resembling\\nmalaria caused by an intraerythrocytic protozoan,\\nmost frequently B. microti, that is transmitted by\\nI. dammini ticks 18,19 or rarely by blood transfusion. 20,21\\nB. microti is endemic in a circumscribed geograph-\\nic area of the northeastern coastal United States,\\nparticularly the islands off the southern New Eng-\\nland coast (including Nantucket, Martha\\'s Vineyard,\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

The greatest risk of transmission of the parasite\\nfrom the feeding nymphal tick is in May and June,\\nwhich correlates with the peak incidence of disease in\\nJuly. Human beings become infected when they in-\\ntrude into the natural cycle. Once the organism has\\nbeen introduced into the bloodstream by the tick, it\\ninvades erythrocytes and multiplies by binary fission\\nto produce four merozoites (the tetrad form), and\\nthereafter the cells lyse, liberating merozoites to infect\\nother erythrocytes. There is no apparent periodicity in\\nthe parasitemia or associated clinical symptoms, in\\ncontrast to some cases of malaria.\\nClinically evident babesiosis is more frequent\\namong persons over 40 years of age and those with-\\nout a functioning spleen. 24-26 The infection is self-\\nlimited, although parasitemia, which is generally low,\\nmay persist for weeks or months in untreated pa-\\ntients. 21,22,27 Signs of hemolysis are common, and\\nthrombocytopenia of unknown cause is a frequent\\nfinding. 24 In asplenic patients the level of parasi-\\ntemia can reach as high as 80 to 90 percent, caus-\\ning more severe disease, which often requires ex-\\nchange transfusion. 8,26,28 Also, a report of babesiosis in\\na patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syn-\\ndrome suggests that recurrent disease requiring pro-\\nlonged therapy may be more likely in persons with this\\ndisease.29\\nThe laboratory diagnosis of babesiosis generally re-\\nquires direct observation of parasites in Giemsa-\\nstained peripheral-blood smears. 24,28,30-32 Trophozoites\\nappear predominantly as small ring forms within\\nerythrocytes of normal size, resembling the early rings\\nof Plasmodium falciparum. Tetrad merozoites are a diag-\\nnostic feature but are infrequent. Other forms, such as\\nimmature piriform bodies and more mature trophozo-\\nites, may also be seen. Extracellular organisms can\\nappear singly or in clumps. The differential diagnosis\\nfrom malaria, particularly malaria due to P. falciparum,\\nis facilitated by the clinical history as well as the ab-\\nsence of gametocytes and hemozoin in the blood\\nsmears of patients with babesiosis. Close communica-\\ntion between the laboratory parasitologist and the cli-\\nnician is paramount in difficult cases. Since the parasi-\\ntemia is usually low-level, multiple smears obtained\\nover several days may be necessary to demonstrate the\\norganisms. Diagnostic pitfalls include nonparasitic\\nred-cell inclusions, such as Pappenheimer bodies,\\nwhich occur in the peripheral blood of asplenic pa-\\ntients. 33\\nSerologic testing for elevated levels of IgM or IgG\\nantibodies (or both) to babesia is available through\\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and\\nsome research laboratories with the use of indirect\\nimmunofluorescence.34 Such testing has been helpful\\nin epidemiologic studies but thus far has had a limited\\nrole in the diagnosis of individual cases. High titers\\nare indicative of recent infection, and low-titer cross-\\nreactivity can be seen in hosts with infection due to\\nother babesia species, malaria, and certain other tick-\\nborne infections. Intraperitoneal inoculation of blood\\ninto hamsters may be helpful in cases in which the\\norganisms are suspected but difficult to detect by re-\\npeated blood smears, but this approach is generally\\nimpractical for routine diagnostic use. Parasitemia\\nusually is apparent in the animals\\' blood in two to four\\nweeks. 35 Also, a recently described method of DNA\\namplification with use of the polymerase chain reac-\\ntion may provide an adjunct to conventional meth-\\nods of diagnosis or epidemiologic surveillance in the\\nfuture. 30\\nIn our laboratory we have noted that in this case\\nand others, organisms can be demonstrated with use\\nof the quantitative buffy coat technique (QBC, Becton\\nDickinson, Tropical Disease Diagnostics Division,\\nSparks, Md.), a method originally developed for the\\ndiagnosis of malaria. 36,37 This rapid technique uses\\nmicrohematocrit capillary tubes coated with acridine\\norange, centrifugation, and visualization under fluo-\\nrescence epi-illumination.

A sub-\\nsequent antibody-capture assay (Imugen, Norwood,\\nMass.) performed on the same serum specimen re-\\nvealed an elevated IgM antibody titer. The result\\nof the IgG immunoblot analysis (Imugen) was below\\nthe threshold for seropositivity. These results are\\ncompatible with recent borrelia infection and sug-\\ngest that the two infections were acquired simul-\\ntaneously in this patient, although there were no\\napparent clinical signs of Lyme disease. Up to 40\\npercent of ticks in regions where this disorder is en-\\ndemic can be coinfected. 23,39 In addition, serologic\\nstudies of selected groups of persons in such areas\\nhave demonstrated seropositivity for both B. microti\\nand Borr. burgdorferi in 10 to 66 percent. 23,40 Therefore,\\nit is recommended that the possibility of coinfection be\\ninvestigated in patients presenting with either dis-\\norder. 39\\nIn summary, this patient had babesiosis and sero-\\nlogic evidence of concurrent Borr. burgdorferi infection.\\nDR. ROBERT E. SCULLY: Dr. Swerdlow, will you tell\\nus about the management of the patient\\'s care?\\nDR. DAVID L. SWERDLOw: Patients with babesiosis\\nhave been treated successfully with a combination of\\nclindamycin and quinine for seven days. Seriously ill\\npatients, usually those who are asplenic, may need\\nexchange transfusions. This patient had been afebrile\\nfor several days and was feeling well. Most patients\\nwith a functioning spleen have a mild or subclinical\\nillness and recover without specific therapy, as sup-\\nported by the high prevalence of seropositivity of 4 to\\n7 percent among residents of areas with endemic dis-\\nease, such as Nantucket. This information and the\\noption of receiving clindamycin and quinine were dis-\\ncussed with the patient and his physician, and he was\\ndischarged. Three weeks after discharge folic acid was\\nprescribed because of persistent anemia. A follow-up\\nhematocrit about two months after discharge was 41.3\\npercent.\\nSeveral cases of babesiosis have recently been seen\\nin Boston hospitals. We contacted the state health de-\\npartment to determine whether these cases were part\\nof a larger outbreak. As of November 1992, 11 cases\\nwere reported; 10 cases had been reported in 1991. In\\ncontrast, only about two cases a year had been report-\\ned in the preceding four years. Some of this increase in\\nthe number of reported cases during the past two\\nyears may have been due to an increased surveillance\\nby the state health department.\\nDR. SCULLY: Dr. Levine, how is the patient now?\\nDr. Barry W. LEVINE: Although no therapy for\\nbabesiosis was administered, he received an appropri-\\nate course of doxycycline for the Lyme infection since\\nit was acute. He is now asymptomatic, without ar-\\nthralgia or rash compatible with active Lyme disease.\\nDR. PETER A. MERKEL: Should patients with asple-\\nnia avoid areas where babesiosis is endemic?\\nJuly 15, 1993\\nDR. MARCUS: They should not go to areas where the\\nticks are abundant. If they stay in the towns or in their\\ncars they are not at risk. Also, the use of insect repel-\\nlents and protective clothing and tucking pants into\\nboot tops or socks greatly reduce the risk of exposure\\nto ticks.\\nDR. BECK: There is a well known relation between\\nsickle cell anemia and malaria. Sickle cell anemia is\\nthought to benefit patients with malaria. I recall once\\nhearing Linus Pauling offer a facetious explanation.\\nHe suggested that when red cells sickle they break the\\nnecks of the malarial parasites and in that way kill\\nthem. Is there any such relation between sickle cell\\nanemia and babesiosis?\\nDR. MARCUS: I am not aware of any study of a\\nrelation between those diseases or of reports of empiri-\\ncal observations on that question. Sickle cell trait pro-\\nvides partial protection against falciparum malaria,\\nbut paradoxically one of the major causes of sickle cell\\ncrisis in Africa is falciparum malaria.\\nDR. BECK: It seems possible that when parasites\\nwithin red cells consume oxygen, they are likely\\nto convert the oxyhemoglobin to deoxyhemoglobin.\\nIf the hemoglobin is hemoglobin S, deoxygenation\\nwould tend to cause the red cells to sickle, and the\\nparasite-containing red cells would probably be de-\\nstroyed, parasite and all, in the microvasculature. If\\nthat is what happens in malaria, perhaps it might also\\nhappen in babesiosis.\\n',\n",
       " 'Vol. 329 No. 6\\nCLINICAL PROBLEM-SOLVING\\nKREISBERG\\n413\\nCLINICAL PROBLEM-SOLVING\\nIn this Journal feature, information about a real patient is\\npresented in stages (boldface type) to an expert clinician, who\\nresponds to the information, sharing his reasoning with the\\nreader (regular type). The author\\'s commentary follows.\\nAN ABUNDANCE OF OPTIONS\\nROBERT A. KREISBERG, M.D.\\nA 33-year-old rancher and outdoorsman report-\\ned four days of fever, low back pain, arthralgia,\\nand myalgia. Two days before admission to the\\nhospital, headache, nausea, vomiting, and fever\\n(temperature, 39.7°C) developed.\\nOne of the most important first steps in approach-\\ning a patient is to frame the problem that is, to\\ndefine it in terms of either a diagnosis or a syndrome\\nand then to think about it both pathophysiologically\\nand probabilistically. With this patient, I would frame\\nthe problem as an acute undifferentiated fever syn-\\ndrome. The chief problem is fever of a few days\\' dura-\\ntion. There is nothing pointing to any particular part\\nof the body or to any organ system, but the fever could\\nbe caused by a disseminated infectious process. The\\nhistory has some intriguing parts. The fact that the\\npatient is a rancher and an outdoorsman may be help-\\nful later as we begin to think about the probability of\\nvarious diseases. I am most worried about a dissemi-\\nnated bacterial infection, and I look forward to hear-\\ning more about the history and physical examination.\\nThe patient had gonorrhea at the age of 21\\nyears and a rattlesnake bite at the age of 33. He\\nhas used recreational drugs both orally and intra-\\nvenously, traveled recently in California, and was\\nin jail in Utah. He works as a rancher and is in\\ncontact with farm animals and dogs, one of whom\\nwas recently ill. He is an avid hunter and is often\\nexposed to wild animals; he frequently eats wild\\ngame, and he drinks unpasteurized milk regu-\\nlarly.\\nThis part of the history is quite rich in potentially\\nimportant epidemiologic and social tidbits that raise a\\nnumber of diagnostic possibilities. Although I prefer\\nto reason pathophysiologically first and probabilisti-\\ncally later in approaching a diagnostic problem, there\\nare features of this history that obviously suggest dis-\\norders such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\\ninfection, syphilis, brucella, tularemia, leptospirosis,\\nand perhaps even plague. Nevertheless, the causes of\\nthe acute undifferentiated fever syndrome are numer-\\nous, and the cause in his case could certainly be one\\nthat has nothing to do with any of the infectious\\nFrom the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294-\\n0012, where reprint requests should be addressed to Dr. Kreisberg.\\nagents he might have been exposed to. Rather than\\nspeculate further, I would now want the results of the\\nphysical examination, even though it may not be help-\\nful, and some screening laboratory and x-ray studies.\\nThe patient appeared ill. His skin was warm,\\nflushed, and sweaty. Vital signs included blood\\npressure of 114/70 mm Hg, pulse of 90 beats per\\nminute, respiration of 20 per minute, and tem-\\nperature of 39.1°C. The fundi were normal, and\\nthere were no hemorrhages or Roth\\'s spots. His\\nsclerae were not icteric, and there were no con-\\njunctival hemorrhages. There were no oral or\\npharyngeal lesions and no cervical lymphadenop-\\nathy. Bilateral tender, slightly enlarged shotty\\naxillary nodes were present. The lungs were clear\\nin response to percussion and auscultation. An\\nearly grade 2/6 systolic murmur was present at\\nthe base of the heart, with radiation to the left\\nlower sternal border. Tenderness was present in\\nthe right upper quadrant, but neither the liver nor\\nthe spleen was palpable. There were no skin le-\\nsions, but he had subungual splinter hemorrhages\\nthat he attributed to manual labor.\\nAs I suspected, the physical examination is not par-\\nticularly helpful. There are a few intriguing findings:\\nfor example, slightly enlarged axillary nodes, which\\nmay or may not be important; a flow murmur, which I\\nsuspect will not be important; and mild right-upper-\\nquadrant tenderness, which suggests liver involve-\\nment. I suspect that his liver-function results may be\\nabnormal; I doubt, however, that this will be helpful,\\nbecause many microorganisms, as well as circulating\\nimmune complexes, that invade the bloodstream may\\ninvolve the liver and cause a degree of hepatic dys-\\nfunction. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever been helped by subun-\\ngual splinter hemorrhages; I suspect their proposed\\ncause is correct.\\nAll we know so far is that the patient has an acute\\nundifferentiated fever syndrome. I think the most\\nlikely diagnostic possibility is either a systemic gener-\\nalized infection or a primary immunologic disease;\\nthe infection is more probable. In approaching such\\na patient, it is important to consider all possible di-\\nagnoses, but particularly those that are life-threaten-\\ning and for which there is specific treatment. Some\\npatients with acute undifferentiated fever are critical-\\nly ill within a few hours of the onset of symptoms.\\nThese patients usually have overwhelming bactere-\\nmia. The microorganisms most frequently responsible\\nfor such a syndrome include Staphylococcus aureus, group\\nA streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis, and in children,\\nHaemophilus influenzae. With some exposure histories,\\nYersinia pestis, Capnocytophaga canimorsus, and Vibrio vul-\\nnificus should also be considered.

In these cases, microorganisms\\nhave been inoculated through the skin or the respira-\\ntory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tract and have\\nseeded the bloodstream and then gone elsewhere to\\nreplicate. Some organisms, such as the hepatitis vi-\\nruses, target the hepatocyte and replicate there. A few,\\nsuch as plasmodia and babesia, replicate in red cells.\\nStill others, particularly rickettsiae, replicate in endo-\\nthelial cells. But the majority replicate over a period of\\nseveral days in the reticuloendothelial system.\\nAt this point I would suspect infection with a micro-\\norganism that has a propensity to invade the reticulo-\\nendothelial system. There are many such organisms;\\nthey include some of those I referred to earlier and to\\nwhich the patient might have been exposed (HIV,\\nFrancisella tularensis, brucella, and Coxiella burnetii), but\\norganisms such as salmonella and campylobacter can\\nalso do this. Three groups of viruses can cause acute\\nundifferentiated fever syndrome. The first group is as-\\nsociated with mononucleosis syndrome Epstein-Barr\\nvirus, cytomegalovirus, and the hepatitis viruses; the\\nsecond group includes the arboviruses, and in the pa-\\ntient\\'s part of the country Colorado tick fever would\\nbe a consideration; and the third group includes the\\nacute childhood exanthem viruses, but these are very\\nunlikely in an adult.\\nHis white-cell count was 11,000 per cubic mil-\\nlimeter, with 6 percent bands, 71 percent seg-\\nmented polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 14 per-\\ncent lymphocytes, and 8 percent monocytes. His\\nhemoglobin was 17.8 g per deciliter, and his plate-\\nlet count 175,000 per cubic millimeter. The eryth-\\nrocyte sedimentation rate was 15 mm per hour. A\\nchemistry profile was normal except for the fol-\\nlowing: serum phosphate, 1.4 mg per deciliter;\\nuric acid, 2.5 mg per deciliter (below normal for\\nthe laboratory); aspartate aminotransferase, 70 U\\nper liter; and alanine aminotransferase, 187 U\\nper liter. A urinalysis was positive for bile and\\ncontained 1+ protein, with 2 to 5 red cells per\\nhigh-power field and an occasional white cell.\\nBlood cultures obtained by his physician two days\\nbefore admission were reported to be negative.\\nX-ray films of the chest and sinuses were nega-\\ntive. Blood was obtained to measure titers for bru-\\ncellosis, tularemia, leptospirosis, Epstein-Barr\\nvirus infection, HIV infection, Lyme disease,\\nand rickettsial diseases. An abdominal computed\\ntomographic scan suggested retroperitoneal and\\npelvic adenopathy.\\nPart of my personal definition of a fever of unknown\\norigin is that after getting the information from the\\nhistory, physical examination, and initial laboratory\\nstudies I have no idea what is the matter with the\\npatient. This patient certainly fits that bill. As expect-\\ned, the liver-function results are abnormal, although\\nonly mildly so. The hemogram is not especially help-\\nAug. 5, 1993\\nful. He does not have lymphocytosis and probably\\ndoes not have a mononucleosis syndrome. His elevat-\\ned hemoglobin suggests hemoconcentration. The pres-\\nence of retroperitoneal and pelvic adenopathy is not\\nvery helpful, because a number of infectious, immuno-\\nlogic, and neoplastic diseases, particularly lymphoma,\\ncan cause a degree of retroperitoneal and pelvic ad-\\nenopathy. The appropriate serologic titers were meas-\\nured for the disorders I mentioned, and it was appro-\\npriate to include leptospirosis and relapsing fever due\\nto borrelia infection. Borrelia infection could also be\\ndiagnosed by peripheral-blood film. The most intrigu-\\ning laboratory result is the erythrocyte sedimentation\\nrate of 15. I am certain that the patient has an inflam-\\nmatory disorder, although it is not clear whether it is\\nimmunologic or infectious. Almost all such diseases\\ninvolve high sedimentation rates; a peculiar exception\\nis brucellosis. I am not sure why brucellosis is associ-\\nated with a low erythrocyte sedimentation rate, but it\\nis, and I think that that is the only hint I can obtain\\nfrom these results.\\nAt this point it is appropriate to consider whether to\\ninitiate empirical antibiotic therapy. That decision de-\\npends in part on how sick the patient is and on the\\nprobabilities of various diseases. I have the feeling\\nthat the patient is not overwhelmingly sick and is not\\nseptic. Moreover, we know that blood cultures ob-\\ntained 48 hours earlier were sterile, which makes\\nacutely lethal bacterial infection quite unlikely. I\\nwould probably treat him with a tetracycline. That\\nwould cover some of the more likely possibilities, in-\\ncluding brucellosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tu-\\nlaremia, and leptospirosis. I wouldn\\'t perform an in-\\nvasive procedure for example, lymph-node biopsy\\nor bone marrow biopsy at this point, but I don\\'t\\nhave a diagnosis, and if he doesn\\'t improve soon, I\\nwould certainly consider a bone marrow aspirate and\\nbiopsy as the next step.\\nOn the second hospital day nontender erythem-\\natous macular patches appeared bilaterally over\\nthe tibial regions. Several vesicular lesions also\\nappeared on the soft palate. Antibiotic therapy\\nwas initiated with intravenous penicillin G at a\\ndose of 2 million units every four hours and 100\\nmg of doxycycline twice a day.\\nThese are very interesting findings. Perhaps they\\nshould lead me to a specific diagnosis, but they don\\'t.\\nThe patient may have a primary immunologic disease;\\nerythematous macular patches over the tibia raise the\\npossibility of erythema nodosum. Group A streptococ-\\ncal infections are a cause of erythema nodosum, but\\nsore throat has not been a particular complaint of the\\npatient, and vesicular lesions on the soft palate are not\\ncharacteristic of group A streptococcal infection. The\\nleg lesions could also be immunologic consequences of\\na bacteremic illness such as endocarditis. To me, ve-\\nsicular lesions on the soft palate raise two general pos-\\nsibilities: one is vasculitis, and the other is a viral in-\\nVol. 329 No. 6\\nCLINICAL PROBLEM-SOLVING\\nKREISBERG\\n415\\nfection such as primary herpes simplex virus infection,\\nherpangina, or another enteroviral infection. An inter-\\nesting possibility is leptospirosis; pretibial lesions oc-\\ncurred with an outbreak of leptospirosis at Fort Bragg,\\nNorth Carolina. I said earlier that I would have begun\\na tetracycline at the time of presentation, so I certain-\\nly agree with the decision to give the patient doxycy-\\ncline.\\nWithin 36 hours his temperature returned to\\nnormal and he was subjectively and objectively\\nbetter. By the fourth day of therapy he was eating\\nnormally and his rash was resolving. Blood was\\nobtained to measure convalescent serologic titers. These results were not available until after\\nthe patient had recovered and had been dis-\\ncharged from the hospital.\\nI don\\'t have much experience with leptospirosis,\\nbut I believe these serologic changes are diagnostic\\nsince they went from negative to positive in what ap-\\npears to be a reasonably high titer. Given his history,\\nthe patient probably came into contact with the urine\\nof rats, farm animals, and dogs. I suspect that he\\nbecame infected after ingesting material contaminated\\nwith the urine of one of these animals. Leptospirosis\\ncan also be contracted through skin contact with con-\\ntaminated urine.\\nCOMMENTARY\\nAlthough leptospirosis is often tacked onto the dif-\\nferential diagnosis of prolonged unexplained fever,\\nmost physicians never encounter a patient with the\\ndisease, and after a while they may dismiss it entirely\\nas a diagnostic hypothesis. When it is out of sight, it is\\nout of mind; yet in the right geographic setting¹,² and\\nwith the right kind of exposure, adding leptospirosis to\\nthe differential diagnosis is essential.\\nThe leptospiral organism, a gram-negative spiro-\\nchete, is ubiquitous, with a reservoir in rodents,\\nskunks, foxes, domestic livestock, dogs, and frogs.\\nLeptospirosis is associated with the use of water-\\ncatchment systems. The disease is acquired by drink-\\ning surface water, by exposure of skin wounds, by\\ndirect contact with cattle urine, and by the handling of\\nanimal tissues. In areas of endemic disease leptospi-\\nrosis accounts for 5 to 15 percent of the diagnoses in\\npatients with febrile illnesses.¹\\nDiagnosing leptospirosis, or at least suspecting it\\nand treating the patient for it, can be critical: although\\nthe disease is usually self-limiting, in selected series\\nthe mortality rate is as high as 10 percent. The diag-\\nnosis is difficult in the early stages, as it was in this\\npatient, because of the lack of specificity of the clinical\\nsyndrome. Typical symptoms include fever, headache,\\nmyalgias, nausea, and vomiting; it is virtually impos-\\nsible, however, to distinguish patients with leptospiro-\\nsis from those without it on the basis of these present-\\ning symptoms. Sixty to 70 percent of patients who are\\nultimately found to have leptospirosis are at first\\nthought to have some other disorder, and leptospirosis\\nis the initial clinical diagnosis in only 30 percent of the\\ncases. The incubation period is 7 to 14 days, and the\\npresenting symptoms are similar to those in the pa-\\ntient discussed here. Conjunctival suffusion is thought\\nto be an important physical finding, but he did not\\nhave this finding. In about half of the patients the\\ndisease begins very abruptly over a period of one or\\ntwo hours and is associated with fever, a severe retro-\\norbital or occipital headache, severe myalgia, nausea\\nor vomiting, and a temperature of up to 40°C with\\nchills. The disease usually lasts four to nine days and\\nresolves spontaneously. It usually has a monophasic\\ncourse, but in some patients there is a second phase\\nthat lasts two to four days and is usually associated\\nwith meningitis. In the second phase of the disease\\nabnormalities in liver function and microscopic hema-\\nturia are also common. Because the organism is not\\neasily cultured from blood or urine, the diagnosis usu-\\nally has to be established serologically. IgM antibod-\\nies to the leptospiral organism appear in the serum in\\nfour to five days.\\nIt is interesting to reflect on the management of this\\npatient\\'s condition. The discussant aptly considered\\nthe differential diagnosis, but was frustrated not only\\nby the extraordinarily long list of diagnostic possibili-\\nties, given the patient\\'s many possible exposures, but\\nalso by the nonspecific nature of the patient\\'s symp-\\ntoms, physical findings, and laboratory results. He\\nmentioned leptospirosis as one of the diagnostic possi-\\nbilities after learning about the laboratory results, but\\nonly in the context of several other diseases that would\\nrespond to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Both the pa-\\ntient\\'s physician and the discussant decided that even\\nwithout a specific diagnosis, it was time to treat: for\\nboth of them, the risk of not treating appeared greater\\nthan the risk of a few days of tetracycline therapy.\\nLeptospirosis became a more prominent diagnostic\\nchoice only after the discussant learned about the pa-\\ntient\\'s skin lesions. At first he considered the possibil-\\nity of streptococcal infection, endocarditis, or vasculi-\\ntis, but then he recalled that similar skin lesions occur\\nwith a condition he had already mentioned\\nlepto-\\nspirosis. This apparent connection between one clini-\\ncal finding and a specific diagnosis raises the impor-\\ntant question of how physicians ultimately reach a\\ndiagnosis. In this case probabilities might help, be-\\ncause they set the stage, but I suspect that the\\noverwhelming factor was pattern recognition or the\\nrecollection of a similar patient. 3,4 For example, ap-\\nproximately 1 in 2000 patients with insulin-dependent\\ndiabetes mellitus has primary adrenal insufficiency.\\nHowever, one does not have to see 2000 patients with\\ninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus before encoun-\\ntering 1 with adrenal insufficiency.

On the other hand,\\ngeographic variation in disease, perhaps at work here\\nbecause of the rural and outdoor nature of society\\nin this region, dictates more serious consideration\\nof unusual diseases when a patient presents with\\nwhat many physicians would diagnose as an acute\\nviral illness.\\nAnother interesting aspect of arriving at the correct\\ndiagnosis involves the specialty or subspecialty of the\\ndiagnostician. In the case of the patient with amyloid\\nheart disease discussed in an earlier article, the ex-\\npert, a cardiologist, arrived at the correct diagnosis\\nvery late because he ignored the presence of carpal\\ntunnel syndrome, focusing instead on the heart dis-\\nease. I dare say endocrinologists, rheumatologists, or\\nseasoned generalists might have arrived at the diagno-\\nsis more quickly, even though they know less about\\namyloid heart disease, because they are tuned in to\\nthe differential diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.\\nThus, perspective is important, and as Albert Einstein\\nsaid, \"It is the theory which decides what we can ob-\\nserve.\"\\nAdmittedly, I selected a particularly unusual pa-\\ntient for discussion, one with an especially large num-\\nber of possible exposures to uncommon infectious\\nagents. These multiple exposures invoked the large\\nnumber of diagnostic options considered by the dis-\\ncussant. But what are the successful ingredients in\\nthe care of this patient? First, a sufficiently detailed\\nhistory was necessary to ascertain all possible infec-\\ntious exposures. Second, the patient\\'s physician, an\\ninternist in rural Montana, had to know which dis-\\nAug. 5, 1993\\neases were endemic in the areas where the patient had\\ntraveled. Third, it was decided to treat without\\na definitive diagnosis. This decision, as discussed\\nabove, is a function of the net benefit of treating\\nor refraining from treatment, and it often depends\\non the physician\\'s judgment about the patient\\'s sta-\\ntus. Our discussant assessed the patient as \"not over-\\nwhelmingly sick,\" yet he would have treated him, and\\nthe same decision was made by the patient\\'s physi-\\ncian.

       " 'A 36-year-old man with the acquired immunodefi-\\nciency syndrome (AIDS) was admitted to the hospital\\nbecause of increasing dyspnea and respiratory failure.\\nThe patient was homosexual; his companion was\\nknown to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\\nantibodies, without clinically obvious disease. Thirty-\\ntwo months before admission herpetic proctitis devel-\\noped, and a test for HIV antibodies was positive; the\\nCD4+ cell count was 194 per cubic millimeter. Acy-\\nclovir was given, resulting in control of the proctitis.\\nTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis was be-\\ngun, but a rash ensued and dapsone was substituted.\\nSeborrheic dermatitis and thrush developed. During\\nthe next few months a chronic cough appeared, and\\nroentgenograms of the chest showed diffuse, mild in-\\nterstitial disease, with patchy areas of ground-glass\\nand air-space opacities in both lower lobes; the hilar\\nregions, mediastinum, heart, and pleural spaces were\\nnormal. Bronchoalveolar lavage yielded no pathogen-\\nic microorganisms, but a transbronchial biopsy dis-\\nclosed cytomegalovirus infection, without Pneumocystis\\ncarinii. Ganciclovir and immune globulin were given\\nby vein, with improvement. In the same month Kapo-\\nsi\\'s sarcoma lesions were noted on the thorax and hard\\npalate. Twenty-two months before entry, radiographs\\nof the chest were normal. The results of pulmonary-\\nfunction studies are presented in Table 1. Nineteen\\nmonths before admission amebic dysentery developed\\nand was treated with metronidazole. Two months lat-\\ner cytomegalovirus retinitis was discovered and was\\ntreated with ganciclovir. Foscarnet was substituted for\\nganciclovir during a recurrence four months later, and\\nthree recurrences during the ensuing nine months re-\\nquired the administration of both agents.\\nEight months before entry P. carinii pneumonia oc-\\ncurred and radiographs of the chest (Fig. 1) showed patchy areas of ground-glass and coarse reticular\\nopacities in the middle and lower lung zones; atelecta-\\nsis was present in the right middle lobe. Dapsone and\\ntrimethoprim caused a rash with fever, and prima-\\nquine with clindamycin failed to control the pneumo-\\nnia; pentamidine and foscarnet were given by vein.\\nDuring the course of treatment the creatinine rose\\nto 2.2 mg per deciliter (190 µmol per liter). The\\nCD4+ cell count fell to less than 50 per cubic milli-\\nmeter. Didanosine was not administered because of\\nthe presence of peripheral neuropathy. Three and a\\nhalf months before admission zidovudine was ad-\\nministered, and three weeks later severe pharyngitis\\nand agranulocytosis occurred. Radiographs of the\\nchest revealed patchy opacities in both lungs, as\\nwell as areas of prominent interstitial markings; the\\npleural spaces were clear. Ceftazidime, vancomycin,\\nand granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)\\nwere administered, and the neutrophil count rose to\\n1000 per cubic millimeter. Blood cultures remained negative, and the patient became afebrile. He was\\ndischarged on the fourth hospital day, taking fos-\\ncarnet, cefuroxime axetil, epoetin (erythropoietin),\\nganciclovir, G-CSF, amitriptyline, megestrol acetate,\\nclotrimazole troches, and aerosolized pentamidine\\nmonthly.\\nTwo weeks before admission a cough developed,\\nwith scanty sputum; microscopical examination of a\\nstained smear of sputum showed no neutrophils, but a\\nculture yielded moderate Enterobacter cloacae; ciproflox-\\nacin was prescribed. Four days before entry the pa-\\ntient was worse, with a persistent cough, increasing\\ndyspnea, confusion, and intermittent low-grade fever\\nwith occasional sweats. He returned to the hospital.\\nThe temperature was 37.9°C, the pulse was 138,\\nand the respirations were 34. The blood pressure was\\n130/70 mm Hg.\\nOn physical examination the patient was thin and\\ndyspneic and appeared severely ill. Lesions of mollus-\\ncum contagiosum were present on the face, and Kapo-\\nsi\\'s sarcoma was observed on the palate and posterior\\nthorax. No lymphadenopathy was found. The neck\\nwas supple; the jugular venous pressure was less than\\n5 cm of water; there were diminished breath sounds\\nbilaterally, with inspiratory crackles throughout; no\\nwheeze or pleural friction rub was heard. No murmur,\\nS4, S3, or pericardial friction rub was detected. The\\nabdomen was slightly distended, soft, and nontender,\\nwith normal bowel sounds; the liver and spleen were\\nnot felt. There was trace peripheral edema bilaterally,\\nwithout digital clubbing. The genitalia were normal,\\nand rectal examination was negative; a stool specimen\\nwas positive (+ test) for occult blood. On neurologic\\nexamination the patient was confused; no hallucina-\\ntions or focal defects were found; evidence of peripher-\\nal neuropathy persisted.\\nThe urine was positive (++ test) for protein and\\ntrace positive for glucose; the sediment contained 10\\nred cells, 5 white cells, and 5 to 10 granular casts per\\nhigh-power field. The hematologic and blood chemi-\\ncal values throughout the hospital course are presented in Tables 2 and 3. An electrocardiogram showed\\na normal rhythm at a rate of 99, with nonspecific\\nST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Radiographs\\nof the chest revealed diffuse, extensive heterogeneous\\nair-space opacities, without septal lines or pleural effu-\\nsions; the heart size was normal. A cranial computed\\ntomographic (CT) scan, obtained without the intrave-\\nnous injection of contrast material, disclosed mild-to-\\nmoderate cerebral atrophy, without a mass effect,\\nmidline shift, or intracranial hemorrhage; there was\\ncomplete opacification of the sphenoid sinuses and\\nadjacent middle and posterior left ethmoid air cells,\\nand mucosal thickening was present in both maxillary\\nsinuses. A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the\\npatient was breathing an enriched oxygen mixture,\\nshowed that the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) was\\n52 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide\\n(PaCO2) 37 mm Hg, and the pH 7.25; examination of\\na specimen drawn while 100 percent oxygen was being\\nadministered by face mask disclosed that the PaO2\\nwas 210 mm Hg, the PaCO2 40 mm Hg, and the pH\\n7.26. Microscopical examination of a stained sputum\\nspecimen showed moderate neutrophils and mixed\\ngram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods.\\nThe trachea was intubated, and assisted ventilation\\nwas begun. Specimens of blood and sputum were ob-\\ntained for culture. An urgent examination with a fiber-\\noptic bronchoscope revealed mild mucosal inflamma-\\ntion; no purulent secretions or lesions of Kaposi\\'s\\nsarcoma were seen. Pentamidine, ganciclovir, foscar-\\nnet, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin were administered\\nby vein. Hypotension developed, and infusions of nor-\\nepinephrine and dopamine were begun; three units of\\npacked red cells were transfused. A nasogastric tube\\nwas inserted, and prednisone (80 mg daily) and tube\\nfeedings were begun. Epoetin and G-CSF were continued. The temperature was normal on most occasions\\nthereafter. Repeated x-ray films of the chest were un-\\nchanged. On the second hospital day the patient was\\nslightly more alert and responsive. Bronchoalveolar\\nwashings contained P. carinii microorganisms. On the\\nfollowing day a test of the urine for Legionella pneumoph-\\nila antigens was negative. Bacterial cultures of sputum\\nyielded no pathogenic microorganisms, and imipenem\\nwas discontinued.\\nOn the fourth hospital day the patient no longer\\nrequired pressor medications, but his condition was\\nunchanged otherwise. The temperature rose as high\\nas 37.7°C. Another electrocardiogram demonstrated\\nmore prominent inversion of T waves in leads Vi\\nthrough V3. Radiographs of the chest (Fig. 2) showed\\nno change in the air-space densities except for ques-\\ntionable superimposed, rounded opacities with central\\nradiolucencies; the mediastinum and heart remained\\nnormal. On the fifth hospital day the PaO2 fell from\\n74 mm Hg to the vicinity of 52 mm Hg; repeat-\\ned radiographs of the chest remained unchanged.\\nA test for cytomegalovirus antigen in a specimen\\nfrom bronchoalveolar lavage was negative. Hypoten-\\nsion recurred, and bradycardia developed. Comfort\\nmeasures were instituted, and later in the day the pa-\\ntient died.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. JOHN L. BRUSCH*: May we review the radio-\\ngraphic findings at the outset?\\nDR. MEENAKSHI BHALLA: A radiograph of the chest obtained 22 months before admission is normal. An-\\nother radiograph of the chest obtained eight months\\nbefore admission (Fig. 1) shows coarse reticular opac-\\nities and ground-glass opacities in the mid-lung zones,\\nwith atelectasis of the right middle lobe and slight\\ntenting of the right hemidiaphragm. A radiograph ob-\\ntained on admission demonstrates heterogeneous air-\\nspace opacities in both lungs, predominantly in the\\nmid-lung zones; the heart appears normal. A radio-\\ngraph of the chest obtained four days later (Fig. 2)\\nshows no important change in the air-space opacities,\\nbut there is a suggestion of lucent areas within some of\\nthe denser areas.\\nDR. BRUSCH: In the classic clinicopathological con-\\nference a single disease is brilliantly and meticulously\\nexcavated from the myriad facts and red herrings of\\nthe case record. In a discussion involving a patient\\nwith AIDS, however, the search for a single diagnosis\\nmay be fruitless, since multiple pathologic processes\\noccur simultaneously in this disease.\\nI shall begin by outlining several characteristics of\\nAIDS that should be kept in mind during consider-\\nation of this case. The first is the long-term nature of\\nHIV infections. Although the case history goes back\\n32 months, the patient may have contracted the infec-\\ntion 10 years or more before he was tested for the\\nvirus. During this occult phase of the infection pro-\\nfound changes had occurred in his immune system.\\nSecond, the natural history of AIDS is being altered\\nby state-of-the-art therapy, aimed against both the\\nretrovirus and associated infections and neoplasms. 2,3\\nAs patients\\' survival is prolonged because of im-\\nproved therapy, the types of disease will be constantly\\nchanging as more profound deficiencies of their im-\\nmune systems develop. An example is that fewer\\npatients are dying of P. carinii pneumonia as a result\\nof prophylaxis, and fatal bacterial infections are be-\\ncoming more common. Third, we must remember\\nthat \"prophylaxis\" against various pathogens is in\\nmany ways not truly prophylaxis but is in reality sup-\\npressive therapy. It is intended to prevent clinical\\nmanifestations of the disease, but it cannot be expect-\\ned to eradicate the organism from the patient because\\nof impaired host defenses. 6,7 P. carinii is still seen\\nin 50 percent of samples of bronchoalveolar-lavage\\nfluid after a successful clinical response to therapy.\\nFourth, the attending clinician should keep in mind\\nall the previous illnesses that the patient has had,\\nno matter how remote, since these patients\\' patho-\\ngens can persist for the rest of their lives. Fifth,\\ntherapy against one organism can have effects on oth-\\ner pathogens. For example, bacterial pneumonia in\\npatients with HIV disease may be underdiagnosed\\nbecause of the widespread use of trimethoprim-\\nsulfamethoxazole. Sixth, long-term use of suppres-\\nsive therapy, such as zidovudine or ganciclovir, may\\nresult in the development of resistance to these im-\\nportant antiviral agents.8.9 Such resistance needs to\\nbe considered in a patient whose clinical status is de-\\nteriorating and in whom no other cause can be found.\\nIn addition, interruption of antiviral therapy may markedly blunt its effect. Seventh, a clinically evi-\\ndent infection may be due to several pathogenic proc-\\nesses, 10 and it is often difficult to ascertain which is\\nthe prime mover. Eighth, the findings of physical\\nexamination, radiographic studies, and clinical labo-\\nratory tests may be difficult to interpret because of\\nthe abnormalities in the host\\'s response that may\\ncause infectious diseases to mimic noninfectious dis-\\nease, and vice versa. 11,12 Ninth, even clinical histories\\nmay be unreliable in patients with AIDS, since fever\\nand fatigue are usually of such long standing that\\nthe patients are unable to describe changes in their\\ncourse.\\nThe AIDS-defining illness for this patient was cyto-\\nmegalovirus pneumonia, with the diagnosis made by\\ntransbronchial biopsy. At that time he clearly was in\\nan advanced stage of the disease (Walter Reed stage\\n6). This virus has two important characteristics that\\nhave made it a major pathogen in patients with AIDS.\\nThe first is its ability to interfere with the lymphocytic\\nresponse to various organisms, such as P. carinii and\\ntoxoplasma. It acts synergistically with other infec-\\ntious agents to accelerate the damage to the host. The\\nsecond characteristic is its ability to persist in a latent\\nform in cells of many types. However, the frequen-\\ncy of cytomegalovirus pneumonia in patients with\\nAIDS is controversial. In the lung, cytomegalovirus\\nappears to be a fellow traveler and has little direct\\nrole in pulmonary infections, as opposed to its major\\neffects in other organs. Why that is true remains\\nunclear. 13 Therapy with ganciclovir and immune glob-\\nulin has met the greatest success in treating the\\ncytomegalovirus pneumonia of patients with bone\\nmarrow involvement. The survival rate ranges from\\n52 to 85 percent. 14-16 Little time elapsed before the\\npatient\\'s next major encounter with cytomegalovi-\\nrus, in the form of retinitis. Eventually, both ganci-\\nclovir and foscarnet were given together. Foscarnet\\nappears to have a survival advantage over ganciclovir\\nin patients being treated for cytomegalovirus retini-\\ntis. 17,18 We can speculate that ongoing cytomegalovi-\\nrus infection only hastened the deterioration of his\\nimmune system.\\nThe development of amebic dysentery 13 months\\ninto the course of this patient\\'s disease strongly sug-\\ngests that he was still placing himself in harm\\'s way\\nby continuing to engage in high-risk behavior. The\\nlong-term consequences of repeated antigenic stimu-\\nlation are speculative but intriguing.\\nIt is not surprising that this patient\\'s next major\\nillness was P. carinii pneumonia. His CD4+ count con-\\ntinued to plummet (to less than 50 per cubic millime-\\nter). When the CD4+ count is below 200, a patient is\\nat high risk for infections due to certain organisms,\\nespecially P. carinii and intracellular pathogens. 19 Al-\\nthough dapsone has a prophylactic effect superior to\\nthat of aerosolized pentamidine, its effect does not\\nmatch that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. 20 Sec-\\nond-line treatment failed, and pentamidine and fos-\\ncarnet, both given intravenously, were required. Each of these drugs can cause hypocalcemia; if they are\\nused together, the risk is increased. 21\\nWe are not told exactly how long zidovudine ther-\\napy was given to this patient. It was stopped and\\nrestarted many times because of leukopenia. Oth-\\ner types of antiretroviral therapy were not used be-\\ncause of clinical problems such as peripheral neurop-\\nathy. He probably received little effective anti-HIV\\ntherapy.\\nFive months later another bout of pneumonia oc-\\ncurred, presumably bacterial pneumonia in view of its\\noccurrence in the setting of leukopenia and its prompt\\nresponse to antibacterial therapy alone. At that time\\na decision was made to rely on aerosolized pentami-\\ndine as a means of prophylaxis against P. carinii pneu-\\nmonia.\\nThe final stage of the patient\\'s illness began insid-\\niously with various respiratory tract symptoms that\\nprogressed over two weeks despite the empirical use\\nof ciprofloxacin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The\\nmajor findings of the initial evaluation included het-\\nerogeneous alveolar opacities shown on x-ray films\\nof the chest without effusion, a heavy concentration of\\nP. carinii organisms found on bronchoalveolar lavage,\\nwidespread sinusitis, a markedly elevated serum lac-\\ntate dehydrogenase level, and hypoxemia with relative\\nhypercapnia. Eventually, T-wave inversions became\\nmore distinct, along with the suggestion of cavitations\\non x-ray films of the chest. Gram\\'s staining of the\\nsputum showed a mixed flora, but cultures remained\\nnegative.\\nWhen the HIV infection is not advanced, pulmo-\\nnary infections are caused by a nonopportunistic or-\\nganism, such as a pyogenic bacterium or Mycobacterium\\ntuberculosis. The fairly acute onset of this patient\\'s in-\\nfection, with fever and a productive cough, is much\\nmore consistent with bacterial pneumonia than with\\nP. carinii infection. There is generally no substantial\\ndifference in the clinical picture of bacterial pneumo-\\nnia between patients who are HIV-positive and those\\nwho are HIV-negative. Even an acute presentation of\\nP. carinii pneumonia differs from that of a pyogenic\\npneumonia. However, the history may not help in the\\ndifferentiation of bacterial from nonbacterial pulmo-\\nnary infections in HIV-positive patients, since the dis-\\ntinctions may be blurred by the early use of empirical\\nantibiotic therapy and, because of simultaneous pul-\\nmonary infections with both categories of pathogens,\\nbacterial pneumonias are becoming more common\\nand currently affect 10 to 20 percent of HIV-positive\\npatients. 22,23 Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus in-fluenzae are the most common isolates. Bacterial pneu-\\nmonia often occurs in patients who are HIV-positive\\nbut in whom AIDS has not yet developed. Many of\\nthe patients are afebrile, with bacteremia (50 to 75\\npercent of the cases) and with a high rate of recur-\\nrence within six months. A variation of pyogenic\\npneumonia produced by H. influenzae24 is character-\\nized by interstitial infiltrates, a nonproductive cough,\\na subacute course, and multilobar disease. M. tubercu-\\nlosis infection usually develops insidiously, with fever\\nand marked debilitation.\\nWhen Kaposi\\'s sarcoma involves the lung, it usual-\\nly has a fairly rapid and progressive course. The\\ncourse may be prolonged, however, and therefore the\\ndisorder may be confused with various infections. 25\\nGram-negative aerobes, such as klebsiella species, are\\nusually nosocomial in origin and not community-\\nacquired. It is unusual for patients with AIDS, in con-\\ntrast to other immunosuppressed patients, to have\\nfungal pulmonary infections.\\nP. carinii pneumonia 26 commonly presents with fever\\nand a cough, which is usually nonproductive but may\\nproduce sputum in patients with chronic lung dis-\\nease or those with concurrent bacterial infection (10\\nto 30 percent of the cases). The hallmark symptom\\nof dyspnea progresses from being exertional to oc-\\ncurring even at rest. In this case prednisone was\\nstarted, presumably because of severe hypoxia due\\nto P. carinii pneumonia.\\nAll these pulmonary processes can result in a wide\\nrange of abnormalities shown on x-ray films of the chest, but certain patterns are helpful diagnostically.\\nOften changes induced by therapy or by repeated in-\\nfection have an effect on the specificity of the radiolog-\\nic patterns. The presence of cavities suggests infection\\ndue to M. tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, aspergillus\\nspecies, and nocardia.27 In addition, Rhodococcus equi,\\na coccobacillus that lives in the soil and resembles\\ndiphtheroids, can cause cavitation, especially of the\\nupper lobes, in immunosuppressed patients. The in-\\nfection is usually subacute and produces granulo-\\nmas. 28 Diffuse interstitial alveolar infiltrates are seen\\nmost commonly in P. carinii pneumonia but are also\\nseen in Kaposi\\'s sarcoma and cytomegalovirus pneu-\\nmonia. 29 Currently, over 40 percent of patients with\\nP. carinii pneumonia have atypical patterns, especially\\npatterns including infiltrates that are seen principally\\nin the upper lobes; most of these patients have been\\ngiven aerosolized pentamidine for prophylaxis. The\\ncause of this pattern is not completely understood, but\\nit is associated with unequal distribution of the drug\\nwhen it is given by nebulizer. This effect is pro-\\nnounced in patients with previous lung disease, espe-\\ncially of the obstructive type, like the patient under\\ndiscussion. Other important consequences of treat-\\nment with aerosolized pentamidine are disseminated\\nP. carinii pneumonia30 and pneumothorax, which is\\ndue to localized necrosis of lung tissue caused by the\\nheavy growth of P. carinii. It has a grave progno-\\nsis. Intrathoracic lymphadenopathy is a hallmark of\\ninfection due to M. tuberculosis or M. avium complex\\nand of Kaposi\\'s sarcoma. Prominent lymphadenopa-\\nthy is not characteristic of P. carinii pneumonia or of\\nthe bacterial pneumonias. Pleural effusion is common-\\nly seen with tuberculosis, Kaposi\\'s sarcoma, fungal\\ninfections, and congestive heart failure. Congestive\\nheart failure, by itself or with other pulmonary patho-\\nlogic processes, may produce many of the changes\\nseen on this patient\\'s radiographs of the chest. Car-\\ndiac disease may have been a silent partner in this\\ncase of AIDS and in many others, as I shall dis-\\ncuss later.\\nClinical laboratory tests are generally of little use\\nin evaluating pulmonary infections in patients with\\nAIDS. The white-cell count is typically elevated when\\nbacterial infections are present, unless the patient is\\ntaking drugs that suppress the bone marrow. Clearly,\\nexamination of sputum by Gram\\'s staining and cul-\\nture is important. As in this patient, however, the\\nwidespread use of antibiotics on an outpatient basis\\nmay lessen the yield of both Gram\\'s staining and cul-\\nture. In this patient these studies did not exclude any\\nof the potential pathogens, including R. equi. The\\npatient\\'s white-cell count was most consistent with\\na bacterial pneumonia or with infiltrative disease of\\nthe bone marrow. The finding of a large amount of\\nP. carinii indicates the inadequacy of aerosolized pen-\\ntamidine in this patient. Usually, prophylaxis lowers\\nthe number of organisms to levels that are barely de-\\ntectable in induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage,\\nand transbronchial biopsy is often needed to make the diagnosis. Prednisone therapy was begun in this case\\npresumably because of the marked hypoxia due to the\\nP. carinii pneumonia. This drug is a double-edged\\nsword when mixed infections are present, because it\\nsuppresses the inflammatory response of the host\\nand masks the symptoms of infection. The serum lac-\\ntate dehydrogenase level is elevated or rising in\\n95 percent of patients with P. carinii pneumonia. 31\\nThe serum lactate dehydrogenase level is high in\\nabout 20 percent of patients with other types of infec-\\ntion. However, the value in this patient was most con-\\nsistent with active P. carinii pneumonia. We are not\\ngiven the results of blood cultures or acid-fast smears\\nof sputum.\\nThe absence of endobronchial lesions of Kaposi\\'s\\nsarcoma on bronchoscopic examination does not ex-\\nclude parenchymal involvement. However, the patient\\nhad no other hallmarks of this disease on the radio-\\ngraphs of the chest or evidence of generalized lym-\\nphadenopathy on physical examination. In short,\\nthere is no indication that this disease had spread be-\\nyond the skin.\\nA major question is whether the patient\\'s decreased\\nlevel of consciousness was due to his debility and ter-\\nminal state or to a more specific neurologic abnormal-\\nity. Inflammation of multiple sinuses is common in\\npatients with AIDS. Sinusitis is most often bacterial in\\norigin and is usually caused by the same species that\\nare found in the lungs.32 Fungal sinusitis is much less\\nfrequent than in other immunosuppressed patients.\\nThere have been case reports of rhinocerebral zygo-\\nmycosis in patients with AIDS. 33 We do not have any\\nclinical information to assess the importance of the\\nsinusitis in this patient. One could speculate that he\\nhad a complication of sinusitis, especially of the sphe-\\nnoid sinus, 34 such as a brain abscess, cavernous-sinus\\nthrombosis, or meningitis, which can arise from this\\nsite. The most likely complication in this patient with-\\nout any focal signs would be meningitis, which may be\\nmanifested by few classic signs and symptoms in an\\nimmunosuppressed patient. It would be interesting to\\nhave the results of a CT scan obtained with contrast\\nmaterial.\\nI shall discuss briefly the cryptic causes of morbid-\\nity and mortality in patients with AIDS. The first is\\ncardiac involvement. 35,36 The disorders that may affect\\nthe heart range from direct retroviral infection of the\\nmyocardium to herpetic myocarditis, to marantic\\nendocarditis, to involvement by Kaposi\\'s sarcoma.\\nThese processes are usually silent but may result in\\nmanifestations of myocarditis, acute myocardial in-\\nfarction, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Echocardio-\\ngrams are abnormal in about 20 percent of cases of\\nAIDS, with pericardial effusions and dilated cardio-\\nmyopathy the most common findings. When cardiac\\ndysfunction occurs, the clinical picture may be as-\\ncribed to noncardiac causes that mimic heart disease,\\nsuch as respiratory failure. This patient apparently\\ndid not have an echocardiographic study. The only clue to possible cardiac disease in this case is the de-\\nvelopment of T-wave inversions, but it may have been\\nrelated to hypoxia or fever instead.\\nThe second area of silent disease in patients with\\nAIDS is disseminated P. carinii infection, 37,38 which\\noccurs in 1.25 to 2.5 percent of the patients. The or-\\nganism travels by the lymphatic or hematogenous\\nroute and most commonly involves the lymph nodes,\\nspleen, and bone marrow. The heart is affected in\\nabout 15 percent of the cases. When P. carinii infection\\ninvolves the skin, it may closely resemble Kaposi\\'s\\nsarcoma. Cardiac involvement often takes the form of\\nmyocarditis. The findings in this patient\\'s peripheral\\nsmear may have reflected bone marrow involvement\\nwith P. carinii infection. If the organism invades\\nthe adrenal glands, it may produce a relative adrenal\\ninsufficiency. Disseminated P. carinii infection is most\\ncommonly seen in patients who are receiving aerosol-\\nized pentamidine (55 percent of the cases). Pneumo-\\nnia is not always clinically evident at the time of\\ndissemination, but the mortality appears to be greater\\nwhen there is multilobar involvement. When cyto-\\nmegalovirus infection is present concurrently, the\\nmortality reaches 75 percent. Treatment with sys-\\ntemic agents decreases the death rate to about 55\\npercent. It is important not to discount the possi-\\nbility of severe, disseminated infection with P. cari-\\nnii because the patient was receiving prophylaxis\\nagainst this pathogen. Dissemination usually occurs\\n15 months after the institution of aerosolized prophy-\\nlaxis (range, 4 to 24 months). Ultrasound examination\\ncan show echogenic foci of infection, and the involved\\norgans may show evidence of necrosis and calcifi-\\ncation.\\nWhat was the cause of this patient\\'s death? The\\nidentification of an organism does not mean that it\\nhad an important role in a given stage of the disease.\\nEvidence of M. avium complex may have been found in\\nhis bloodstream and organs, but its importance in\\npatients with AIDS is doubtful. I believe that the pul-\\nmonary disease was a combination of P. carinii pneu-\\nmonia and bacterial pneumonia, probably caused by\\nS. aureus. Because of the heavy load of P. carinii organ-\\nisms and the treatment with aerosolized pentamidine,\\nthe patient probably had disseminated P. carinii infec-\\ntion, but how much it contributed to his deterioration\\nis not clear. He probably also had cytomegalovirus\\nviremia, which may well have become resistant to gan-\\nciclovir and contributed to his rapid decline. I doubt\\nthe importance of sinusitis in this case, although its\\npotential for causing severe central nervous system\\ndisease cannot be ignored. Certainly, most of the clini-\\ncal picture could have been caused by a noninfectious\\ndisorder such as Kaposi\\'s sarcoma, but there is no\\nevidence for its existence except in the mucocutaneous\\nareas. There is no evidence to support a diagnosis of\\nmycobacterial or fungal disease. The proximate cause\\nof death could have been a pneumothorax resulting\\nfrom necrosis of lung tissue due to P. carinii pneumo-nia or aspiration pneumonia resulting from the naso-\\ngastric-tube feedings.\\nMy diagnoses are pneumonia caused by P. carinii\\nand bacteria, disseminated P. carinii infection, bacteri-\\nal sinusitis, and myocarditis due to an opportunistic\\ninfection.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\nPneumocystis carinii pneumonia.\\nKaposi\\'s sarcoma, with mucocutaneous and pulmo-\\nnary involvement.\\n\\nDR.

EUGENE J. MARK: At autopsy the lungs together\\nweighed 1940 g, approximately three times normal. Dark-red, solid tissue occupied two thirds of the pa-\\nrenchyma and was revealed to be Kaposi\\'s sarcoma on\\nmicroscopical examination. Spindle-cell tumor con-\\ntaining intercellular erythrocytes encircled broncho-\\nvascular bundles39 in some areas (Fig. 3) and solidi-\\nfied the lung elsewhere. Some of the increased weight\\nwas due to pooling of blood in telangiectatic areas\\nof the sarcoma. During the final days of this patient\\'s\\nlife the tumor behaved like a malignant pneumonia,\\neven though the radiographically demonstrable con-\\nsolidation is more typical of pneumocystis infection\\nthan of Kaposi\\'s sarcoma. 40 A patient with AIDS\\ndescribed in another case record¹¹ had Kaposi\\'s sar-\\ncoma that progressed from an interstitial infiltrate\\nto air-space consolidation during the last few weeks\\nof life. The tumor in the case under discussion invaded arteries and partially occluded them, and throm-\\nboemboli that probably arose in leg veins were also\\npresent. There was infarction of both tumorous\\nand nontumorous lung, but cavitation had not oc-\\ncurred. The sarcoma had metastasized to hilar lymph\\nnodes.\\nP. carinii pneumonia was detected in regions of non-\\ntumorous lung. In some alveoli the organisms were so\\nabundant that they appeared as lakes of smudged sil-\\nver-positive spherules (Fig. 4). Clumps of overlapping\\norganisms have been illustrated previously in pneu-\\nmocystis pneumonia that persisted after treatment.42\\nCrescentic forms could be seen where the organisms\\nlay individually (Fig. 5). The organisms were pleo-\\nmorphic, and some of them were swollen. These\\nchanges are probably the effect of prolonged but only\\npartially effective treatment.43 The organisms could\\nalso be found in exudate within the Kaposi\\'s sarcoma\\n(Fig. 6).\\nStaining for S-100 antigen revealed a few Langer-\\nhans\\' cells in the interstitium; the walls of some spher-\\nules of pneumocystis were also stained for this anti-\\ngen. Antibodies to pneumocystis can be found in\\nserum and bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid, 44 and mono-\\nclonal antibodies have been developed to stain the organism. 45,46 I am not aware, however, of reports of\\nstaining with S-100.\\nHyaline membranes indicative of diffuse alveolar\\ndamage were present. Diffuse alveolar damage at au-\\ntopsy is due most commonly to the administration of\\noxygen but has also been associated with Kaposi\\'s\\nsarcoma39 and pneumocystis infection.47 No bacteria,\\nmycobacteria, fungi, or viral inclusions were present\\nin the lungs. Immunopathological studies for herpes-\\nvirus and cytomegalovirus were negative.\\nKaposi\\'s sarcoma was present in sections of the\\nskin. Examination of the brain showed HIV encepha-\\nlopathy, with perivascular lymphocytes and macro-\\nphages in the cerebral cortex and focal demyelination\\nwith mononuclear-cell infiltration and reactive astro-\\ncytosis in the white matter of the cerebral hemi-\\nspheres. The heart was normal, without myocarditis\\nor vegetations.',\n",
       " 'A 28-year-old man was evaluated at the hospital because of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), pancytopenia, and lymphoma.\\nThe patient had been well until 38 months earlier, when he was first examined at this hospital because of generalized lymphadenopathy, and a test for antibod- ies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was posi- tive. He was raised in Ohio and had traveled through- out the United States. He was a phlebotomist at another medical facility, where he wore rubber gloves when working; he had received two transfusions after a motor vehicle accident nine years earlier and had no other risk factors except for a heterosexual relation- ship in which protection was used. The hematocrit was 40.6 percent; the white-cell count was 3800, with a normal differential count. The CD4+ cell count was 206, and the CD8+ cell count 13,016 per cubic mil- limeter. A test for antibodies to toxoplasma, a sero- logic test for syphilis, and a tuberculin skin test (PPD, 5 TU) were negative. Zidovudine and aerosolized pentamidine were begun. During the ensuing 15 months the hematocrit ranged from 33 to 38.1 percent, the white-cell count from 1900 to 5400, and the plate- let count from 115,000 to 222,000. The patient experi- enced several episodes of oral ulcers, with positive cultures for herpes simplex virus; the ulcers responded well to treatment with acyclovir.\\nTwenty-three months before entry the hematocrit was 22.2 percent, the white-cell count 2100, and the platelet count 143,000; the mean corpuscular vol- ume was 109 µm³. Zidovudine was withheld for sev- eral weeks and was resumed in a lower dose after the hematocrit rose to 30 percent, with a white-cell count of 2000. Three months later the dose of zido- vudine was increased. Five weeks thereafter the hem- atocrit was 23.5 percent, the white-cell count 2100, and the platelet count 166,000; zidovudine was dis- continued, and didanosine was substituted.\\nEleven months before admission the white-cell count fell to the range of 1300 to 1500; the hematocrit was 32.4 to 35.2 percent, and the platelet count 66,000 to 104,000. The dose of didanosine was reduced, and the white-cell count gradually rose to 2900 during the next two months.\\nNine months before admission Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia developed. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxa- zole was begun, but the white-cell count fell to 1800. Dapsone and trimethoprim were started but provoked a severe tremor, and clindamycin and primaquine were substituted, with resolution of the pneumonia. One month later an acute febrile illness resolved with- out treatment. A blood culture for Mycobacterium avi- um complex and a test for cryptococcal antigen were negative.\\nSeven months before entry the CD4+ cell count was 13 per cubic millimeter. Microscopical examination of a cutaneous lesion on the thigh confirmed a clinical diagnosis of Kaposi\\'s sarcoma. Several weeks later the hematocrit was 25.9 percent, the white-cell count 1500, and the platelet count 76,000; didanosine was discontinued.\\nSix months before admission one dose of trimeth- oprim-sulfamethoxazole, given as prophylaxis for P. carinii pneumonia, was followed by the development of pruritus and erythroderma. Dapsone was substitut- ed, and zidovudine was resumed. Eighteen days later the hematocrit had fallen from 30 to 25.4 percent; the white-cell count was 1100, and the platelet count 71,000; zidovudine was discontinued. Thereafter anti- retroviral medication was discontinued.\\nFive months before admission the patient was ex- amined in the hematology-oncology clinic, where he reported anorexia, weight loss, and a temperature as high as 37.8°C, without other symptoms. The blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg. A solitary lesion of Ka- posi\\'s sarcoma was present on the left thigh; no pete- chiae or ecchymoses were observed, and no lymphade- nopathy was found. The liver and spleen were not felt. The laboratory values are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Microscopical examination of a biopsy specimen of the bone marrow revealed a normocellular marrow, with normal erythroid and myeloid maturation and a very slight decrease in the myeloid:erythroid ratio; megakaryocytes were normal, and iron stores were adequate; no evidence of Kaposi\\'s sarcoma or lym- phoma was detected; examination of special stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungi and cultures, including fungal cultures, were negative. Epoetin (erythropoie- tin), filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating fac- tor), and iron were begun, and during the next six weeks the white-cell count rose to 2300; the hematocrit declined to 14.5 percent, and the platelet count was 71,000. Three units of packed red cells were trans- fused. Twelve weeks before entry the patient came to the emergency ward because of five days of fever and lightheadedness, with exertional dyspnea. The labora- tory values are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Three units of packed red cells were transfused, with consid- erable improvement. Two specimens were drawn for blood culture, and one flask of each yielded campylo- bacter species; ciprofloxacin was given.\\nTen weeks before admission, while the patient was receiving clindamycin, primaquine, ciprofloxacin, and acyclovir, he entered the hospital because of fatigue, confusion, diarrhea, and \"greening\" of his skin. On physical examination he was afebrile, and the blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg. No retinopathy or oral lesions were found. The neck was supple, and the lungs were clear; the heart and abdomen were normal. The laboratory values are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Radiographs of the chest were normal. All medica- tions were withheld for one day, with marked sympto- matic improvement except that a low-grade fever promptly returned. Pentamidine was given by vein, and the patient was discharged on the third hospital day, to continue taking epoetin, filgrastim, pentami- dine, and erythromycin. Hyposensitization to trimeth- oprim-sulfamethoxazole was undertaken. Eighteen days later, while the patient was receiving acyclovir, epoetin, filgrastim, and pentoxifylline, he returned to the clinic three days after he had received four units of packed red cells because the hematocrit had dropped to 19.2 percent. Physical examination showed no lym- phadenopathy, clear lungs, and no hepatosplenomeg- aly. The hematocrit was 30.6 percent, the white-cell count 2100, and the platelet count 105,000; the mean corpuscular volume was 84 µm³. The dose of epoetin was increased from 4000 units every other day to 4000 units six days a week, and filgrastim was discontinued.\\nOne month before entry the patient returned to the clinic and reported that he was feeling well except for a sore throat. On examination he was afebrile, and no abnormality was found. The hematocrit was 22 per- cent, the white-cell count 1500, the platelet count 91,000, and the reticulocyte count less than 0.1 per- cent; the mean corpuscular volume was 83 µm³. The dose of epoetin was increased to 10,000 units six days a week, and one week later three units of packed red cells were transfused.\\nSixteen days before entry the patient again visited the clinic and reported that his sore throat improved during trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment. On examination he was afebrile; no lymphadenopathy was found; the lungs, heart, and abdomen remained normal. The hematologic findings are presented in Table 1. Epoetin was discontinued. A few days later a small bulge was observed to the left of the uvula. Mi- croscopical examination of a biopsy specimen of the swollen area disclosed malignant lymphoma, diffuse large-cell type; examination of special stains for acid- fast bacilli, fungi, and spirochetes was negative.\\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital, where a diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. HOWARD M. HELLER*: This 28-year-old man with HIV infection had a CD4 lymphocyte count of 206 cells per cubic millimeter when his HIV infection was diagnosed three years before the recent admis- sion, but the count declined to 13 cells per cubic milli- meter seven months before admission. He had pancy- topenia for several months, with an anemia that was more pronounced than the depression of the leukocyte and platelet counts. He recovered from P. carinii pneu- monia and had cutaneous Kaposi\\'s sarcoma. Over the preceding few months severe refractory transfusion- dependent anemia developed, without reticulocytosis despite supplementation with recombinant human erythropoietin. He was then found to have diffuse large-cell lymphoma in the pharynx, without evidence of lymphoma elsewhere on physical examination.\\nThe patient\\'s primary problem before the discovery of the lymphoma was the severe refractory anemia, and I shall focus my discussion on this aspect of his disease. Anemia of various degrees of severity occurs in up to 70 percent of patients with HIV infection and in up to 90 percent of patients with AIDS. In pa- tients with HIV infection anemia may have many causes, which often coexist. This case illustrates sev- eral of them.\\nAfter the patient started to take zidovudine, mild anemia developed and remained stable over a 15- month period. Although severe anemia may follow zi- dovudine therapy, most patients with asymptomatic HIV infection have only a mild-to-moderate macro- cytic anemia, which stabilizes. At times, however, after remaining stable for many months, the anemia worsens suddenly, as it did in this patient. After zido- vudine was discontinued, the hematocrit gradually rose again, as would be expected if the anemia was due to the zidovudine. The hematocrit, however, did not return completely to the base-line value of 41 per- cent, suggesting that another factor was involved in the anemia. Didanosine, which is not commonly a cause of anemia, was his only other medication. Al- though there is not enough information to evaluate the anemia fully, it was probably due to the HIV infection itself, which can cause anemia by direct viral infection of bone marrow progenitor cells or by circulating se- rum factors that inhibit maturation of these cells. 1-5\\nFive months before the recent admission severe ane- mia recurred, and many blood transfusions were re- quired over the next few months. The cause of the anemia at that time may have been multifactorial. I shall assume that the patient did not simply have evi- dence of occult gastrointestinal blood loss. A descrip- tion of his blood smear would reveal whether there was evidence of peripheral destruction of erythro- cytes. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is im- probable, since his platelet count of 117,000 was not substantially changed from the base-line value and his coagulation times were not prolonged. He was eventu- ally found to have methemoglobinemia of 11.1 per- cent, which may have been partly responsible for the anemia. It is not clear when the dapsone was discon- tinued, but both dapsone, which has a long half-life of up to 44 hours, and primaquine can cause methemo- globinemia leading to severe anemia.\\nWhen the methemoglobinemia was discovered, the reticulocyte count was only 0.1 percent. Despite the severe anemia the bone marrow was not respond- ing normally by producing more erythrocytes. What caused the failure of the marrow to respond appropri- ately? HIV infection itself can suppress the bone mar- row directly and prevent reticulocytosis, but that diag- nosis is one of exclusion. HIV infection can result in failure to produce red cells indirectly, by causing the production of erythropoietin to decrease, and this pa- tient\\'s endogenous level was very low. In most pa- tients there is at least a partial response to the admin- istration of recombinant human erythropoietin, but in this patient there was no response despite prolonged treatment with very high doses. 6,7 The lack of erythro- cyte production was not due to folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, since the serum levels were normal. He was not iron-deficient, since his serum iron level was normal and his marrow stores were adequate when he first needed transfusions. His medications, acyclovir and pentoxifylline, do not suppress the bone marrow. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which was given for P. carinii pneumonia prophylaxis, can cause bone mar- row suppression, but at the low doses used for prophy- laxis substantial suppression is rare, and when it does occur the erythrocytes are not preferentially affected.\\nIn evaluating anemia without reticulocytosis, espe- cially in the setting of pancytopenia, one must consid- er infiltrative disease of the marrow. In this patient with newly diagnosed large-cell lymphoma, the obvi- ous concern was lymphomatous infiltration of the marrow and replacement of the blood precursors. Considerable marrow replacement would have had to occur to result in such marked anemia and leukopenia. In view of the absence of peripheral lymphadenopa- thy, hepatosplenomegaly, or systemic B symptoms it is unlikely that the bone marrow was filled with lym- phoma. A hemophagocytic syndrome associated with lymphoma has been described, 8-10 but this syndrome is rare and is associated with marked lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, which were absent in this patient. Kaposi\\'s sarcoma can affect the bone marrow, but extensive visceral or bone marrow involvement in AIDS-related Kaposi\\'s sarcoma is usually seen in the setting of multifocal mucocutaneous disease. This pa- tient\\'s disease appeared to be restricted to the skin on his lower extremity.\\nMany of the AIDS-related opportunistic infections can be associated with bone marrow suppression. With some of these infections, such as those due to M. tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis, it occurs as a result of massive bone marrow infiltration in the setting of widely disseminated disease, and the patients typically have fever, chills, sweats, and often lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, none of which this patient had. Disseminated M. avium com- plex infection can cause pancytopenia as a result of massive bone marrow infiltration, but unlike other systemic infections this disorder is often associated with a profound anemia disproportionate to the de- gree of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Recent evidence suggests that the infected macrophages in this disease produce a soluble factor that has a di- rect suppressive effect on erythroid progenitor cells. 12 This patient did not have persistent fever or night sweats, which are usually seen in patients with dis- seminated M. avium complex infection. Of the disseminated viral opportunistic infections, cytomegalovirus infection is most commonly associat- ed with bone marrow suppression in patients with AIDS, but the pancytopenia that results usually does not include a disproportionately pronounced anemia. The bone marrow suppression can be seen even in the absence of end-organ disease, such as retinitis or coli- tis, but these patients would almost certainly have detectable viremia.\\nEpstein-Barr virus can also cause bone marrow suppression and red-cell aplasia, but substantial hem- atopoietic failure is uncommon. The suppression ap- pears to result from a T-cell lymphocyte-mediated immune response, probably related to an increase in suppressor T cells, which develop to curb the B-cell clonal expansion due to Epstein-Barr-virus infec- tion. 13 Epstein-Barr-virus infection has also been as- sociated with a hemophagocytic syndrome that results in pancytopenia, but patients with this syndrome gen- erally have a more abrupt onset of the disorder, are usually very ill, and always have marked lymphad- enopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, which were not present in this patient. Epstein-Barr-virus infection has also been associated with aplastic anemia, but the thrombocytopenia is usually as prominent as the anemia, if not more prominent. Rarely, Epstein- Barr-virus infection causes a pure red-cell aplasia, with a picture similar to that of the patient under discussion.\\nThe infectious agent most often associated with a pure red-cell aplasia is B19 parvovirus. The infection can cause a transient aplastic crisis in patients with underlying hemolysis, such as occurs during a sickle cell crisis or in autoimmune-mediated hemolytic ane- mia. If the infection is acquired during pregnancy, erythroblastosis fetalis may develop as a result of in- fection of fetal erythroid progenitor cells during their period of rapid maturation in utero. The disease is due to the virus\\' selective infection of the erythroid precur- sors in the marrow during periods of increased reticu- locyte demand. The direct infection of the erythroid progenitor cells leads to their lysis and results in ery- throid hypoplasia. B19 parvovirus has been reported as a cause of chronic erythroid hypoplasia due to per- sistent infection lasting as long as 10 years. 14-16 In re- cent years persistent parvovirus infection has also been reported as a cause of intractable anemia in pa- tients with HIV infection. 17-20 Cases of the hemophag- ocytic syndrome due to B19 parvovirus have also been reported, but in those cases the clinical features are the same as those in cases of Epstein-Barr-virus infec- tion and other virus-associated hemophagocytic syn- dromes that I described earlier. 21,22\\nThe ability to clear parvovirus infection and limit its effect on the erythroid cells depends on the mounting of an adequate antibody response. Patients with HIV infection, especially in the later stages of the disease, have humoral dysregulation and therefore often do not mount an appropriate antibody response to the infec- tion. Parvovirus infection is common, and up to 85 percent of adults have serologic evidence of previous infection. Surveys of patients with AIDS have shown a lower seroprevalence rate of only 64 percent, 23 prob- ably reflecting a lower likelihood of maintaining ade- quate humoral immunity rather than a reduced fre- quency of previous exposure. Further evidence of the importance of B19-specific antibodies are reports de- scribing the clearing of infection after the administra- tion of gamma globulin. Clearance of the infection is rapid once the patient mounts an antibody response or once the gamma globulin is administered.\\nAlthough this patient\\'s course was most consistent with persistent B19 parvovirus infection, I must make a unifying diagnosis. After having severe transfusion- dependent anemia for months he was found to have a diffuse large-cell lymphoma in the pharynx. Lympho- ma is a common complication of AIDS and appears to be occurring at increasing rates, perhaps partly be- cause of the increase in life expectancy of patients with AIDS over the past few years. The vast majority of AIDS-associated lymphomas are B-cell in origin, and they usually are of aggressive large-cell types. Several studies have demonstrated an association with Epstein-Barr-virus infection, and a causal relation is probable, at least in some cases. It is possible that this patient\\'s lymphoma and bone marrow disorder were related, not necessarily by lymphomatous infiltration of the marrow but possibly by Epstein-Barr-virus- induced B-cell lymphoma in the pharynx and else- where and by Epstein-Barr-virus-induced red-cell aplasia.\\nIn summary, the patient\\'s blood and bone marrow had been beset by many problems over the preceding three years, including HIV infection, therapy with zidovudine, dapsone, and primaquine, and inade- quate endogenous production of erythropoietin. I be- lieve that the latest assault was infection due to either Epstein-Barr virus or B19 parvovirus. The diagnostic procedure was probably a bone marrow biopsy. Evi- dence for viral infection could have been looked for by immunofluorescence staining for Epstein-Barr- virus or parvovirus antigen or by in situ hybridiza- tion for viral DNA. Parvovirus DNA could also have been looked for in the blood. I would not be sur- prised to learn that lymphoma or lymphoid prolif- eration suggestive of an \"early\" lymphoma was also found.\\nMy diagnosis is erythroid aplasia due to B19 parvo- virus or Epstein-Barr virus.\\nDR. WILLIAM S. BECK: You suggested that the pa- tient\\'s methemoglobinemia may have contributed to the anemia. In my experience, methemoglobinemia itself, whether congenital or acquired because of oxi- dant stress, does not cause anemia — hemolytic or otherwise. In some patients erythrocytosis develops, as an erythropoietin-stimulated bone marrow seeks to compensate for a nonfunctioning hemoglobin. Only when overwhelming oxidant stress produces both met- hemoglobin and Heinz bodies does \"bite cell\" hemo- lytic anemia develop. There is nothing in this case record to suggest the presence of Heinz bodies or he- molysis, and I doubt that a methemoglobin level of 11.1 percent would contribute to anemia in the ab- sence of Heinz bodies, bite cells, or laboratory evi- dence of hemolysis. It is true that the patient was taking primaquine, but there is no evidence that he had glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.\\nAlso, your argument that parvovirus B19 caused the anemia and neutropenia is convincing, but usually erythroid precursor cells are the only targets of this virus, with a clinical picture of pure red-cell aplasia or erythroblastopenia rather than white-cell apla- sia. Only recently, a pure recurrent granulocytic apla- sia attributed to parvovirus B19 was considered worth reporting. 24 Do you believe that the virus affected both red-cell and white-cell precursors in this patient?\\nDR. HELLER: In patients with HIV infection who are treated with dapsone, severe anemia occurs com- monly, and often it is associated with methemoglobi- nemia. I wonder whether the patient\\'s glucose-6-phos- phate dehydrogenase level was checked before the primaquine was administered. He had been taking dapsone for a long time, but severe methemoglobine- mia developed only after he was treated with the primaquine for the episode of pneumocystis infec- tion. Acute infection with the B19 parvovirus some- times causes pancytopenia, which is not very severe even in normal hosts, but the virus is one of the few viruses that cause bone marrow suppression or pancy- topenia with much greater involvement of the ery- throid line than of the other lines. Acute infection with most of the other viruses (e.g., cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus) very commonly causes mild pancytopenia.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nAnemia due to B19 parvovirus.\\nDR. HOWARD M. HELLER\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nErythroid aplasia due to B19 parvovirus or Ep- stein-Barr virus.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. JEFFERY S. DZIECZKOWSKI: The diagnostic pro- cedure was a staging bone marrow biopsy and as- piration. The marrow cellularity ranged from 30 to 80 percent and overall was approximately 70 per- cent. The myeloid:erythroid ratio was markedly in- creased, with normal maturation of the myeloid line. Erythroid precursors were decreased, and maturation was shifted to the left, with a marked decrease in mature forms. Scattered large basophilic cells with clear nuclei were found. Megakaryocytes were slight- ly increased but morphologically normal (Fig. 1). The iron level was increased. Special stains for acid- fast bacilli, fungi, and spirochetes and immunoperox- idase stains for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex antigens were negative. There was no necrosis, gran- uloma formation, or large-cell lymphoma.\\nExamination of the aspirate showed 80 percent myeloid cells, 12 percent erythroid cells, 3.5 percent lymphoid cells, 1 percent eosinophils, 1 percent mono- cytes, and 2.5 percent plasma cells. Only rare matur- ing erythroid cells were present; however, occasional giant pronormoblasts with clumped basophilic chro- matin and clear cytoplasmic vacuoles were identified (Fig. 2). The presence of these cells and the mor- phologic findings in the bone marrow biopsy specimen are characteristic of infection with the human parvo- virus B19.\\nThe diagnosis of human parvovirus B19 infection was confirmed by identifying the viral genetic material within the bone marrow. In situ hybridization with the use of sequence-specific DNA probes for parvo- virus B19 was performed by Dr. Christopher Crum from the Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital. The probe was made with the use of the polymerase chain reac- tion, to amplify parvovirus B19 DNA extracted from a clinical sample, and labeled with digoxigenin-11- deoxyuridine triphosphate. The hybridized probe was detected by the addition of anti-digoxigenin antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase, followed by the addition of substrate to obtain a chromogenic prod- uct. 25 Infected cells are identified by strongly positive hybridization signals within the nuclei, which are stained black (Fig. 2). This study confirmed the pres- ence of the parvovirus DNA within the bone marrow and hence the diagnosis.\\nThe name \"parvovirus\" is derived from the Latin word parvum, meaning small. This name is appropri- ate, since parvoviruses are the smallest known DNA viruses, composed of single-stranded DNA, and are 5.5 kb in length and 15 to 28 nm in diameter. 26 Human parvovirus was first identified in 1975 during the screening of blood for hepatitis B antigen by counter- immunoelectrophoresis. 27 A single strain has been identified worldwide, and the designation \"B19\" origi- nated from the laboratory code used to identify a par- ticular isolate. 28\\nParvoviruses depend on actively replicating cells to supply an unknown S-phase cellular function. The vi- rus shows tropism for erythroid precursors, and the rapidly dividing pronormoblast is particularly suscep- tible to infection. 29 The infected pronormoblast can be found in the bone marrow aspirate. The infected cell is enlarged, with basophilic nuclear chromatin, ampho- philic intranuclear inclusions, and cytoplasmic vacu- oles. Hematopoietic cells exposed to parvovirus B19 show decreased erythroid colony formation in vitro. Serum from persons who have recovered from parvo- virus infection can neutralize this inhibitory effect. 30 As is consistent with the in vitro findings, infected persons have a transient anemia due to a decrease in erythropoiesis. The anemia is usually mild and tran- sient and resolves with the production of virus-specific antibodies.\\nThe clinical manifestations of B19 infection vary with the age and hematologic and immunologic sta- tus of the patient. In utero infection can result in fetal anemia, which can lead to hydrops fetalis, spon- taneous abortion, and fetal malformations.31 Human parvovirus also causes erythema infectiosum (or fifth disease), a self-limited, erythematous childhood ill- ness that occurs most often between the ages of 5 and 15 years. Affected children have a charac- teristic facial rash described as having a \"slapped cheek\" appearance. In immunocompetent adults the infection is often asymptomatic, but fever, malaise, arthropathy, headache, myalgia, and vomiting may occur.\\nThe first disorder found to be associated with par- vovirus infection was aplastic crisis in children with sickle cell anemia. 32 Persons with impaired eryth- rocyte production or survival, such as those with sickle cell anemia, hereditary spherocytosis, β-thal- assemia, or pyruvate kinase deficiency, are at in- creased risk for the development of life-threatening aplastic crises when infected with the virus. The transient interruption of erythropoiesis can quickly lead to an aplastic crisis in these patients, whose mar- row function is already stressed.\\nImmunocompromised persons are also at risk for severe and persistent anemia as a result of parvovi- rus B19 infection. A number of patients immuno- suppressed by infection with HIV as well as che- motherapy, organ transplantation, and hematologic malignant tumors are susceptible to parvovirus B19 infection and its complications. Parvovirus infection resulting in hypoplastic anemia has been described in patients with HIV infection and AIDS. Red-cell apla- sia caused by parvovirus infection has been reported as an initial manifestation of HIV infection. 33 Immu- nocompromised patients with parvovirus infection can be supported with red-cell transfusions and intrave- nous immune globulin, which is effective in clearing the viremia and curing the anemia. 15,17 Immune glob- ulin contains antibodies from thousands of plasma donors, many likely to have been exposed to parvo- virus and to have produced virus-specific antibodies. The infused antibodies neutralize the virus and allow the resumption of normal hematopoiesis.\\nThis patient was seen in the outpatient area of the blood-transfusion service, where he received seven in- fusions of immune globulin, totaling 175 g, over a period of 32 days. Serum obtained before and after therapy was assayed for the presence of parvovirus B19 DNA and virus-specific antibodies. The viral DNA was detected by the quantitative dot blot hy- bridization; the lower limit of detection of this assay was 1 ng per milliliter. The pretreatment serum con- tained 150 ng of parvovirus DNA per milliliter, and the post-treatment serum contained less than 1 ng (Fig. 3).\\nWestern blot analysis was performed to detect parvovirus B19-specific IgG and IgM antibodies. The serum collected before infusion of immune globu- lin was weakly positive for IgG, and no IgM was de- tected. The post-treatment serum was positive for IgG, and again no IgM was detected. These laborato- ry results document the presence of viremia before immune globulin therapy, which subsequently cleared as the concentration of the virus-specific antibodies increased.\\nFurther indirect evidence of human parvovirus in- fection in this case is the improvement of the patient\\'s hematologic indexes after treatment with immune globulin. Before the diagnostic procedure he had re- ceived transfusions of 16 units of packed red cells over a three-month period. After the infusions of immune globulin began, the reticulocyte count increased and the hematocrit stabilized and increased without any additional red-cell transfusions (Fig. 4).\\nDR. NANCY L. HARRIS: Does the absence of IgM antibody suggest that this patient had been exposed to parvovirus infection previously but had lost his anti- body response and was subsequently reinfected?\\nDR. DZIECZKOWSKI: The absence of IgM antibod- ies and the presence of IgG antibodies in low con- centration when he was first seen in the outpatient transfusion area are consistent with chronic infec- tion or with reexposure to the virus.\\nDR. NESLI BASGOZ: Could the diagnosis have been made routinely without a bone marrow examination?\\nDR. DZIECZKOwskı: Hybridization techniques can document the presence of the virus in the serum. However, in immunocompetent patients the period of viremia is brief, as short as four days, and the patients usually present after the virus has cleared from the blood. In immunosuppressed patients viremia can be prolonged, and in those cases it is easier to document it in a serum sample.\\nADDENDUM\\nDR. PEGGY L. UEDA: Subsequent computed tomo- graphic (CT) scans of the chest and abdomen were negative for lymphoma. A CT scan of the brain showed a small focus of probable lymphoma in the thalamus, which was confirmed on magnetic reso- nance imaging. The patient received local radiation to the pharyngeal lesion and whole-brain radiation, with excellent results. Later examination of a biopsy speci- men from an enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node was negative for lymphoma and positive for M. avium complex. Treatment with zidovudine was attempted after treatment of the parvovirus infection but was discontinued because of anemia. The patient has re- quired additional blood transfusions. He has started to take an experimental nucleoside analogue called stavudine. Six months after the diagnosis of lympho- ma he is apparently free of lymphoma and leading an active life.',\n",
       " 'A 70-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for further management of a myocardial infarct.\\nThe patient had been well until three days earlier, when substernal pain developed and was accompanied by mild dyspnea, without nausea, vomiting, sweating, or radiation of pain. He was taken to another hospital within 1½ hours, where laboratory studies showed that the urea nitrogen was 47 mg (17 mmol per liter) and the creatinine 2.4 mg per deciliter (210 µmol per liter). An electrocardiogram revealed an evolving anteroseptal myocardial infarct. Nitroglycerin, morphine sulfate, aspirin, atenolol, and streptokinase (1.5 million U by vein) were given, with a considerable decrease in the chest pain after one hour. Two bouts of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurred, and lidocaine was administered by vein; during the second bout the blood pressure fell briefly to 80/50 mm Hg. The patient\\'s chest pain subsided, and the electrocardiographic changes largely resolved. On the fourth hospital day mild anterior chest pain recurred and disappeared soon after the rate of an intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin was increased. On the same day the patient was transferred to this hospital, receiving aspirin, atenolol, ranitidine, heparin (12,500 U every 12 hours subcutaneously), and an intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin.\\nThere was a 10-year history of hypertension, which was controlled with propranolol and chlorothiazide; the patient also had hyperlipidemia. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years but discontinued the practice 35 years before admission. He had experienced infrequent episodes of exertional angina pectoris during the year or two before admission. A cerebral transient ischemic attack manifested by numbness of the right arm for about 10 minutes had occurred several months before admission and again four weeks before entry. The patient had prostatism, with nocturia (urinating three times a night), hesitancy, and dribbling. He denied peripheral edema, palpitations, and diabetes mellitus. His father and a brother had died of myocardial infarcts in their 60s.\\nThe temperature was 37°C, the pulse was 73, and the respirations were 16. The blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg.\\nOn physical examination the head and neck were normal; the carotid pulses were + + and equal, without bruits; the jugular venous pressure was normal. The lungs were clear, and the heart sounds were normal. Examination of the abdomen was negative. There was no peripheral edema; the dorsalis pedis pulses were + + bilaterally. Rectal examination revealed moderate prostatic enlargement, without nodules; a stool specimen contained occult blood (+ test). Neurologic examination was negative.\\nThe urine was normal except for a trace-positive test for protein. The hematologic and blood chemical values throughout the hospital course are shown in Tables 1 and 2. An electrocardiogram demonstrated a normal rhythm at a rate of 62, with an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. X-ray films of the chest were normal.\\nAspirin, atenolol, cimetidine, isosorbide dinitrate, and heparin (12,500 U subcutaneously every 12 hours) were administered. The patient remained free of cardiac symptoms during the first seven days in the hospital; no ectopy or arrhythmia was observed on a cardiac monitor. The temperature rose infrequently as high as 37.7°C. The blood pressure was generally approximately 125/65 mm Hg. In a 24-hour specimen of urine the creatinine excretion was 1100 ml, and the protein 189 mg; the serum creatinine was 4.0 mg per deciliter (350 µmol per liter). No oliguria or polyuria was observed at any time. On the second hospital day an electrocardiogram revealed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 55 and was unchanged. On the fourth hospital day a resting thallium scan revealed fixed apical thinning; no evidence of redistribution was observed on images obtained at three hours.\\nOn the following day a cardiac ultrasonographic study showed segmental left ventricular dysfunction consistent with anterior and inferior infarcts and calcification of the posterior mitral annulus; the left atrium and left ventricle were of normal size; the estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.60; there was Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid and pulmonic regurgitation; the right ventricular systolic pressure was estimated to be 35 mm Hg.\\nOn the sixth hospital day the patient was awakened by severe pain in the right fifth toe. Physical examination showed erythema of the toe, with tenderness of the distal interphalangeal joint; the dorsalis pedis pulses were preserved. Colchicine was administered by mouth. A renal ultrasonographic examination showed that the right kidney was approximately 9 cm long and the left 10.5 cm, with moderate bilateral cortical atrophy; no hydronephrosis, perinephric-fluid accumulation, or focal renal lesion was seen (Fig. 1). Radiographs of the right foot were normal. A radionuclide renographic examination, performed after the intravenous injection of [99mTc] pentetic acid, revealed a slightly asymmetric decrease in perfusion and in the glomerular filtration rate; approximately 55 percent of glomerular filtration was performed by the left kidney, and the remainder by the right kidney. On the eighth hospital day chest pain recurred for the first time. An electrocardiogram was unchanged. Examination of the right foot showed slight swelling about the bed of the fifth toenail, with a dusky appearance of the plantar surface. Colchicine was discontinued, and dicloxacillin was begun. On the following day examination disclosed irregular purpuric macules over the plantar surfaces of both feet, including the distal portions of several toes, more pronounced in the right foot; there was livido reticularis of the right thigh and upper calf; the dorsalis pedis pulses were full and equal.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. ANDREW J. KING*: In summary, this 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, angina, and transient ischemic attacks presented with myocardial infarction and azotemia. He received thrombolytic therapy followed by anticoagulation with heparin and aspirin. His course at this hospital was notable for an acute rise in the urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, recurrent angina, and the onset of painful erythema of the right fifth toe, lower-extremity livedo reticularis, and macular purpura on both feet. May we review the renal radiologic studies?\\nDR. NICHOLAS PAPANICOLAOU: The ultrasonograms, which were obtained on the sixth hospital day (Fig. 1), disclose moderate bilateral renal cortical atrophy, without hydronephrosis or focal lesions. The radionuclide renograms show a symmetric decrease in perfusion, with diminution of the glomerular filtration rate. The split glomerular filtration rate was estimated to be 55 percent for the left kidney and 45 percent for the right kidney. The transit time of the radionuclide through the kidneys was normal.\\nDR. KING: The first question to be addressed is whether the elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine levels on presentation to the referring hospital indicated renal disease unrelated to the subsequent fall in the glomerular filtration rate. This determination would have been greatly facilitated by obtaining historical values for these indexes. The base-line urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were presumably obtained about 1½ hours after the onset of pain, an interval too short to attribute the elevated values solely to prerenal azotemia caused by a reduction in the cardiac output. If the creatinine level of 2.4 mg per deciliter before the myocardial infarction was a steady-state value, his estimated creatinine clearance was in the range of 30 to 40 ml per minute, indicating substantial renal insufficiency. In general, one must first determine whether there is an intrinsic renal disorder or a problem with renal perfusion (prerenal) or urinary drainage (postrenal).\\nIn determining the chronicity of insufficiency, one relies heavily on the history and an assessment of renal cortical thickness. In this patient the presence of bilateral cortical atrophy shown on the ultrasound study argues strongly for preexisting chronic renal disease. Despite the history of prostatism I shall exclude obstructive uropathy because of the absence of evidence of hydronephrosis on the ultrasound study. Proteinuria is the hallmark of a glomerular disorder, and thus the mild elevation in the urinary protein excretion rate of 189 mg per 24 hours suggests a vascular or interstitial disorder rather than a glomerular disorder. There is no history of analgesic abuse, exposure to toxin or heavy metal, or a granulomatous or rheumatologic disorder to support a diagnosis of chronic interstitial disease. Therefore, I shall focus my attention on possible vascular disorders to account for the cortical atrophy.\\nThe patient had a 10-year history of hypertension, raising the possibility of benign nephrosclerosis, which involves both large and small renal arteries, with progressive hyalinization of the arterioles and small arteries, glomerular hypoperfusion, and ischemic atrophy.¹ Benign nephrosclerosis is typically accompanied by mild proteinuria (<1 g per 24 hours), although occasionally the proteinuria can be in the nephrotic range (>3 g per 24 hours). A survey for target-organ damage would provide support for this diagnosis. We are not given the results of a funduscopic examination, but the echocardiographic study failed to reveal left ventricular hypertrophy, suggesting that the blood pressure had been adequately controlled. An alternative vascular disorder is bilateral atherosclerotic renovascular disease. This diagnosis is supported by the evidence of large-vessel disease in the coronary and cerebral circulation, the discrepancy in kidney size, which is slightly greater than the expected discrepancy of approximately 1 cm, the asymmetry shown on the renal scan, and the late onset of the hypertension at 60 years of age. This patient, however, had neither carotid nor abdominal bruits and had no signs or symptoms of peripheral vascular disease, both of which frequently accompany renovascular atherosclerotic disease. The absence of severe hypertension does not eliminate the possibility of bilateral renal-artery stenosis. 2,3 Indeed, in one prospective study of 100 patients who underwent angiography for peripheral vascular disease, nearly a quarter of the normotensive patients had bilateral renal-artery stenosis with over 50 percent occlusion.³ In summary, benign nephrosclerosis and bilateral renalartery stenosis are two strong possibilities that would account for the chronic renal insufficiency, but neither would explain the acute renal failure or the cutaneous findings.\\nOn admission to this hospital three days after the myocardial infarction the creatinine level had increased from 2.4 to 3.0 mg per deciliter, the urea nitrogen had increased from 47 to 56 mg per deciliter, and the urinary sediment was trace-positive for protein and devoid of cells or casts. The change in the creatinine level had occurred before the initiation of cimetidine, an organic cation that competes with creatinine for renal tubular secretion and in the absence of evidence of an increase in creatinine production; therefore, the increased creatinine level reflected a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate. Subsequent values for urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were similarly increased or even higher, thereby establishing the diagnosis of acute renal failure. A pattern of worsening azotemia with an \"inactive\" urinary sediment in a patient in a hospital should prompt a careful evaluation for hemodynamic causes of acute renal failure. Indeed, renal hypoperfusion is the most frequent cause of acute renal failure in such patients, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the cases. This patient\\'s history and physical examination revealed no overt cause of \"prerenal\" azotemia, such as volume contraction or congestive heart failure. Despite the recent myocardial infarction and wall-motion abnormalities he had an ejection fraction of 60 percent, a finding weighing against hypoperfusion due to a reduced cardiac output. A reduction in renal-perfusion pressure is another important hemodynamic factor that must be evaluated, particularly in the setting of an intensivecare unit. Patients who have preexisting conditions that interfere with autoregulation of renal blood flow, such as renal-artery stenosis or longstanding poorly controlled hypertension, may be particularly sensitive to reductions in perfusion pressure even in the \"normal\" ranges. This patient was at high risk for preexisting renovascular disease, and his mean arterial blood pressure of 80 to 85 mm Hg may have been inadequate to maintain an optimal renal blood-flow rate and glomerular filtration rate. Finally, the evaluation should have included a survey for drugs with renal vasoactive effects, such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Aspirin treatment was started at admission; the dose is not stated, but in general low doses do not substantially impair renal prostaglandin production and are well tolerated by patients who have had myocardial infarction. Although his low renal-perfusion pressure may have contributed to the reduction in the glomerular filtration rate, it fails to account for the subsequent livedo reticularis and purpuric rash, leading me to consider less common disorders of glomerular hypoperfusion, including microvascular thrombosis, systemic vasculitis, and atheroembolic disease.\\nDisorders that lead to microvascular thrombosis, including the hemolytic uremic syndrome and primary anticardiolipin disease, may present with acute renal failure and purpura. This patient had no history of thrombosis or evidence of underlying systemic lupus erythematosus to support a diagnosis of anticardiolipin disease. The hemolytic uremic syndrome is characterized by the appearance of microthrombi composed of platelets and fibrin, which may occlude glomerular capillaries, arterioles, and small arteries. The urinary sediment is commonly \"inactive,\" although an \"active\" sediment with red cells and occasionally red-cell casts has been documented. Other findings include mucoid intimal thickening of the interlobular arteries, which may further compromise glomerular perfusion. Several factors are against this diagnosis, including the lack of a history of a prodromal illness, the minimal fever, the normal platelet count, and the absence of neurologic dysfunction. Although there was mild elevation in the lactate dehydrogenase level, there was no other evidence of a hemolytic process, such as may be observed on a blood smear. Thus, I believe that microangiopathy of this type is very unlikely.\\nWhen the possibility of systemic vasculitis as a cause of acute renal failure is addressed, several questions must be considered. Is there evidence of a systemic disorder? What is the pattern of organ involvement? What is the size of the vessels involved? Vasculitis is a multiorgan disease. The renal manifestations depend largely on the size of the target vessel and the extent of inflammation and occlusion.6,7 Forms of vasculitis that primarily involve capillaries and venules, such as Wegener\\'s granulomatosis and microscopic polyarteritis nodosa, typically present with an acute glomerulonephritis manifested by an \"active\" sediment, including red cells and red-cell casts, and proteinuria. Renal biopsy reveals focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis, with negative immunofluorescence examination; inflamed vessels are rarely observed. An \"active\" sediment is also common in disorders of medium-sized arteries, such as polyarteritis nodosa, and is occasionally observed in large-vessel forms of vasculitis. Nevertheless, vasculitis of medium and large vessels may lead to incomplete luminal occlusion, resulting in glomerular hypoperfusion, a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate, reninmediated hypertension, and an \"inactive” urinary sediment. The renal disorder in the patient under discussion would fit into the latter category, since his sediment was devoid of red cells or casts, suggesting glomerular ischemia and not necrosis. Although vasculitis involving large vessels, such as temporal arteritis and Takayasu\\'s arteritis, can rarely include renal involvement and renovascular hypertension, the clinical features do not fit. Therefore, I shall concentrate my discussion on the possibility of diseases of medium arteries — specifically, \"classic\" polyarteritis nodosa.\\n\"Classic\" polyarteritis nodosa is exceedingly rare and in most patients overlaps with microscopic polyarteritis nodosa, which involves small arteries, capillaries, and venules. Unlike Wegener\\'s granulomatosis or microscopic polyarteritis nodosa, in which the titers of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are frequently elevated, the role of these antibodies as a serologic marker for \"classic\" polyarteritis nodosa is less clear.8 We are given very little evidence from the case record of a systemic disorder before the patient\\'s myocardial infarction other than atherosclerosis. Specifically, there was no mention of fever, weight loss, or other somatic problems, each of which occurs in roughly 70 percent of patients with polyarteritis nodosa. 9-11 Physical examination and laboratory studies failed to reveal multisystem involvement. There was no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or central neurologic dysfunction, which occurs in up to 70 to 80 percent of patients with polyarteritis nodosa. 11,12 Although polyarteritis nodosa affects the heart in 10 to 30 percent of the cases, the involvement is manifested more commonly as congestive heart failure than as angina or myocardial infarction. 10,11 In view of the patient\\'s multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic disease and the extended history of his angina (one to two years), it is very unlikely that the myocardial infarction was due to coronary vasculitis. During the hospital course he had an infrequent, low-grade fever, and lower-extremity livedo reticularis and macular purpura developed. Cutaneous manifestations of polyarteritis nodosa occur in 20 to 30 percent of the patients and are usually tender subcutaneous nodules. 10,11,13,14 Both livedo reticularis (3 to 25 percent of the cases) 9-11 and less commonly purpuric lesions have been described. In summary, polyarteritis nodosa can lead to acute renal failure with an \"inactive\" sediment, livedo reticularis, and purpura and remains a diagnostic possibility in this case, but the common features of the \"vasculitic syndrome\" were absent. 5,6\\nSeveral findings in this patient\\'s history point to a diagnosis of atheroembolic disease, for which he had many of the well-recognized risk factors. Specifically, he was an elderly hypertensive man with preexisting cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and possibly renovascular atherosclerotic disease. In a retrospective study of 221 patients with atheroembolic disease described in the literature from 1965 to 1985, Fine et al. 15 noted that 76 percent of the cases were in elderly men (mean age, 66 years). On presentation the frequency of hypertension was 61 percent, that of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was 44 percent, that of aortic aneurysm was 25 percent, and that of renal failure was 34 percent. This patient received streptokinase and heparin therapy, which may have precipitated a shower of atheromatous emboli, resulting in the reduction in the glomerular filtration rate three days after his myocardial infarction. The purple-toe syndrome associated with warfarin therapy was first described by Feder and Auerbach 16 in 1961. Although it was initially believed to be a toxic effect of warfarin, subsequent reports indicated that it is caused by showers of atheroemboli, which generally occur after three weeks to three months of the therapy. 17,18 In contrast, several reports of atheromatous emboli temporally related to thrombolytic therapy with either streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator, or both, indicate a more rapid onset of embolic disease, usually within one week. 19-23 It is believed that anticoagulants expose ulcerated atherosclerotic plaques by disrupting the superimposed platelet-fibrin thrombi. 18,24 The most common precipitant of these emboli is mechanical disruption due to catheterization of a diseased aorta. The frequency of disease related to either anticoagulation or angiographic procedures is difficult to assess. However, in one autopsy report of patients who died within six months after an angiographic examination, 30 percent of those who had had an aortographic study had atheromatous emboli principally involving the kidneys and spleen, whereas 26 percent of those who had had a coronary angiographic study had emboli mostly involving the coronary arteries. 25 A control group with equally severe atherosclerotic disease and no angiographic examination had only a 4 percent frequency of atheromatous emboli identified at autopsy. Finally, spontaneous embolism, occasionally associated with trauma, has been well documented. 15,26 That observation raises the possibility of previous showers of atheroemboli leading to this patient\\'s antecedent renal insufficiency. Although rare, both transient ischemic attacks and myocardial infarction due to atheromatous emboli have been reported. 15,26,27 In this regard, a careful funduscopic examination might have revealed the characteristic refractile plaques described by Hollenhorst. 28\\nThe pattern of renal disease in this patient is fully consistent with atheroemboli. 29 The irregularly shaped, nondistensible emboli typically lodge in the arcuate, interlobular, and other terminal arteries, leading to incomplete occlusion and glomerular ischemia. The urinary sediment of this patient with + proteinuria and no cells or casts is typical. Occasionally, smaller fragments result in glomerular inflammation, with an \"active\" sediment and rarely nephrotic-range proteinuria. The patient\\'s creatinine level stabilized during the hospital course. Indeed, the pattern of renal dysfunction may offer an important clue for differentiating atheroembolic disease from other forms of acute renal failure, such as acute tubular necrosis. Patients with atheromatous emboli typically have stepwise increments in the serum creatinine level, with intervals of stable function, whereas those with acute tubular necrosis have a slow rise and a subsequent fall in the creatinine level. 30 The former sequence may be attributed to repeated showers of emboli or to the progressive vascular lesion induced by the emboli. Indeed, over time there is a local inflammatory response, with infiltration by macrophages and multinucleated giant cells, which may progress to complete vessel occlusion and renal infarction. 29 Unfortunately, many patients have an inexorable progression to end-stage renal disease; occasional patients have gradual improvement over a long period. I have been caring for one such patient, who required dialysis for nine months and now has a creatinine level of 3.5 mg per deciliter two years after the embolism. In patients with atheroemboli induced by an angiographic procedure the improvement may be due to resolution of concurrent nephropathy induced by contrast material.\\nMultiorgan involvement is typical of atheroembolic disease; for this reason, other multisystem disorders such as polyarteritis nodosa are always considered. 15,31 In the case under discussion the stool contained occult blood, and there were cutaneous findings. No abdominal symptoms were reported, but pancreatitis is common with atheroembolism. In addition, a variety of hemorrhagic disorders of the gut, including bowel ischemia and infarction, have been described. 15,32 The cutaneous manifestations arise from disruption of normal skin perfusion and are observed in approximately 35 percent of the cases. 33 Usually, though not always, the findings are bilateral and limited to the lower extremities. Livedo reticularis occurs in 50 percent of patients with cutaneous findings and is caused by the juxtaposition of well-perfused skin with areas of impaired perfusion. In descending order of frequency, other cutaneous findings include gangrene (35 percent), cyanosis (28 percent), ulceration (17 percent), purple toes (11 percent), nodules (10 percent), and purpura (9 percent). 33 These lesions are frequently painful and very difficult to treat. Although preservation of pedal pulses with lower-extremity cyanosis is generally a tip-off to the diagnosis of atheroemboli, pedal pulses are diminished or absent in roughly 40 percent of the patients because of the high prevalence of concurrent peripheral vascular disease. 33 In the patient under discussion, the laboratory findings at admission yielded few clues to the diagnosis of atheroembolic disease except for a slight increase in the calculated eosinophil count. Eosinophilia has been reported in up to 80 percent of the patients, but it is often transient.30 It would be interesting to know whether it developed on the seventh and eighth hospital days concurrently with the onset of livedo and purpura. Decreased complement levels have been reported by some observers but not confirmed by others. 34-36\\nThe diagnosis of atheroembolic disease can generally be made on clinical grounds alone. Although a closed renal biopsy is frequently diagnostic, it is not optimal because of the small sample and the relatively high complication rate. If there is lower-extremity involvement skin and muscle biopsies are safe, and skin biopsies are diagnostic in up to 90 percent of the cases. 33,37 The sensitivity of these tests is markedly improved by examining multiple microscopical sections.\\nIn summary, this patient presented with myocardial infarction and chronic renal insufficiency perhaps related to atherosclerotic renovascular disease, benign nephrosclerosis, or previous atheroemboli. The streptokinase and heparin therapy precipitated a shower of atheromatous emboli, leading to acute renal failure, livedo reticularis, lower-extremity purpura, and painful purple toes. Before proceeding to a tissue biopsy I would have performed a careful funduscopic examination looking for Hollenhorst plaques, and if it was negative I would have advocated a biopsy of the lower skin and muscle.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Dr. Fang, will you give us your impressions before the diagnostic procedure?\\nDR. LESLIE S.-T. FANG: At the time of admission there were no cutaneous manifestations to suggest atheromatous emboli. However, the clinical course and the benign urinary sediment led us to consider that disorder precipitated by streptokinase administration. The diagnostic procedure was a biopsy of the skin of the right foot.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nAtheromatous embolism.\\nDR. ANDREW J. KING\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nAtheroembolic disease of kidneys, skin, and gastrointestinal tract.\\n? Benign nephrosclerosis.\\n? Bilateral renal-artery atherosclerosis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. J. ANDREW Carlson: Examination of the biopsy specimen revealed occlusion of the lumen of a small subcutaneous muscular artery by acellular eosinophilic material and several biconvex clefts surrounded by macrophages, diagnostic of atheromatous embolism (Fig. 2).\\nAtheromatous embolism is only now being recognized as a rare complication of thrombolytic therapy. 38,39 Twenty-two such cases have been reported19-23,40-49, 16 of them were confirmed histologically, 19-23,40-47 and the remainder were diagnosed clinically. 48,49 The ages of the patients ranged from 38 to 70 years (average, 59); 18 patients had been treated with streptokinase, and 3 with alteplase (tissue plasminogen activator); 19 patients had been treated for myocardial ischemia, 2 for deep venous thrombosis, and I for pulmonary embolism. Eight patients had a history of hypertension. In only 621,41,43,46,47 of the 22 cases was an additional putative causal factor such as anticoagulant therapy or a left-sided cardiac catheterization, or both, involved. 17,38 Symptoms developed in eight patients within 24 hours, in seven patients from 1 to 7 days, and in seven patients from 7 to 35 days. Livedo reticularis was described in 15 cases, the purple-toe syndrome in 15, acute renal failure in 15, lower-extremity myalgias in 11, abdominal pain in 1, and acute visceral ischemia in 1. Seven patients died of their disease, chronic renal failure developed in five patients, one patient required digital amputations, and the signs and symptoms improved in nine patients. Severe ulcerative atherosclerosis of the aorta was identified in four cases by postmortem examination and in three cases by imaging studies. These clinical and pathological findings fall within the spectrum of atheroembolic disease found in other settings, although the mortality of 31 percent is less than that of 81 percent and 62 percent found in reviews of 221 cases15 and 22 cases,5º respectively, in which it was not associated with thrombolytic therapy. 50 The frequency of atheromatous embolism in association with thrombolytic therapy has not been addressed in the literature but is probably low. In a report by Stafford et al.49 only 7 (1.5 percent) of 475 consecutive patients treated with thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction had embolic complications.\\nDR. FANG: Now that thrombolytic therapy is being offered to older and sicker patients, this complication will probably be seen more frequently. We cannot always assess the contribution of thrombolytic therapy to the disorder, since some patients have also had a coronary angiographic examination and coronary angioplasty.\\nDr. King has indicated that heparin therapy may accentuate the injury due to atheroemboli. This patient was receiving heparin for unstable angina. Dr. King, how would you have managed heparin therapy in this situation?\\nDR. KING: I would have discontinued it in this patient. It is clearly a difficult decision because of the high risk of recurrent myocardial infarction, and the management of the patient\\'s care might have necessitated emergency cardiac evaluation and intervention. However, there are reports that stopping heparin therapy can halt atheroembolic showers. 24 In patients at high risk who have diffuse atherosclerosis, catheterization through an upper extremity should be considered, because aortic atherosclerotic disease is the primary source of atheroemboli. However, to date there are no conclusive data to support this approach.\\nDR. FANG: We have been recommending to our angiographer that the upper-extremity approach be used in patients at high risk for atheroembolism. However, traversing the aortic arch in a patient at high risk can also create a problem. Patients can have cerebral emboli as well as distal emboli.\\nDR. MARK: Dr. Fang, what has happened to the patient?\\nDR. FANG: This patient\\'s old records indicate that the creatinine level was 1.8 mg per deciliter two years before admission and 2.1 mg per deciliter six months before admission. This elevation was believed to be caused by nephrosclerosis, with possible renovascular disease. During the hospital course the proportion of eosinophils remained between 4 and 6 percent. The sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour on admission and rose as high as 79 mm per hour. During the patient\\'s hospital course his cardiac status stabilized, but his creatinine level slowly rose to about 4.2 mg per deciliter, and he was transferred to a hospital closer to his home. The creatinine level continued to rise, and he required short-term hemodialysis, which was eventually discontinued. Subsequently, the creatinine level gradually fell to about 2.0 mg per deciliter. Unfortunately, unstable angina again developed, and he required repeated catheterization and coronary angioplasty. His renal function again deteriorated, but the serum creatinine level eventually leveled off at 3.2 mg per deciliter.',\n",
       " 'A 38-year-old man with the acquired immunodefi-\\nciency syndrome (AIDS) was admitted to the hospital\\nbecause of abdominal pain and bleeding from the\\nrectum.\\nTwo-and-a-half years earlier Pneumocystis carinii\\npneumonia had developed, and the diagnosis of AIDS\\nwas established. The patient recovered and entered a\\nstudy that compared zidovudine with didanosine.\\nEight months before entry he returned to the hospital\\nbecause of chronic fatigue and was found to have cyto-\\nmegalovirus colitis. Ganciclovir was begun, and he\\nwas discharged improved.\\nTwo months before entry the patient was readmit-\\nted because of worsening fatigue, fever, and exertional\\ndyspnea. Radiographs of the chest showed ill-defined\\nlinear opacities at both lung bases; the appearance\\nwas improved in comparison with films obtained 28\\nmonths earlier. Computed tomographic (CT) scan-\\nning of the abdomen, performed after the oral admin-\\nistration of contrast material, was negative except\\nfor enlargement of the left adrenal gland, slight en-\\nlargement of the pancreatic head, and slight strand-\\ning of the adjacent fat; the liver, spleen, and bowel\\nwere normal. The fasting serum cortisol concentra-\\ntion was 14.8 µg per deciliter (410 nmol per liter);\\n45 minutes after the injection of cosyntropin the cor-\\ntisol concentration was 43.7 µg per deciliter (1210\\nnmol per liter). Examination with a fiberoptic bron-\\nchoscope and bronchoalveolar lavage yielded evidence\\nof cytomegalovirus pneumonitis; the organism was\\nresistant to ganciclovir. Foscarnet was begun, and\\nthe patient was withdrawn from the antiretroviral\\nstudy. He was discharged improved on the 26th hospi-\\ntal day on a regimen of foscarnet with supplemental\\ncalcium.\\nFoscarnet was discontinued after four weeks. There-\\nafter the patient felt well until the morning of admis-\\nsion, when he experienced crampy abdominal pain\\nafter lifting a heavy object. During the afternoon he\\npassed small amounts of fresh blood per rectum, with-\\nout stool, accompanied by anorexia and nausea. He\\nwas readmitted.\\nThe patient was a homosexual in a monogamous\\nrelationship with a partner who was understood to\\nhave negative tests for human immunodeficiency virus\\n(HIV). There was a three-month history of an anal\\nfistula, which was not known to have bled. He had had\\noral thrush, molluscum contagiosum, and one bout of\\nparoxysmal atrial fibrillation and had lesions of Ka-\\nposi\\'s sarcoma. There was no history of recent fever,\\nchills, sweats, headache, previous bleeding per rec-\\ntum, rectal pain or proctitis, rectal intercourse or trau-\\nma, or recent travel. His only current medication was\\naerosolized pentamidine.\\nThe temperature was 38.2°C, the pulse was 90, and\\nthe respirations were 20. The blood pressure was\\n125/80 mm Hg.\\nOn examination the patient was doubled over with\\nabdominal pain. Lesions of Kaposi\\'s sarcoma were\\nobserved on the face, neck, hip, and both feet. No\\nlymphadenopathy was found. The lungs and heart\\nwere normal. Abdominal examination disclosed hy-\\npoactive bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness on deep\\npalpation except in the epigastrium, without guarding\\nor rebound tenderness; the liver and spleen were not\\nfelt. The extremities were normal. Rectal examination\\nrevealed a small anal fistula, without evidence of\\nbleeding; there was mild tenderness on palpation of\\nthe rectum, and no stool specimen was obtained. Neu-\\nrologic examination was negative.\\nThe urine was trace positive for protein; the sedi-\\nment contained 2 white cells, 2 red cells, and a few\\nbacteria per high-power field. The results of laborato-\\nry testing during the hospital course are presented in\\nTables 1 and 2; the levels of urea nitrogen, creatinine,\\ncalcium, protein (albumin and globulin), bilirubin, al-\\nkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, cre-\\natine kinase, and amylase were normal. Radiographs\\nof the chest were unchanged. X-ray films of the abdo-\\nmen disclosed a paucity of gas, without evidence of\\nintestinal obstruction or free intraperitoneal air.\\nThe patient passed a small amount of grossly\\nbloody stool, and a specimen was sent for culture.\\nFluids and magnesium sulfate were administered by\\nvein, and meperidine was injected intramuscularly to\\ncontrol pain. During the evening the patient passed\\napproximately 100 ml of fresh blood per rectum and\\nvomited bile-stained fluid, which was positive for oc-\\ncult blood.\\nIn the early morning of the second hospital day the\\npatient had increasing abdominal pain, passed 100 ml\\nof blood by rectum, and vomited bile-stained liquid\\nthat was positive for occult blood; a shaking chill de-\\nveloped. Specimens of blood were obtained for cul-\\nture, and vancomycin, gentamicin, and metronidazole\\nwere begun by vein; packed red cells were transfused.\\nThe temperature was 38.3°C. The abdomen was rigid,\\nwith absence of bowel sounds and diffuse and rebound\\ntenderness and guarding, which were maximal in the\\nlower abdomen. The patient passed 200 to 300 ml of\\ngross blood per rectum during the morning. Later the\\nblood pressure fell to 100 mm Hg systolic; additional\\nfluids were administered, and the systolic blood pres-\\nsure rose to 120 mm Hg. Sodium bicarbonate was\\nadministered by vein, and foscarnet was resumed.\\nA specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the pa-\\ntient was breathing room air, showed that the partial\\npressure of oxygen was 90.1 mm Hg, the partial pres-\\nsure of carbon dioxide 20 mm Hg, and the pH 7.40.\\nThe levels of urea nitrogen and creatinine were nor-\\nmal. Radiographs of the chest showed low lung vol-\\numes and subsegmental atelectasis at both bases. An\\nabdominal radiograph revealed dilute contrast mate-\\nrial in the small bowel, which was dilated to 4 cm; a\\nfew air-fluid levels were seen on a decubitus view,\\nwithout evidence of free intraperitoneal air. A CT\\nscan of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 1), obtained\\nafter the oral administration of contrast material, dis-\\nclosed no change in the left adrenal enlargement; no\\nlymphadenopathy was observed; there was marked\\nthickening of the cecum and ascending and transverse\\ncolon, with slight thickening of the descending sig-\\nmoid colon; diverticula were evident in the sigmoid\\nregion; there was marked inflammatory stranding in\\nthe mesentery and in the pericolic tissues, with exten-\\nsion to the duodenum and the uncinate process of the\\npancreas; free fluid was present in the pelvis and\\naround the liver; no free intraperitoneal air was ob-\\nserved.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed. : \\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. DEBORAH J. COTTON*: May we review the ra-\\ndiologic studies?\\nDR. WILLIAM MAYO-SMITH: A CT scan of the abdo-\\nmen, obtained two months before admission, was nor-\\nmal except for left adrenal enlargement.\\nThe plain film of the abdomen taken on admission\\nreveals a paucity of intraabdominal gas, without evi-\\ndence of free air, obstruction, or an intraabdominal\\nmass. The abdominal CT scan (Fig. 1), obtained on\\nthe second hospital day, shows ascites, marked mural\\nthickening in the ascending, transverse, and proxi-\\nmal descending colon, and inflammatory change of\\nthe paracolonic fat, without evidence of an intraab-\\ndominal mass, lymphadenopathy, or free air. The\\nsmall bowel, distal sigmoid colon, and rectum appear\\nnormal. There was no change in the left adrenal en-\\nlargement. The findings are consistent with colonic\\ninflammation, possibly caused by infection or pseudo-\\nmembranous colitis or, less likely, by typhlitis, neopla-\\nsia, or ischemia.\\nDR. COTTON: Although membranous gastrointesti-\\nnal disorders can occur in the course of HIV infection,\\nsubstantial hemorrhage and acute abdominal prob-\\nlems are uncommon.¹ Moreover, among HIV-infected\\npatients presenting with acute gastrointestinal emer-\\ngencies the causes are commonly unrelated to HIV\\ninfection. Recently, CT scanning has been used in-\\ncreasingly to evaluate acute abdominal problems.3 In\\nthis case the history and physical findings and CT-\\nscan findings are consistent with peritonitis and point\\nto the colon and possibly the small bowel as the pri-\\nmary sites of disease. Although it is not unusual for\\ntwo or more concurrent clinical disorders to be respon-\\nsible for symptoms in cases of HIV infection, I shall\\nfocus my discussion chiefly on disorders of the colon\\nthat could result in this clinical picture.\\nCould this patient have had inflammatory bowel\\ndisease unrelated to his HIV infection? He had an\\nanal fistula. However, he had no past history of ab-\\ndominal pain, no extraintestinal findings such as skin\\nor joint abnormalities, and no CT evidence of an in-\\ntestinal fistula to suggest Crohn\\'s disease. Ulcerative\\ncolitis with sparing of the rectosigmoid but intense\\ninvolvement of the rest of the colon would be unusual.\\nA fulminant presentation with hemorrhage is uncom-\\nmon with either disease. Intussusception can occur\\nwith AIDS, usually as a complication of opportunistic\\ninfection, but the CT scans showed no evidence of that\\ndisorder. The patient\\'s chronic fatigue and anemia are\\nconsistent with a right-sided adenocarcinoma, but he\\nwas young for that diagnosis and, unlike squamous-\\ncell carcinoma of the anus, adenocarcinoma has not\\nbeen reported with increased frequency among HIV-\\ninfected patients.\\nThis patient was found to have left-sided diverticula\\non the CT scan. Could additional undetected right-\\nsided diverticula have led to his illness? Hemorrhage\\nwould be more typical of diverticulosis, and peritoni-\\ntis would be more typical of diverticulitis; frank peri-\\ntonitis is unusual. No mass was palpable, and the\\nbowel-wall thickening shown on the CT scans was\\ndiffuse rather than focal.\\nAppendicitis should always be considered in a\\nyoung patient with an acute abdominal disorder.\\nHowever, there was no initial epigastric tenderness or\\nlocalized pain, although such signs may not occur in\\nan immunosuppressed patient. Hematochezia is un-\\nusual with appendicitis, and the CT scans in this case\\nsuggest more widespread intestinal involvement.\\nMycobacterium avium complex often causes infection\\nin patients with AIDS and could explain the gastroin-\\ntestinal bleeding, the adrenal enlargement, and the\\npossible pneumonitis. However, although the gastro-\\nintestinal involvement commonly causes diarrhea,\\nintestinal hemorrhage or perforation is infrequent.4\\nMoreover, systemic symptoms are characteristic of\\nthis disorder. Fatigue was prominent, but the patient\\nreported no recent fever or sweats. No lymphadenopa-\\nthy was detected on CT scanning, which would be\\nhighly unusual. Gastrointestinal tuberculosis is un-\\nlikely in view of the lack of a history of exposure, the\\nabsence of systemic symptoms, and the far more com-\\nmon occurrence of obstruction, stricture, and fistula\\nthan hemorrhage or perforation.\\nCould a systemic mycosis have been responsible for\\nthe patient\\'s manifestations? Isolated cryptococcal\\ndisease of the colon in the absence of meningeal, pul-\\nmonary, or skin involvement would be very unusual.\\nNorth American blastomycosis and coccidioidomyco-\\nsis rarely involve the gastrointestinal tract. Although\\nesophageal candidiasis is one of the more common\\nAIDS-defining conditions, invasive candidiasis of the\\nrest of the gastrointestinal tract is rare. Histoplasmo-\\nsis, however, is consistent with this patient\\'s presenta-\\ntion. Primary infection is seen frequently in HIV-\\ninfected patients in areas where the disease is endemic,\\noften presenting with a high fever, hypoxemia, the\\nadult respiratory distress syndrome, and disseminated\\nintravascular coagulation. However, a more chronic\\nform of disseminated histoplasmosis can occur in\\nHIV-infected patients as a result of reactivation of a\\nlatent focus in the presence of immunosuppression.5\\nThe patients may present with fatigue and malaise.\\nFever may be intermittent. Bone marrow suppression\\nis common. Oropharyngeal lesions provide an impor-\\ntant diagnostic clue but are not always present. Coli-\\ntis and bowel perforation\\' have been reported occa-\\nsionally. The adrenal glands are commonly involved,\\nand chronic pneumonitis may be seen. However, there\\nwas no history of travel to areas where histoplasmosis\\nis endemic; there was no lymphadenopathy, hepato-\\nsplenomegaly, or oropharyngeal lesion; and the CT\\nfindings suggest a diffuse rather than a focal lesion.\\nCould a virus or a complication of antiviral therapy\\nbe implicated in this case? Adenovirus as well as sever-\\nal novel viruses have been linked to diarrhea in pa-\\ntients with AIDS, but without enterocolitis. HIV in-\\nfection itself appears to cause esophageal and colonic\\nulcers, perhaps on an autoimmune basis, which re-\\nsolve with steroid therapy. However, the ulcers are\\ndiscrete, without an intense inflammatory process.\\nHerpes simplex infection is unlikely in the absence of\\nrectosigmoid involvement and because it is exquisitely\\nsensitive to foscarnet, which the patient had been re-\\nceiving.\\nOver two years had elapsed since the diagnosis of\\nP. carinii pneumonia in this case, putting the patient at\\nhigh risk of recurrence. Aerosolized pentamidine of-\\nfers no protection against extrapulmonary disease.\\nCould the primary gastrointestinal lesion have been a\\nfocus of P. carinii infection? Extrapulmonary P. carinii\\ninfection has rarely been reported, usually in the liver,\\nspleen, and lymph nodes. Both colitis¹ and gastroin-\\ntestinal perforation are rare, and other pathogens were\\npresent in the two cases with perforation.11\\nGastrointestinal non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphomas are\\ncommon with advanced HIV infection and frequently\\ncause hemorrhage or perforation. However, the ab-\\nsence of fever, weight loss, splenomegaly, and lym-\\nphadenopathy makes this diagnosis improbable. The\\npatient had cutaneous Kaposi\\'s sarcoma. Gastroin-\\ntestinal Kaposi\\'s lesions occur in at least half the pa-\\ntients with cutaneous disease. Although gastrointes-\\ntinal Kaposi\\'s sarcoma is usually asymptomatic, there\\nhave been reports of massive gastrointestinal hemor-\\nrhage, 12 colitis, 13 and gastrointestinal perforation.14 I\\nshall return to that diagnosis later.\\nBacterial enterocolitis caused by a variety of organ-\\nisms could account for many of the clinical findings in\\nthis case, and some of these pathogens are more com-\\nmon in HIV-infected patients, as well as HIV-nega-\\ntive homosexual men, than in the general population.\\nShigella, salmonella, campylobacter, Yersinia enteroco-\\nlitica, vibrio species, Escherichia coli, enteroinvasive or\\nenterotoxigenic E. coli, and even Staphylococcus aureus\\ncan cause severe enterocolitis with hemorrhage. Of\\nthese pathogens, salmonella is least likely to result in\\nsubstantial gastrointestinal blood loss except as a late\\ncomplication of typhoid fever. Y. enterocolitica infection\\ninvolves the small intestine more commonly and usu-\\nally presents with obstruction rather than hemorrhage\\nin the adult. Campylobacter infection can present as a\\ncolitis but more typically involves the upper gastroin-\\ntestinal tract and presents with bacteremia. Shigella\\nfrequently causes bloody diarrhea and is among the\\nmost common enteric pathogens in patients with\\nAIDS, but it too usually involves the small intestine.\\nMoreover, a prodrome with headache, malaise, or fe-\\nver would be expected with infection due to many of\\nthese pathogens. In this case the abrupt onset of pain\\nand bleeding in the absence of such a prodrome, as\\nwell as the absence of initial diarrhea and the relative\\nlack of diarrhea throughout the hospital course, are\\nagainst these bacterial forms of enterocolitis. How-\\never, intestinal carriage of multiple pathogens is com-\\nmon even among asymptomatic patients with AIDS,\\nand such organisms may have been present in this\\ncase without causing disease.\\nInfection with Entamoeba histolytica frequently causes\\nsevere colitis, which can present abruptly. However,\\namebic dysentery has been reported very rarely in\\nHIV-infected patients, despite a high frequency of\\nstool carriage. Cryptosporidia, Isospora belli, and mi-\\ncrosporidia are common causes of diarrhea in patients\\nwith AIDS, but these organisms chiefly affect the\\nsmall intestine, with voluminous diarrhea and malab-\\nsorption resulting in inanition. Toxoplasma colitis has\\nbeen reported in association with HIV infection but is\\nvery rare. 15 There was no eosinophilia or epidemiolog-\\nic history to suggest strongyloides infection, and giar-\\ndia infection would be unlikely to cause hemorrhage.\\nSeveral pathogens, including Chlamydia trachomatis\\nand Neisseria gonorrhoeae, are improbable because they\\nusually cause proctocolitis. Actinomycosis has been\\nseen infrequently in patients with AIDS and typically\\ninvolves the appendix alone. Nocardia infection has\\nbeen seen only rarely in patients with AIDS and usu-\\nally does not cause gastrointestinal disease.\\nCould this patient have had typhlitis, also referred\\nto as necrotizing enterocolitis? It has been described\\ntypically in neutropenic patients with cancer, occur-\\nring when chemotherapy-induced mucosal damage,\\noften coupled with antibiotic use, results in stasis and\\novergrowth of bacteria, leading to mucosal inflamma-\\ntion and ischemia. Typhlitis is usually confined to the\\ncecum, as suggested by the Greek word from which it\\nis derived typhlon, or \"blind sac.\" Sepsis is common,\\nand peritonitis often occurs, sometimes due to overt\\nperforation. Typhlitis can occur in patients with\\nAIDS, 16 some of whom, like this patient, have not had\\nneutropenia.17 However, those patients had been re-\\nceiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Also, clinical reso-\\nlution after appropriate antibiotics and supportive\\ncare was the sole basis for the diagnosis, without\\npathological confirmation. In this case there was\\napparent widespread abnormality of the colon, as\\njudged by the CT scan, rather than the typical local-\\nization to the cecum.\\nPseudomembranous colitis occurs frequently in pa-\\ntients with AIDS because of the large number of anti-\\nbiotics commonly taken. It can present fulminantly\\nwithout diarrhea 18,19 and with clinical signs of perito-\\nnitis. 20 Ascites and marked thickening of the colon,\\nidentical to that described in this case, are common.\\nHowever, abdominal distention, seen frequently with\\nthis acute presentation, was absent. Also, pseudo-\\nmembranous colitis is linked to previous antibiotic\\nuse or nosocomial acquisition during the hospital\\ncourse. This patient is not reported to have received\\nantibiotics recently except for aerosolized pentami-\\ndine and antiviral medications, and he had not been\\nadmitted to a hospital for at least one month. Aerosol-\\nized pentamidine does not appear in the blood or tis-\\nsue in appreciable concentrations outside the lung and\\nwould be highly unlikely to predispose the patient to\\npseudomembranous colitis. There is one report of the\\ndevelopment of pseudomembranous colitis in a pa-\\ntient treated with acyclovir and zidovudine but no\\nantibiotics, 21 but the patient under discussion had not\\ntaken zidovudine for two months, if at all. Foscarnet\\nand ganciclovir are not reported to have antibacterial\\nactivity. Pseudomembranous colitis usually involves\\nto some extent the rectosigmoid and descending colon,\\nwhich were relatively spared as demonstrated on the\\nCT scans in this case. 22 Patients may not recall or\\nreport antibiotic use, however. Although pseudomem-\\nbranous colitis was unlikely in this patient, since it is\\nreversible I would have treated for it empirically at the\\ntime of his presentation.\\nThe diagnosis of colonic ischemia is consistent with\\nthis patient\\'s course and CT findings. Could an embo-\\nlus to the superior mesenteric artery have occurred?\\nHe had an isolated episode of paroxysmal atrial fibril-\\nlation of unknown cause. Both ganciclovir and foscar-\\nnet do infrequently cause arrhythmias, but there is no\\ndocumentation of a cardiac abnormality and the pa-\\ntient was in sinus rhythm on admission. There is no\\nevidence of endocarditis. No mesenteric-artery occlu-\\nsion was demonstrated on the CT scans. Ischemic\\ncolitis due to nonocclusive small-vessel disease is un-\\nlikely in this young patient in the absence of a predis-\\nposing condition such as diabetes, and if present it\\nshould have occurred in the watershed region between\\nthe splenic flexure and the sigmoid colon. However, an\\nacute ischemic colitis due to cytomegalovirus vasculi-\\ntis has been reported in patients with AIDS as well as\\nin transplant recipients and is, I believe, the most like-\\nly explanation of this patient\\'s illness. 23,24\\nA diagnosis of cytomegalovirus colitis had been\\nmade eight months before the recent admission. The\\npresenting manifestation of fatigue in the absence of\\ndiarrhea would be unusual, although in one large se-\\nries diarrhea was present only intermittently in 30 per-\\ncent of the cases. 25 We are not told how the diagnosis\\nof cytomegalovirus infection was established. Because\\ncytomegalovirus may be merely a commensal organ-\\nism, histologic evidence of invasion is generally re-\\nquired, as shown by typical cytomegalovirus inclusion\\nbodies found on biopsy. However, although the diag-\\nnosis of cytomegalovirus colitis in this case is uncer-\\ntain, the improvement after the institution of ganciclo-\\nvir supports it.\\nThe patient\\'s fatigue recurred two months before\\nthe recent admission, accompanied by acute respirato-\\nry tract symptoms. The findings on bronchoalveolar\\nlavage were consistent with cytomegalovirus infection;\\nin addition, culture revealed resistance to ganciclovir,\\nand therapy was changed to foscarnet. The diagnosis\\nof cytomegalovirus pneumonitis without a biopsy is\\neven more precarious than that of colitis. Cytomeg-\\nalovirus can often be isolated from bronchoalveolar\\nwashings in patients with AIDS, but its pathogenic\\nrole is considered infrequent. Other pathogens, most\\nnotably P. carinii, are often isolated concurrently, and\\nthe outcome appears the same whether or not specific\\ntherapy for cytomegalovirus is given. However, no\\nother pathogens were identified in this case. A CT\\nscan revealed an enlarged left adrenal gland, a finding\\nconsistent with cytomegalovirus adrenalitis, and there\\nwas considerable symptomatic improvement after fos-\\ncarnet administration, further supporting the diagno-\\nsis of cytomegalovirus infection.\\nThere is no mention of side effects after discontinua-\\ntion of foscarnet, and the patient apparently contin-\\nued to feel well. However, unlike the situation with\\ncytomegalovirus retinitis, for which there is strong evi-\\ndence supporting lifelong maintenance therapy, the\\noptimal duration of therapy for both cytomegalovi-\\nrus colitis and cytomegalovirus pneumonitis is un-\\nknown. Foscarnet has substantial toxic effects, includ-\\ning renal failure, seizures, and sudden hypocalcemia,\\nrequiring frequent monitoring, and must be given\\nthrough a central indwelling line, with the possibility\\nof infection. The risk of continued therapy was prob-\\nably judged to outweigh any possible benefit in this\\ncase. However, cessation of the foscarnet therapy\\nmay have led to recrudescence of an indolent cyto-\\nmegalovirus colitis that had been present since the\\ndiagnosis eight months earlier. Foscarnet is virustatic\\nrather than virucidal, and a rebound effect may have\\noccurred.\\nCytomegalovirus is a common opportunistic patho-\\ngen in late-stage AIDS. A recent prospective study\\nidentified cytomegalovirus disease in nearly 10 per-\\ncent of more than 1000 patients, and the estimated\\ntwo-year probability of cytomegalovirus infection in\\npatients with AIDS at entry was greater than 20\\npercent. 26 Although cytomegalovirus retinitis account-\\ned for over 90 percent of the cases of cytomegalovi-\\nrus infection in that series, colitis was the second\\nmost common focus.\\nThe natural history of cytomegalovirus colitis var-\\nies. Untreated, it usually has an indolent, progressive\\ncourse characterized by diarrhea and weight loss, al-\\nthough occasionally there is spontaneous remission of\\nthe symptoms and histologic abnormalities. The ad-\\nministration of specific antiviral therapy results in\\nclinical and histologic evidence of improvement in\\nmost of the cases. 27-29 However, relapse is common\\nwhen therapy is stopped and may occur even with\\ncontinued treatment.\\nCytomegalovirus colitis is the most common cause\\nof both acute lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage and\\nbowel perforation, as well as emergency surgical inter-\\nvention, in patients with AIDS. 2,30-36 The ileum and\\ncecum are the most common sites of hemorrhage or\\nperforation due to cytomegalovirus infection. When\\neither complication has occurred, CT scanning has\\ndemonstrated marked thickening of the involved bow-\\nel and pericolic and mesenteric inflammation, as were\\nseen in this patient. 37-39 In some cases toxic megacolon\\ndevelops. The underlying mechanism in such cases is\\nthought to be direct invasion of small vessels by the\\nvirus, with thrombosis and vasculitis leading to ische-\\nmia and infarction.40\\nThe abrupt onset of this patient\\'s illness after lifting\\na heavy object is unusual and may have been merely\\ncoincidental. However, a transient increase in abdom-\\ninal pressure resulting from strain could have rup-\\ntured a cytomegalovirus ulcer. Such minor exertion\\nprecipitating an acute abdominal event is mentioned\\nin a classic description of the acute abdomen by\\nCope. Hemorrhage from this ulcer might have led to\\nfurther devitalization of tissue, accelerating an al-\\nready emerging cytomegalovirus colitis and leading to\\nbowel ischemia and necrosis and peritonitis. However,\\nit is unlikely that the entire illness was initiated by this\\nevent.\\nCytomegalovirus infection is believed to be a sys-\\ntemic disease and could account for the adrenal en-\\nlargement and pulmonary symptoms documented ear-\\nlier. It can also cause mild chronic pancreatitis and\\nthus may have been responsible for the pancreatic en-\\nlargement and the minimal stranding noted on the CT\\nscans. Although acute pancreatitis should always be\\nconsidered in patients with AIDS presenting with\\nacute abdominal pain, it is unlikely to have contribut-\\ned to this patient\\'s acute illness in view of the absence\\nof severe vomiting, the normal amylase level, and the\\nremote exposure (if any) to didanosine, a common\\nprecipitant of pancreatitis in this population. The\\ntransient episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, al-\\nthough probably drug-related, could indicate cyto-\\nmegalovirus myocarditis.\\nIt is possible that lesions of Kaposi\\'s sarcoma were\\nalso present in the colon in this case. However, hemor-\\nrhage is far less common than in cytomegalovirus in-\\nfection, and when it occurs it is usually from a large,\\nfriable mass, which was not seen on the CT scans. In\\none reported case of colonic perforation in which le-\\nsions of both cytomegalovirus infection and Kaposi\\'s\\nsarcoma were present, the investigators concluded on\\nthe basis of histologic examination that cytomegalovi-\\nrus infection and not Kaposi\\'s sarcoma had led to the\\nperforation. 42 It would also be improbable for such a\\nlesion to cause diffuse ischemia unless it eroded into a\\nmajor vessel.\\nI believe that the procedure performed was an\\nemergency celiotomy, with findings of peritonitis and\\nbowel infarction due to ischemic cytomegalovirus coli-\\ntis. Lesions of Kaposi\\'s sarcoma or evidence of other\\nintestinal pathogens may have been present but did\\nnot contribute directly to the patient\\'s illness.\\nDR. ROBERT E. SCULLY: Dr. Boswell, will you give\\nus the clinical impression?\\nDR. STEPHEN L. BOSWELL: Our clinical impression\\nat the time was cytomegalovirus colitis with ischemic\\ninvolvement of the colon.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nAcute ischemic colitis, with possible perforation,\\ndue to cytomegalovirus.\\nDR. DEBORAH J. COTTON\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nIschemic colitis due to cytomegalovirus vasculitis,\\nwith bowel infarction and peritonitis.\\n? Kaposi\\'s sarcoma of colon.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. SIGRID REGAUER: An emergency laparotomy\\nwas performed, followed by a subtotal ileocolectomy\\nand removal of a segment of jejunum. The larger\\nspecimen was a 100-cm segment of colon with a 3-cm\\nsegment of terminal ileum. The serosa, predominantly\\nof the ascending colon and cecum, had multiple red,\\nfibrinous adhesions and a fibrinopurulent exudate. No\\nfree perforation was identified. The mucosa was dif-\\nfusely hemorrhagic, with prominent, edematous folds,\\nparticularly in the cecum and ascending colon; the\\nbowel wall was greatly thickened (Fig. 2). Histolog-\\nic examination revealed focal transmural necrosis,\\nhemorrhage, and an acute inflammatory infiltrate in\\nthe ascending colon and the cecum, with bacteria in\\nthe necrotic debris. The most striking feature was the\\npresence of prominent eosinophilic nuclear and baso-\\nphilic cytoplasmic inclusions in swollen endothelial\\ncells of numerous capillaries and venules and also in\\nlarge vessels throughout the wall of the cecum and\\nascending colon (Fig. 3). Many affected vessels con-\\ntained fibrin thrombi and had necrotic walls. Immu-\\nnoperoxidase staining for cytomegalovirus was posi-\\ntive in almost every endothelial cell (Fig. 4).\\nThe segment of jejunum, 24 cm long, also had sero-\\nsal fibrinous adhesions. Examination of the mucosa\\nrevealed two ulcerated red plaques, 1.8 and 2.3 cm\\n(Fig. 5). Microscopical examination disclosed mural\\ninfiltration by a proliferation of spindle cells contain-\\ning prominent slit-like vascular spaces filled with\\nerythrocytes, diagnostic of Kaposi\\'s sarcoma (Fig. 6).\\nThe cytomegalovirus inclusions were identified in the\\nendothelial cells within the sarcoma (Fig. 7).\\nThe probable mechanism of cytomegalovirus colitis\\nis a virus-induced vasculitis leading to thrombosis and\\nfocal ischemia. 24,43 Before the AIDS epidemic the ce-\\ncum was most commonly infected by cytomegalovi-\\nrus. 44-46 In patients with AIDS, however, other areas\\nof the large intestine are often involved. The trans-\\nverse colon and less often the descending colon tend to\\nbe spared in cases of localized cytomegalovirus coli-\\ntis. 25 Severe cytomegalovirus colitis with perforation\\noccurs most often between the distal ileum and the\\nsplenic flexure. 32\\nDR. TIMOTHY F. BREWER: All the cultures were neg-\\native throughout the patient\\'s hospital course.\\nDR. BOSWELL: The patient recovered and was dis-\\ncharged on a regimen of foscarnet therapy.

       " '88THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINEImages in Clinical MedicineKIM EAGLE, M.D., EDITORWallerian Degeneration of the Pyramidal TractJuly 14, 1994Coronal views of the brain of a 41-year-old man with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and right-sided spastic hemiplegia,aphasia, and hemianopia were obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) eight months after the patient had an intracerebralhemorrhage. The consecutive T2-weighted coronal MRI slices show the old hematoma as an irregular lesion, which is hypointensebecause of hemosiderin deposition; dilatation of the left lateral ventricle is also evident. In addition, a long band of increased signalintensity traces the anatomical course of the pyramidal tract from the lesion in the internal capsule (left panel, solid arrow) down to the leftcerebral peduncle (open arrow), reaching the pons (arrowhead) and the medulla oblongata (right panel, curved arrow). Wallerian degeneration is the descending destruction of axons and myelinsheaths resulting from neuronal damage, such as that due to ischemic infarction or hemorrhage. The degeneration leads to an increasein extracellular water, producing increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI scans.JOHAN A. DOL, M.D.ELISABETH S.

       " 'A 19-year-old man was admitted to the hospital on New Year\\'s Day because of ascending paresthesias, progressive weakness of the legs, and a rash.\\nHe had been well until 10 days earlier, when a sore throat, productive cough, sweats, fever with a rise in the temperature to 39.4°C, and dizziness developed. A physician found pharyngeal injection with question- able tonsillar exudates, and amoxicillin was pre- scribed. A rapid test for group A streptococcal antigen was negative. Five days before admission, the patient felt better, discontinued the amoxicillin, and returned to work. Three days later he began to have dysesthe- sias in the lower extremities that soon ascended to the level of the chest; he stumbled on walking and ob- served an erythematous, nonpruritic rash over his arms and abdomen that promptly spread to his face and legs. He saw another physician, who prescribed an antihistamine. One day before admission he arose from a chair to go to the toilet but fell because of increasing leg weakness and was unable to void. That evening he was seen at another hospital, where phys- ical examination showed weakness of the legs; he was transferred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was unmarried and worked in a clerical position. He had smoked half a pack of cigarettes dai- ly for two years. He resided on Cape Cod in a wooded area and had a dog that played outdoors; he was un- aware of any tick bites, arthralgia, or localized rash. There was no history of trauma, recent immuniza- tions, previous transient neurologic deficits, thoracic or abdominal pain, or risk factors for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\\nThe temperature was 37.9°C, the pulse was 75, and the respirations were 16. The blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg.\\nOn examination the patient was apprehensive but appeared well. Faint pink macules were present over the posterior aspects of the legs and dorsum of the feet, and they blanched completely with pressure; no vesicles or pustules were seen. No lymphadenopathy was found. The oropharynx was injected, without exu- dates. The neck was supple. Lhermitte\\'s sign was present. The lungs and heart were normal. The abdo- men was normal except that an enlarged bladder was palpated. The extremities appeared normal. Rectal examination was negative except for a decrease in sphincter tone and in the anal wink; a stool specimen was negative for occult blood.\\nOn neurologic examination the patient was alert and oriented, with intact speech and intellectual func- tion. Cranial-nerve functions were preserved. Motor power was 5/5 in the upper extremities, without drift; the left leg was completely paralyzed, including the hip flexors; in the right leg strength was 1/5 in the hip adductors, quadriceps, hamstrings, and iliopsoas and was 3/5 in the dorsiflexors and plantar flexors of the foot; tone was reduced in both legs. Sensation was normal in the upper extremities; there was marked dysesthesia below the level of T3 to T4, with sacral sparing, on testing of pinprick and temperature sensa- tion; vibratory sensation was 50 percent of normal below that level, and the sense of joint position was markedly impaired and present only for large move- ment of the toes. Coordination was preserved in the upper extremities. The deep tendon reflexes were +++ in the upper extremities, absent at the knees, and + at the ankles; bilateral Babinski signs were not- ed; no Hoffmann sign or jaw jerk was found.\\nThe results of hematologic and blood chemical test- ing and of a lumbar puncture are presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3. The levels of urea nitrogen, creatinine, protein (albumin and globulin), bilirubin, calcium, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, amylase, alkaline phosphatase, and uric acid were normal. A test of the serum for drugs of abuse was negative. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110 and was within normal limits in other respects. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical and thoracic spine (Fig. 1 and 2) revealed a diffuse area of bright T₂-weighted signal within the cord that extended from the level of the superior aspect of the C2 vertebral body to the level of T1, with less homoge- neous changes within the upper-to-mid-thoracic cord. Axial T-weighted images revealed extension of the white-matter abnormality into the dorsal-root entry zones; the midportion of the cervical cord was expand- ed. No enhancement was observed after the adminis- tration of gadolinium; magnetic resonance artifacts around the cord and in the epidural space suggested the presence of abnormal vessels. A spinal angio- graphic examination was negative, and a radiograph of the chest was normal.\\nAn indwelling catheter was inserted into the blad- der, and 600 ml of urine was drained. Specimens of blood were obtained for culture and other studies. Heparin was injected subcutaneously, and cimetidine was given by mouth; methylprednisolone (1000 mg) was injected intravenously daily for three days. The temperature rose to 37.6°C on the second hospital day and did not exceed 37.3°C on the third day. Repeated physical examinations showed questionable improve- ment in strength in the legs. The rash quickly faded. All blood-culture specimens remained sterile. A test for HIV antibodies was negative. The cerebrospinal fluid IgG concentration was 10.2 mg per deciliter (normal range, 0 to 8.6), and the albumin concentra- tion was 45.3 mg per deciliter (normal range, 11 to 48). Serum IgM and IgA titers were positive for Lyme disease, but the serum IgG titer and the cerebrospinal fluid IgM, IgG, and IgA titers were negative. Pending receipt of these results, ceftriaxone (1 g given intrave- nously twice daily) was begun.\\nA diagnostic report was received.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. ERIC L. LOGIGIAN*: In summary, this previous- ly healthy young Cape Cod resident presented in the winter with progressive leg weakness, ascending sen- sory loss, urinary retention, and a generalized macular skin rash about one week after an upper respiratory tract infection that was treated with amoxicillin.\\nIn an attempt to illustrate the diagnostic process I shall analyze the data sequentially in the order in which they were collected, beginning with the history, then considering the physical examination, and finally addressing the laboratory data. Each of these tools will be brought to bear on a list of hypothetical diag- noses to try to arrive at the correct one. Through di- rected questions and focused examination, two kinds of diagnosis - anatomical and etiologic are sought in parallel; the first refers to the location of the lesion, and the second to its specific cause. In neurology it is sometimes said that the examination provides the lo- calization, whereas the history yields the cause. In fact, a careful history taking often solves both parts of the diagnostic puzzle, and occasionally, so does the physical examination. In my experience, however, laboratory data infrequently supply an answer not predicted by the history or examination.¹\\nThe history of ascending sensory loss, bladder dis- turbance, and progressive leg weakness sparing the arms, face, and higher cortical function suggests at least four anatomical diagnoses. In descending order of likelihood, they are an expanding spinal cord lesion such as acute transverse myelopathy, a rapidly evolv- ing polyradiculoneuropathy such as a segmental form of the Guillain-Barré syndrome, a combination of the two with both spinal cord and nerve involvement as in Lyme myeloradiculoneuropathy, and an enlarging parasagittal cerebral lesion.\\nThe history provides several clues to the cause. First, the neurologic syndrome began shortly after an upper respiratory tract infection, suggesting that the two processes were related. Second, the tempo of the illness was not catastrophic, as in a sudden ischemic event; instead, there was an interval of two to three days from the onset of neurologic symptoms to the nadir of neurologic function. Third, the patient lived in an area where Lyme disease is endemic, suggesting Lyme neuroborreliosis as a diagnosis. However, the onset of the symptoms was in winter, an unlikely time to be bitten by a tick. The skin rash was a symmetric lesion and was not typical of erythema chronicum mi- grans, which usually begins focally and expands to a large size, accompanied by discrete satellite skin le- sions in half the cases. There were no symptoms of oligoarticular arthritis or cranial neuropathy, which are other characteristic features of Lyme disease. Some patients with Lyme disease have no rash and present only with symptoms resembling those of influ- enza, but this patient\\'s productive cough would be unusual for Lyme disease.³\\nBefore examining the patient, I would have sought other clues to an underlying autoimmune disease process, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or multiple sclerosis, which could be associated with im- munologic injury to neural structures. A history of penicillin allergy would also have been important in- formation, since the neurologic symptoms developed after amoxicillin therapy. To help identify the upper respiratory tract illness, information about childhood discases or immunizations, specifically with respect to measles and rubella, might have been helpful. We do not have this information, but the absence of risk factors for HIV infection and recent immunizations is important, since myelopathy and neuropathy are known consequences of HIV infection and vacci- nation.\\nThe physical examination helped to determine the cause of the original upper respiratory tract infection and to localize the disease in the nervous system. There was unfortunately little information from the examination to make a medical diagnosis of the respi- ratory tract illness. The throat was simply injected, as in pharyngitis. In the absence of signs of pneumonia the patient\\'s productive cough may have been due to a tracheobronchitis accompanying the pharyngitis. There were no important distinguishing features, such as palatal petechiae, which can be seen in an Epstein- Barr viral infection. The rash was nonspecific and could have been due to a reaction to amoxicillin, ex- cept that it was observed days after the amoxicillin had been discontinued. It was not typical of erythe- ma migrans, measles, or rubella. In patients with Epstein-Barr viral infection a characteristic copper- colored rash develops during treatment with ampicil- lint or amoxicillin\\'; the latter antibiotic was prescribed for this patient, but the rash was not described as copper-colored. The absence of vesicles or pustules is evidence against a herpetic viral infection. There was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, which can be seen with a number of infections, such as Epstein-Barr viral infection, cytomegalovirus infec- tion, rubella, and hepatitis. There was no myringitis, which can be found in Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Finally, there was no evidence of oligoarticular arthri- tis, which often occurs in Lyme disease, and there were no signs of other systemic diseases.\\nThe neurologic examination, however, was virtually unequivocal with respect to localization of the disease. The presence of a Lhermitte\\'s sign, plantar extensor responses, and a thoracic sensory level indicated that the patient had a myelopathy. At the bedside one can- not determine with certainty either the upper or the lower extent of most spinal cord lesions. The upper extent is typically several segments above the level of pinprick and temperature sensation, which in this pa- tient was at T3, but one can only guess at the lower extent of a clinically severe spinal cord lesion. Indeed, the flaccid hyporeflexia in the legs of this patient is entirely consistent with an acute rostral cervical or thoracic myelopathy alone, without spread to the lum- bosacral cord segments or a coexistent lumbosacral radiculopathy, which can be seen, for example, in Lyme myeloradiculopathy. Most of the clinically im- portant spinal cord tracts were involved bilaterally: the pyramidal, spinothalamic, and gracillus tracts in the dorsal columns. This extent of involvement is evi- dence against an ischemic myelopathy as in the anteri- or spinal artery syndrome, which usually spares the dorsal columns. Because sacral spinothalamic laminae course peripherally in the rostral cervical cord, the sacral sparing of pinprick sensation in this patient suggests an intramedullary rather than extramedul- lary lesion. Finally, there was no evidence of disease rostral to the spinal cord, which would have been a clue to a multifocal disorder such as multiple sclerosis or encephalomyelitis.\\nAfter the recognition of the presence of a parainfec- tious cervical or high thoracic myelopathy that was probably intramedullary, the most important test ob- tained was the imaging study of the spine to rule out an extramedullary mass compressing the cervical or upper thoracic spinal cord and to prove that the intra- medullary lesion was not due to a tumor or an arterio- venous malformation. May we review the MRI study?\\nDR. PAMELA W. SCHAEFER: A T₂-weighted sagittal image of the cervical spine (Fig. 1) shows a difluse T₂ hyperintense signal abnormality with cord expansion extending from the level of C2 into the upper thoracic cord. There is no evidence of cord compression or abnormal flow voids. A T₂-weighted axial image (Fig. 2) demonstrates the signal abnormality in the central cord and also its extension into the region of the dor- sal-root entry zones. This abnormality was not en- hanced with gadolinium.\\nDR. LOGIGIAN: Do the angiographic and MRI findings exclude the possibility of an intramedullary tumor?\\nDR. SCHAEFER: A diffuse tumor, such as an astrocy- toma, could have this appearance on an MRI scan and might not be visible on angiographic exami- nation.\\nDR. LOGIGIAN: On the basis of the clinical and MRI findings, I conclude that the patient had acute trans- verse myelopathy, a hypothesis already suggested by the history.\\nA transverse myelopathy begins with paresthesias (usually ascending from the feet), pain (typically in- terscapular), leg weakness (usually bilateral), or a sphincter disturbance. The neurologic deficit typically evolves over days to weeks, smoothly or stepwise, be- fore it plateaus, but it can also progress to a nadir over minutes to hours. The disorder can occur at any age, but most patients are young to middle-aged adults. Symptoms of a preceding infection, usually an upper respiratory tract illness, occur in 30 to 60 percent of the patients. Other medical antecedents include vacci- nation, adenocarcinoma, or a recent surgical proce- dure. Examination typically discloses a fairly symmet- ric thoracic myelopathy, with bilateral involvement of pyramidal, spinothalamic, and dorsal-column func- tion of varying severity, with a sphincter disturbance. Less commonly, the myelopathy is cervical, with or without respiratory embarrassment, or lumbar rather than thoracic, or it presents with dissociated sensory loss with spinothalamic but not dorsal-column dys- function. The findings on cerebrospinal fluid exami- nation can be normal or noteworthy for an elevated protein level, with or without a lymphocytic or poly- morphonuclear pleocytosis. In cases of severe cord swelling with block, xanthochromia and a very high protein level are found. Acute transverse myelopathy is rarely recurrent and is an infrequent harbinger of multiple sclerosis. Recovery of neurologic func- tion may be good, fair, or poor, with pain and a cata- strophic onset, but not cerebrospinal fluid findings, predicting a poor outcome. Not surprisingly, the ba- sis for variable recovery is reflected by the range of neuropathologic abnormalities, from severe necrosis of white and gray matter over many cord segments to predominant demyelination of white matter. The pathogenesis is thought to be autoimmune, especially since lymphocytes from patients with acute transverse myelopathy and multiple sclerosis, but not from those with other spinal cord diseases, can be stimulated by myelin antigens.\" In the setting of concurrent infec- tion, acute transverse myelopathy may also be due in part to active infection of the spinal cord, underscor- ing the need for a prompt exclusion of the possibility of infections for which there is effective therapy.\\nTo determine the cause of acute transverse myelop- athy in this patient, assistance from the laboratory was required, since the medical examination did not point to a specific diagnosis of the upper respiratory tract illness. There were nonspecific abnormalities: anemia, leukocytosis with a left shift, and a moderate elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The cerebro- spinal fluid pleocytosis was predominantly polymor- phonuclear an unusual finding in acute transverse myelopathy 6-9 and a very unusual finding in Lyme neuroborreliosis, in which the pleocytosis is almost always mononuclear. 12-14 The cerebrospinal fluid was also slightly hemorrhagic, but since only the fourth tube was analyzed, the tap might have been traumat- ic. I suspect that the nonhematic cells were only inci- dental arachnoidal cells. The cerebrospinal fluid glu- cose level was less than half the serum glucose level, but it is not known whether it represented a steady- state condition. A slightly low cerebrospinal fluid glu- cose level occurs in acute transverse myelopathy less frequently than an increased protein level, which was also present in this patient. Finally, serum Borrelia burgdorferi IgM and IgA titers were elevated, but the titers and normal range are not given. This informa- tion is important, since titers in the borderline positive range are more likely to be false positive results than are highly positive titers. Although B. burgdorferi anti- body was undetectable in the cerebrospinal fluid, there may still have been intrathecal synthesis of anti- bodies to other antigens, since the cerebrospinal fluid IgG level, but not the albumin level, was elevated.\\nIn general, noninfectious causes of acute transverse myelopathy, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, neurosarcoidosis, a paraneoplastic phenomenon, and anterior-spinal-artery ischemia, are unlikely in this patient in view of the preceding upper respiratory tract illness and the absence of clinical and laboratory findings indicative of these diseases. He had a skin rash consistent with a reaction to amoxicil- lin; although myelitis is a rare complication of the intramuscular administration of penicillin, 15 it has not been reported in patients receiving amoxicillin.\\nIn most cases parainfectious acute transverse mye- lopathy is assumed to be of viral origin. Investigators from this hospital, 16 reviewing the literature up to 1986, found reports of 24 viruses that were associated with acute transverse myelopathy, many of which are also known causes of upper respiratory tract illness. Some of those listed, such as herpes simplex virus type 2 and herpes zoster, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV,¹\" and cytomegalovirus, as well as measles and rubella, are unlikely for reasons that I already gave. I cannot rule out other viruses (for example, influenza or enterovi- ruses such as echovirus), but there were some \"soft\" laboratory clues to a nonviral cause - namely, leuko- cytosis with a left shift, an elevated erythrocyte sedi- mentation rate, and a cerebrospinal fluid profile with a neutrophilic pleocytosis and possibly a low glucose content. The patient was treated initially with amoxi- cillin for presumptive streptococcal pharyngitis until the report of the negative streptococcal antigen test. Since antigen tests may be more specific than sensi- tive, the diagnosis of streptococcal myelitis should re- main a possibility in this case, especially since the pharyngitis may have improved after the treatment with amoxicillin. However, I could find no report of acute transverse myelopathy as either an acute or a delayed manifestation of Streptococcus pyogenes infec- tion. Since this patient smoked, another amoxicillin- responsive bacterial infection to be considered is Haemophilus influenzae infection, a common cause of respiratory tract illness in smokers, but again, this bacterium does not to my knowledge cause acute transverse myelopathy. In rare cases bacterial menin- gitis, sometimes due to H. influenzae, produces a mye- lopathy, 18 but meningeal symptoms never developed in this patient.\\nA century ago the diagnosis of spinal syphilis would have been considered in this case, but spinal syphilis was rare even in earlier times, accounting for only 1.5 percent of the series of over 2000 cases of neurosyphi- lis described by Merritt et al., 19 and the serologic test of the cerebrospinal fluid for syphilis was negative. Another spirochetal disease, leptospirosis, can also cause myelitis, but this disease is associated with prominent hepatic and renal abnormalities, which were not present in this patient. The common contem- porary spirochetal disease is Lyme borreliosis, and it should clearly be considered, since the patient was from an area where this disease is endemic and had an clevated serum antibody titer to B. burgdorferi. Hence, he was treated with intravenously administered ceftri- axone. However, Lyme disease was an unlikely cause of acute transverse myelopathy in this patient, in view of the season when he presented; the absence of any typical dermatologic, rheumatologic, or neurologic sign of Lyme disease; the presence of a produc- tive cough; the polymorphonuclear cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis; and the absence of a detectable concen- tration of B. burgdorferi antibody in the cerebrospinal fluid. These data do not rule out Lyme disease but do make it less likely than other diagnoses.\\nMyelitis is a well known neurologic manifestation of Lyme disease and has been described in both the acute 2,14 and the chronic 20,21 stages of the infection. In most patients Lyme myelitis is accompanied by a painful radiculoneuropathy or cranial neuropathy or encephalitis; only rarely is it found in isolation. 22,23 Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid almost always shows a lymphocytic meningitis with a detectable con- centration of B. burgdorferi antibody, but there are rare cases with a polymorphonuclear pleocytosis 24,25 or a low cerebrospinal fluid glucose level. 12 Lyme neuro- borreliosis can even present in the winter26 but only if exposure to a tick was many weeks earlier, in the warmer weather, when erythema migrans usually de- velops. Hence, if acute transverse myelopathy was due to Lyme disease in this case, exposure to a tick had to have occurred much earlier, and the preceding win- tertime upper respiratory tract illness, which was not likely to have been a delayed manifestation of Lyme disease, had to be a coincidental, unrelated second illness. Since an upper respiratory tract illness often precedes acute transverse myelopathy, however, I do not believe that it was coincidental in this case; I think that the upper respiratory tract illness was causative and not itself due to Lyme disease.\\nOne of two possibilities seems likely to explain the elevated serum IgA and IgM antibody titers to B. burgdorferi. They may have been false positive titers, since the values are often borderline or slightly high, usually in the setting of another infectious or connec- tive-tissue disease. 27 In such cases Western blotting shows only a restricted number of bands, 28 as com- pared with the larger number typically seen in serum from patients with Lyme disease. The alternative ex- planation is that the patient was in the 3 to 10 percent of the endemic population who are asymptomatic but have been exposed to the organism.29 Thus, an \"ele- vated\" serum titer to B. burgdorferi does not prove ex- posure to the organism, and even if the titer is truly positive, it does not establish the presence of active infection with B. burgdorferi.\\nIn recent years the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been employed to detect B. burgdorferi gene segments in various samples, including cerebrospinal fluid.30 Although this is a powerful technique, it re- mains to be seen how useful it will be in practice, since preliminary data indicate that analysis of the cerebro- spinal fluid with PCR is nowhere near 100 percent sensitive, even in patients with neuroborreliosis with inflammatory changes in the cerebrospinal fluid.31 In the absence of a scrupulous laboratory technique, a false positive result can occur because of contamina- tion of negative samples with exogenous B. burgdorferi. In short, the diagnosis of Lyme disease is based on clinical findings with confirmatory laboratory tests, and not the reverse. In this case I cannot escape the undertow of clinical data drawing me away from this diagnosis.\\nAt least one other nonviral cause of parainfectious acute transverse myelopathy merits consideration in this case namely, M. pneumoniae. This organism is a very common cause of upper respiratory tract ill- ness in young adults and often presents with pharyngi- tis or tracheobronchitis, skin rash, leukocytosis with a left shift, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimenta- tion rate, 32 as in this patient. It is associated with a wide variety of neurologic manifestations affecting the neuraxis from the cerebral cortex to the peripheral nerve.33 Indeed, more than 10 serologically proved cases of mycoplasma myelitis have been reported in the literature since 1973.34-42 Although examination of the cerebrospinal fluid generally shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis, in at least three of the cases there was a polymorphonuclear pleocytosis, 35,10,41 as in this case. Mycoplasma infection is an important diagnosis to consider, since it responds better to erythromycin or tetracycline than to penicillin or cephalosporin.\\nWhat, then, was the diagnostic laboratory report in this case? There are several possibilities. If cerebrospi- nal fluid was sent for a PCR test for B. burgdorferi, I expect to learn that it was negative and shall be skepti- cal if it was considered positive, unless that result was confirmed in more than one laboratory. Measurement of titers or PCR testing for various viruses may have been ordered during the acute phase of the illness, and I would not be astounded if the results were positive for one of the several viruses associated with acute transverse myelopathy. However, my diagnosis is M. pneumoniae infection, and I suspect that the diag- nostic report was a high titer or a positive rapid anti- gen test for this organism.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nTransverse myelitis due to Lyme disease or Myco- plasma pneumoniae infection.\\nDR. ERIC L. LOGIGIAN\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nMycoplasma pneumoniae infection.\\nAcute transverse myelopathy.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDr. Megan B. MURRAY: The initial test for Lyme disease was a screening enzyme-linked immunosor- bent assay (ELISA) for IgG and IgM that was posi- tive at 153 ELISA units. The next tests were antibody- capture enzyme immunoassays that differentiate the immunoglobulin subclasses. They demonstrated an IgM of 4.2, an IgA of 3.3, and an IgG of less than 1 (normal values, less than 1), findings that might have been consistent with very early infection with B. burgdorferi; during the convalescent phase, the IgM value was 1.5; IgA and IgG levels were not detectable.\\nSerologic diagnosis by ELISA can be insensitive and nonspecific, since antibodies to a variety of organ- isms, including Treponema pallidum and Epstein-Barr virus, have been found to cross-react with the Lyme antigen. When the ELISA and capture enzyme im- munoassays are positive, we attempt to confirm the diagnosis by immunoblotting or Western blotting, which allows a much more detailed profile of antibody responses to multiple antigens of B. burgdorferi. The requirement of three positive IgM bands or five posi- tive IgG bands can increase the specificity of the sero- diagnosis to 95 percent. The immunoblotting for this patient included only two positive IgG bands on test- ing of serum samples obtained during both the acute and convalescent phases of illness.\\nIn this case, however, intrathecal production of antibody to Lyme disease could not be demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid by the same technique of immunoblotting, in contrast to the typical intrathecal antibody response seen in acute meningitis associated with Lyme disease. In a recent study coauthored by Dr. Logigian, 43 92 percent of American patients with Lyme meningitis had intrathecal antibody, with the ratio of the cerebrospinal fluid concentration to the serum concentration ranging from 2 to 4, depending on the antibody subclass. Several researchers have used PCR to detect B. burgdorferi in cerebrospinal fluid from patients known to have neuroborreliosis, with varying rates of success; data on the sensitivity and specificity of this assay are not available at present. The PCR tests performed on cerebrospinal fluid and serum from this patient were negative. Additional tests on serum obtained on the fourth hospital day and at a follow-up visit six weeks later provided the correct diagnosis. The serum was tested for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, rubella, measles, mumps, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, influ- enza A and B, parainfluenza, and varicella viruses, and mycoplasma antibodies. All the tests were nega- tive except the test for mycoplasma; the complement- fixation titer was 4096 in the first sample and 512 in the second.\\nThe serologic diagnosis of mycoplasma infection re- quires a fourfold increase in antibody in paired serum samples or a titer of higher than 64 in a single sample. Since neurologic syndromes associated with myco- plasma infection often present several weeks after the initial upper respiratory tract syndrome, it is not un- usual to see a titer that is higher during the acute phase than during the convalescent phase. Standard serologic tests for mycoplasma are based on comple- ment-fixation assays that use lipid extracts of the or- ganism as the antigen. These tests are also nonspecific, since antibody to mycoplasma cross-reacts with anti- gen found in streptococci and chloroplasts, to the ex- tent that glycolipid extracts of spinach can be used for the serologic diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection. Although Western blotting for mycoplasma is not a routine diagnostic test, Dr. George E. Kenny (Univer- sity of Washington, Seattle) tested serum samples ob- tained during both the acute and convalescent phases of illness and found antibodies to the major polypep- tides of M. pneumoniae but not to those of M. genitalium. These antibodies were better resolved with antiserum against IgG than with antiserum against IgM. Myco- plasma can cause multiple infections in a single host over time, and high IgM titers are found more often in young children than in adults, who are probably expe- riencing repeated infection. High intrathecal antibody titers against mycoplasma have not been demonstrat- ed in the presence of an intact blood-brain barrier. In this case we also attempted to culture mycoplasma from a cerebrospinal fluid sample that had been frozen at -40°C, but after eight weeks we have observed no growth. There have been only a few reported cases in which mycoplasma was successfully cultured from cerebrospinal fluid15-47; in several of these cases inno- vative isolation techniques that are not in standard use were employed.\\nThere are two possible explanations for the false positive Lyme ELISA in the patient under discussion. The first is that nonspecific antibodies to mycoplasma cross-react with Lyme antigen, although I have been unable to find other case reports of this association in the literature. The second explanation is that this patient had previously been exposed to Lyme disease and that mycoplasma infection induced an anam- nestic increase in Lyme antibody. Indeed, myco- plasma has been shown to be a polyclonal stimulator of B cells in mouse lymphocytes, and the antibody produced by these mitogenically activated cells has often been of the IgM subclass. In at least one other reported case of mycoplasma-associated neurologic disease, the authors noted an increase in Epstein- Barr virus titers that was inconsistent with the in- crease in antibody to mycoplasma.49 In this case a diagnosis of mycoplasma infection was confirmed by culture of the organism from the cerebrospinal fluid, making it very unlikely that the increase in the Epstein-Barr virus titers reflected a primary infec- tious mononucleosis.\\nDR. RAYMOND D. ADAMS: Do you know of any de- tailed neuropathological reports on cases of myco- plasma infection? The skin rash and the cord lesion with central nervous system involvement are very reminiscent of the postinfectious type of myelitis, rais- ing the question of whether there is some other viral agent or some peculiarity of the mycoplasma itself that can produce this lesion. In a few of the postmor- tem studies the lesions have been of a perivenous de- myelinative type.\\nDR. MURRAY: I think that the cases of transverse myelitis in these studies are mixed with cases of me- ningoencephalitis, and it is not clear from them wheth- er the pathological pattern is actually distinct.\\nDR. LOGIGIAN: This case illustrates the potential pitfalls in the diagnosis of Lyme disease with serologic tests in the absence of typical clinical findings. In this case it was potentially very important to make the diagnosis of mycoplasma infection, because the two infections respond to different antibiotics.\\nADDENDUM\\nDR. GUY A. RoRDORF: I saw the patient for a fol- low-up examination approximately three months after the diagnostic report. He could walk and run, had no sensory symptoms, and had regained full control of his bowel and bladder function. His neurologic examina- tion was noteworthy only for mild spasticity of the lower extremities, with increased tone, hyperreflexia, and a bilateral plantar extensor response.',\n",

MCNEELY, Assistant Editor\\nCASE 3-1995\\nPRESENTATION OF CASE\\nA 29-year-old man was admitted to the hospital be-\\ncause of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome\\n(AIDS) and multiple splenic abscesses.\\nThe patient was homosexual and had been found to\\nhave AIDS two and a half years earlier; at that time the\\nCD4 cell count was 173 per cubic millimeter. He had a\\npositive serologic test for cytomegalovirus antibodies\\nand negative serologic tests for syphilis, toxoplasma,\\nand hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody; he was\\nanergic to tuberculin. An episode of Salmonella cholerae-\\nsuis bacteremia occurred 16 months before admission,\\nand the patient was treated for 6 months with ciproflox-\\nacin. He had had positive stool cultures in the past for\\nshigella and campylobacter microorganisms and der-\\nmatomal herpes zoster infection. Pneumococcal vac-\\ncine had been given, and he had received the current\\ninfluenza vaccine.\\nOne year before admission the patient had chronic\\nabdominal discomfort that did not respond to medica-\\ntions; examination with a fiberoptic endoscope showed\\ncandidal esophagitis, and fluconazole was prescribed.\\nSix months before admission left supraclavicular\\nlymphadenopathy developed, with ulceration of the\\ntongue and the alveolar ridge. Culture of a specimen\\nfrom a lymph-node biopsy yielded Histoplasma capsula-\\ntum, and amphotericin B (50 mg daily) was given in-\\ntravenously for a total dose of 2 g. The lymphadenopa-\\nthy and oral ulcers resolved, and itraconazole (200\\nmg twice daily) was given as maintenance treatment.\\nThereafter, the patient began to lose weight. During\\ntwo weeks in jail itraconazole and trimethoprim-sulfa-\\nmethoxazole were discontinued; on his release itraco-\\nnazole was resumed. Three months before admission a\\nlingual ulcer recurred. Zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine),\\nwhich had been given for an indeterminate period, was\\nFigure 1.

On the day of ad-\\nmission physical examination revealed a lingual ulcer\\nand prominent splenomegaly. A lingual biopsy dis-\\nclosed nonspecific changes consistent with aphthous\\nstomatitis; no acid-fast bacilli, fungi, or viral inclusions\\nwere seen. A culture of the specimen grew rare colonies\\nof Staphylococcus aureus. A computed tomographic (CT)\\nscan of the abdomen (Fig. 1 and 2), performed without\\nthe administration of contrast material, revealed\\nmarked splenomegaly (18 cm in length), with multiple\\nlarge, hypodense lesions, some with central hemor-\\nrhage.

His medications at the time of admission\\ncomprised zalcitabine (0.75 mg orally three times dai-\\nly) and itraconazole (200 mg twice daily). There was a\\nhistory of hemolytic anemia that was ascribed to treat-\\nment with dapsone, leukopenia during the administra-\\ntion of zidovudine, and hypersensitivity to trimetho-\\nprim-sulfamethoxazole because of a rash. The patient\\nconsumed alcohol infrequently and did not smoke or in-\\nject illicit drugs.

FISHMAN*: May we review the pertinent\\nradiologic findings?\\nDR. MICHAEL J. LEE: Radiographs of the chest ob-\\ntained on admission appear normal, with clear lung\\nfields. The CT scan of the abdomen (Fig. 1 and 2)\\nshows splenomegaly, with multiple focal lesions. Most\\nof the lesions have low-density centers, a finding consis-\\ntent with necrosis, and a few have high-density centers,\\nsuggesting hemorrhage. Multiple lymph nodes, up to\\n2 cm in diameter, extend from the level of the renal hi-\\nlar areas to the aortic bifurcation. Multiple punctate\\ncalcific densities are visible throughout both kidneys\\nand the liver, which is otherwise normal.\\nDR. FISHMAN: The central feature of this patient's\\npresentation is progressive AIDS, with multiple oppor-\\ntunistic infections. He had multiple large splenic ab-\\nscesses after enduring acute abdominal pain for over a\\nweek and perhaps for as long as one year. He had well-\\ndefined risk factors for additional opportunistic infec-\\ntions or tumors. There is a time line for conditions\\naffecting patients with AIDS (Fig. 3), reflecting the\\nprogressive and cumulative risk of infection both over\\ntime and in relation to the decreasing CD4 lymphocyte\\ncount. The progressive decline in immune function ren-\\nders patients susceptible to all pathogens to which they\\nhave been exposed in the past and may be exposed in\\nthe future. In patients with a CD4 lymphocyte count of\\nless than 200 per cubic millimeter, these pathogens in-\\nclude numerous fungi, bacteria, protozoa, parasites,\\nand viruses.

Time Line for Processes Affecting Persons Infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).\\nBoth opportunistic infections (below the line) and noninfectious processes (above the line) are presented as a function of the declining\\nCD4 lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood over time. Multiple conditions and infections occur in each host; individual susceptibility\\nvaries. The risk of early-stage infections or conditions will persist without specific therapy or prophylaxis. M. tuberculosis infection may\\noccur at any point in the continuum. HIV-2 infection may have a slower progression than HIV-1 infection.\\nmunodeficiency virus (HIV), other viral infections may\\nhave systemic effects (e.g., fever and wasting), act as\\ncofactors in the pathogenesis of malignant tumors and\\nas immunosuppressive agents (especially in cases of in-\\nfection with cytomegalovirus), and serve as a portal for\\nbacterial pathogens. This list must be expanded to in-\\nclude previous exposure to various infections acquired\\nduring travel or occupational exposure.¹ Because of the\\npatient's unemployment and incarceration, the poten-\\ntial role of tuberculosis may have been increased.\\nAmong the many potential pathogens, which ones\\nare likely to cause splenic necrosis or abscess forma-\\ntion? In the immunologically normal host splenic ab-\\nscesses are uncommon and are generally related to\\ntrauma, splenic infarction, hemoglobinopathy (espe-\\ncially sickle cell disease), or bacteremia or are spread\\nfrom an adjacent viscus (Table 3).2,3 In a recent review\\napproximately 70 percent of splenic abscesses devel-\\noped in patients with concurrent infection. Endocardi-\\ntis accounts for up to 15 percent of all abscesses, and\\ninfection of the urinary tract, abdomen, or lungs each\\naccounts for 5 to 8 percent. Intravenous drug abusers\\nare susceptible to the formation of splenic abscesses.5\\nApproximately two thirds of the organisms causing\\nsplenic abscesses are aerobic bacteria, with gram-posi-\\ntive cocci implicated in about 25 percent of the cases,\\nEscherichia coli in about 10 percent, salmonella species\\nin up to 10 percent, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and en-\\nterobacter in about 1 percent each (Fig. 3).2,3,6 Anaero-\\nbic bacteria, especially streptococci, bacteroides, propi-\\nonibacterium, and clostridium species, account for 13\\nto 39 percent. Fungal abscesses are generally seen only\\nin immunocompromised patients. Candida species are\\npresent in up to 10 percent of these patients, most often\\nin association with hepatosplenic candidiasis. Dual in-\\nfections account for 10 to 15 percent of the cases and\\nTable 3.

I have seen splenic infections due to H. cap-\\nsulatum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Propionibacterium,\\nand P. carinii in these patients. They have also reported of\\nabscesses associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma,\\nand bacillary angiomatosis and infections due to\\nM. avium complex, Salmonella, and P. carinii. Splenic abscesses caused by\\ndisseminated fungal infection may be unrecognized in\\npatients with AIDS who have life-threatening systemic\\nillnesses and are undergoing intensive therapy. Splenic\\ninfection in association with AIDS is likely to be due to\\nprogressive susceptibility to organisms that grow in or\\nare cleared by macrophages under the main control\\nT lymphocytes. This group includes the patient of\\nP. carinii, salmonella species, and M. tuberculosis. My col-\\nleagues and I have conducted studies demonstrating\\nthat the synthesis of specific cytokine messenger RNAs\\nand protein by HIV-infected macrophages is abnormal\\nin response to a challenge with P. carinii. The macro-\\nphagocytosis that is caused by HIV infection appears\\nto be specific to the infecting organism. HIV-1 may in-\\nfect alveolar macrophages more readily than other hu-\\nman macrophages, and predispose patients to the disease\\ntherapy is enhanced by concurrent cytomegalovirus in-\\nfection remains controversial. Generally, unless bacte-\\nrial or fungal superinfection or hemorrhage has oc-\\ncurred or splenic rupture is believed to be imminent,\\nsystemic therapy for multiple small abscesses due to\\nP. carinii may avert the need for splenectomy.\\nIn summary, this patient had had abdominal discom-\\nfort without diarrhea for at least a year. Candida esoph-\\nagitis was successfully treated with fluconazole, but the\\nimpression persists that the recent admission was relat-\\ned to that earlier abdominal process and possibly un-\\nrelated to the candida infection. Amphotericin B (2 g\\nintravenously) was appropriately given for disseminat-\\ned histoplasmosis, with itraconazole (400 mg daily) for\\nmaintenance suppression. The lymphadenopathy and\\noral ulcers resolved with this therapy. Weight loss be-\\ngan over four months before admission; the cause was\\nnot clear, but it might have been related to progressive\\nunderlying AIDS, drug toxicity, a tumor, or ongoing in-\\nfection.\\nWhat clues do we have to that diagnosis? Except for\\na two-week hiatus, itraconazole had been administered\\ncontinuously, and that therapy should prevent recur-\\nrent infection with candida, histoplasma, and most of\\nthe fungi other than P. carinii. A serologic test for toxo-\\nplasma was negative. An oral ulcer recurred three\\nmonths before admission. Oral ulcers are common in\\npatients with AIDS (Table 4). They can develop spon-\\ntaneously or can be due to HIV infection, other infec-\\ntions, including histoplasmosis, zalcitabine, or tumors.\\nThe biopsy findings were consistent with aphthous sto-\\nTable 4. Causes of Oral Ulcers in Patients\\nwith AIDS.\\nTYPE OF ULCER\\nCAUSE\\nRecurrent aphthous Autoimmune or idiopathic\\n(solitary or multi-\\nple canker sores)\\nNecrotizing\\nBacterial\\nFungal\\nViral\\nMalignant\\nSuperinfection, stomatitis\\nTuberculosis, bacillary angiomatosis, en-\\nterobacteriaceae\\nCandida, histoplasma, cryptococcus\\nCytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus\\nLymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, squamous-\\ncell carcinoma\\nmatitis, and special stains were unrevealing. In view of\\nthe histopathological features, the isolation of rare\\nStaph. aureus from the biopsy specimen probably reflect-\\ned colonization or contamination. Therapy with an an-\\ntifungal agent may result in negative fungal cultures of\\nthe blood, even in the presence of substantial infection.\\nHowever, bacterial cultures (e.g., for salmonella) may\\nbe positive in patients with multiple splenic abscesses.\\nThree clues suggest a role for P. carinii infection.\\nFirst, the patient had been without prophylaxis for\\nmore than four months. Second, P. carinii was detected\\non examination of induced sputum. Third, the CT-scan\\npattern is typical of that for extrapulmonary P. carinii\\ninfection\\nmultiple large splenic lesions with hemor-\\nrhage and necrosis and calcification in the liver and\\nkidneys.\\nIt is not possible to rule out all the potential causes\\nof this man's splenic disease. Dual infections and met-\\nastatic tumor are common features of AIDS and may\\ninvolve the spleen. The isolation of organisms from one\\nsite (e.g., H. capsulatum or P. carinii) does not make oth-\\ner, simultaneous infections less or more likely elsewhere\\nin this host. For example, the presence of enlarged\\nlymph nodes without caseation might suggest myco-\\nbacterial infection. However, in view of the available\\ndata, disseminated infection due to P. carinii seems the\\nmost likely cause of this patient's disease.\\nHow should the diagnosis have been established? A\\ntissue-based diagnosis would have helped rule out oth-\\ner pathogens or a malignant tumor. Unless the pa-\\ntient's clinical condition (e.g., an impending splenic\\nrupture) or the absence of viable splenic cortex made a\\nsplenectomy necessary, aspiration of abscess material\\nmight have allowed the preservation of some splenic\\nfunction. Multiple small splenic abscesses due to either\\nmycobacterial disease or P. carinii infection generally\\nrespond to adequate systemic therapy. However, in\\nview of the number and size of the abscesses, thrombo-\\ncytopenia, and preexisting hemorrhage into one of\\nthese lesions, adequate drainage probably could not\\nhave been achieved by percutaneous drainage, and\\nsplenectomy was preferable.\\nDR.

       " 'A 39-year-old man was admitted to the hospital be-\\ncause of calcifications around the aortic root, a recent\\nmyocardial infarction, and subsequent congestive heart\\nfailure, with increasing aortic regurgitation.\\nThe patient had been well until six years earlier,\\nwhen progressive renal insufficiency with hypertension\\nwas found. A low-protein diet and enalapril were begun.\\nHe was subsequently well until four months before ad-\\nmission, when chest pain developed and he entered an-\\nother hospital. The urea nitrogen concentration was\\n143 mg per deciliter (51.1 mmol per liter), and the cre-\\natinine concentration was 9.4 mg per deciliter (830\\nµmol per liter). An electrocardiogram showed an acute\\nmyocardial infarct. A transthoracic cardiac ultrasono-\\ngraphic examination revealed a mass around the aortic\\nroot that was suspected to represent an aneurysm of\\nthe sinus of Valsalva. A transesophageal cardiac ultra-\\nsonographic examination at another hospital showed a\\nmultilobulated mass with a highly reflective surface and\\na sonolucent center encircling the anterior aspect of the\\naortic root and right coronary artery. Dense echogenic\\nmaterial extended onto the base of the anterior mitral\\nleaflet. The aortic valve was tricuspid, with mild steno-\\nsis and regurgitation. The peak systolic aortic gradient\\nby continuous-wave Doppler study was 40 mm Hg. The\\nleft ventricular size and ejection fraction were normal;\\nthe inferior segments of the left ventricle appeared\\nslightly hypokinetic. A magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI) scan of the heart also disclosed an extensive\\nmass that involved the aortic root and the myocardial\\nsurface of the right ventricle, without obvious invasion\\nof the ventricle. Serologic tests for brucella and coxiella\\nmicroorganisms were negative. The patient was afe-\\nbrile, and multiple blood-culture specimens were ster-\\nile. It was decided not to perform a surgical procedure.\\nThe urea nitrogen concentration declined to 88 mg per\\ndeciliter (31 mmol per liter), and the creatinine concen-\\ntration to 8.8 mg per deciliter (780 µmol per liter). The\\npatient was discharged, with arrangements made for ex-\\ntracorporeal hemodialysis.\\nThe patient felt well until two weeks before admis-\\nsion, when he began to have bouts of dyspnea, usually\\nafter dialysis. Four days before admission he was treat-\\ned for congestive heart failure at another hospital.\\nThere was evidence of increasing aortic regurgitation.\\nEpisodes of intermittent atrioventricular dissociation,\\nwith a ventricular rate of 40 to 50, were observed, and\\non the fourth hospital day a sequential dual-chamber\\nelectronic pacemaker was implanted. The patient was\\ntransferred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was unmarried and lived alone. He was\\na veterinarian who treated dogs and cats predominant-\\nly. He traveled to England in the summer and frequent-\\nly took cruises to the Caribbean and South America.\\nHis father had died at the age of 41 years of a ruptured\\nintracranial mycotic aneurysm due to bacterial endo-\\ncarditis on a bicuspid aortic valve. There was no family\\nhistory of renal disease. The patient\\'s medications con-\\nsisted of metoprolol, cimetidine, ferrous sulfate, and a\\nmultivitamin preparation. There was no history of\\nrecent dental procedures or chest pain, palpitations,\\nperipheral edema, fever, chills, sweats, weight loss, con-\\nsumption of unpasteurized milk, use of tobacco or alco-\\nhol, intravenous drug abuse, or other risk factors for hu-\\nman immunodeficiency virus infection.\\nThe temperature was 36.6°C, the respirations were\\n18, and the heart rhythm was paced at 80 beats per\\nminute; the blood pressure was 90/50 mm Hg.\\nOn physical examination the patient appeared\\nchronically ill. No lymphadenopathy or cutaneous evi-\\ndence of infection was detected. The carotid pulses\\nwere ++, with a systolic thrill over the left carotid ar-\\ntery. The lungs were clear. A grade 3 harsh systolic\\nejection murmur was present at the right upper sternal\\nborder, with radiation to both carotid arteries; a grade\\n3 long aortic diastolic murmur was present; no S3 was\\nheard. The abdomen was normal. There was no pe-\\nripheral edema, clubbing, or cyanosis. Rectal examina-\\ntion was negative, and a stool specimen was negative\\nfor occult blood. Neurologic examination was negative.\\nThe urine was positive for protein and had a specific\\ngravity of 1.005; the sediment was normal. The pro-\\nthrombin and partial-thromboplastin times were nor-\\nmal. Other hematologic and blood chemical values are\\npresented in Tables 1 and 2. An electrocardiogram\\nshowed that the atrioventricular sequential pacemaker\\nwas functioning normally at a ventricular rate of 81.\\nAn anteroposterior radiograph of the chest, obtained\\nwith portable equipment, revealed a dual-lead elec-\\ntronic pacemaker with electrode tips that were appro-\\npriately situated in the right cardiac chambers. The\\npulmonary vessels were indistinct, and there was perihilar haziness; no pleural effusion was seen. The heart\\nsize was at the upper limit of normal. A specimen of\\narterial blood, drawn while the patient was breathing\\nroom air, showed that the partial pressure of oxygen\\nwas 89 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide\\nwas 29 mm Hg, and the pH was 7.42. A serologic test\\nfor syphilis and a test for antinuclear antibodies were\\nnegative; two blood-culture specimens yielded no mi-\\ncroorganisms.\\nOxygen was administered as needed. Aluminum hy-\\ndroxide gel was added to the patient\\'s customary med-\\nications. He was mostly afebrile, with the temperature\\nno higher than 38°C. The dyspnea improved after hemodialysis had induced the loss of 3 kg of fluid; hemo-\\ndialysis was continued every second day, and epoetin\\n(erythropoietin) treatment was begun. A tuberculin\\nskin test with purified protein derivative (5 TU) and\\nskin tests with candida and mumps antigens were neg-\\native at 48 hours.\\nA transesophageal cardiac ultrasonographic study\\n(Fig. 1) showed moderate-to-severe mitral regurgita-\\ntion. The anterior and posterior mitral annulus was\\ncalcified, and an irregular mobile echodensity, 0.8 cm\\nlong, was attached to the mitral annulus at the base of\\nthe posterior leaflet. The contour and motion of the\\nlatter abnormality were suggestive of a vegetation, but its density was consistent with a chronic lesion. The\\naortic leaflets were restricted in motion, with a peak\\nsystolic gradient of 64 mm Hg, and there was moderate\\naortic insufficiency. Fine echodensities were attached\\nto the tips of the aortic cusps. An echogenic mass\\nanterior to the aortic root was again noted, without\\nDoppler evidence of blood flow within the mass or fis-\\ntulous flow from the mass or aortic root to any adjacent\\ncardiac chamber. The left ventricle was dilated, with\\nan ejection fraction of 74 percent; no segmental left\\nventricular dysfunction was detected. As compared\\nwith the previous echocardiographic studies, the de-\\ngree of aortic and mitral insufficiency was increased,\\nwith concomitant enlargement of the left atrium and\\nventricle. The mass anterior to the aortic root appeared\\nsmaller, but a lesion on the posterior mitral-valve leaf-\\nlet was new.\\nA computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest\\n(Fig. 2), performed without the intravenous adminis-\\ntration of contrast material, revealed mitral valvular\\ncalcifications and dense, irregular calcifications at the\\nroot of the aorta and the pulmonary arteries and con-\\ntinuing into the atrioventricular groove. The ascending\\naortic root was enlarged at 4.5 cm, and small bilateral\\npleural effusions were present. The hilar regions ap-\\npeared normal.\\nThe results of pulmonary-function studies were nor-\\nmal, except that the vital capacity was 4.4 liters (78\\npercent of the predicted value), the flow at 25 percent\\nof total vital capacity was 1.59 liters per second (53\\npercent of the predicted value), and the single-breath\\ndiffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was 18.5 ml per\\nminute per mm Hg (65 percent of the predicted value).\\nThe results of a cardiac-catheterization study are\\npresented in Table 3. A biplane thoracic angiographic study (Fig. 3) showed extensive calcifications in the vi-\\ncinity of the aortic root that deformed the right coro-\\nnary sinus and probably involved the aortic annulus. A\\ncyst-like eggshell calcification extended anteriorly and\\ninferiorly to the aortic valve, remained to the right of\\nthe right ventricular outflow tract, and extended to the\\nregion of the tricuspid annulus and beneath the non-\\ncoronary sinus. Severe aortic regurgitation was noted.\\nA left ventriculographic examination revealed ventricu-\\nlar tachycardia and moderate mitral regurgitation. The\\nejection fraction was 79 percent on a postextrasystolic\\nbeat that disclosed normal regional-wall motion. A cor-\\nonary angiographic examination showed right domi-\\nnance, with minor stenoses. The urea nitrogen concen-\\ntration fell to 26 mg per deciliter (9.3 mmol per liter), and the creatinine concentration to 4.9 mg per deciliter\\n(433 µmol per liter).\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. STEPHEN A. ABRAHAM*: Maybe we review the ra-\\ndiologic and echocardiographic studies?\\nDR. ROBERT E. DINSMORE: The CT scan (Fig. 2)\\nshows dilatation of the ascending aorta to 4.5 cm in di-\\nameter. A calcific mass is evident between the aortic\\nroot and the right ventricular outflow tract, in the area\\nof the aortic-valve annulus and behind the posterior\\natrioventricular groove. An extension to the anterior\\natrioventricular area and inferiorly to the atrioventric-\\nular septum appears. The thoracic aortographic study (Fig. 3) shows severe aortic regurgitation. The\\naortic leaflets are slightly thickened, with reduced mo-\\ntion. The left ventriculographic study demonstrates nor-\\nmal contraction and moderate mitral regurgitation.\\nThe coronary arteriographic examination reveals mul-\\ntiple atherosclerotic plaques, with only mild luminal\\nnarrowing. The right coronary artery is not deformed\\nby the adjacent calcified mass.\\nDR. MARC J. SEMIGRAN: The transesophageal echo-\\ncardiographic study performed four months before ad-\\nmission demonstrates a multilobulated mass with high-\\nly reflective borders encircling the anterior surface of\\nthe aortic root. The tricuspid aortic valve appears mild-\\nly insufficient and stenotic, with a peak systolic gradi-\\nent of 40 mm Hg. Dense echoes extend onto the base\\nof the anterior mitral leaflet. The left ventricular size\\nand ejection fraction are normal, with some hypo-\\nkinesis of the inferior wall.\\nTransesophageal (Fig. 1) and transesophageal echocar-\\ndiograms obtained at this hospital show that the peri-\\naortic mass is somewhat smaller. No fistula is detect-\\nable by color Doppler examination from the aorta or\\nthe mass into any contiguous chambers. The degree of\\naortic stenosis has increased to 64 mm Hg, and the de-\\ngree of aortic insufficiency is moderate. Fine echoes\\nare attached to the free margins of the aortic cusps. A\\nnew irregular mobile mass is attached to the mitral an-\\nnulus at the base of its posterior leaflet, which is con-\\nsistent with a vegetation. Moderate-to-severe mitral in-\\nsufficiency is evident. The left atrium and left ventricle\\nare enlarged. The left ventricular systolic function ap-\\npears normal.\\nDR. ABRAHAM: Aortic insufficiency with a dilated\\naorta and unusual calcification of the aortic root in the\\npresence of a systemic illness raises the possibility of\\nan inflammatory disorder — for example, aortitis.¹ Al-\\nmost all forms of aortitis can affect the aortic valve.\\nAssociated aortic regurgitation may be caused by dila-\\ntation of the aortic-valve ring or valvular involvement\\nwith fibrosis and foreshortening. Syphilitic aortitis\\ncauses myocardial infarction secondary to coronary ostial stenosis. Serologic testing for syphilis was nega-\\ntive in this patient. Giant-cell arteritis generally occurs\\nin older persons. Takayasu\\'s arteritis affects young fe-\\nmales and is usually occlusive but occasionally pre-\\nsents with a dilated ascending aorta. Other diseases as-\\nsociated with aortitis and dilatation or ulceration of an\\naneurysm include the seronegative spondyloarthropa-\\nthies (for example, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing\\nspondylitis, and Reiter\\'s syndrome), relapsing poly-\\nchondritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, and connective-\\ntissue diseases. Of these disorders, however, the only\\nones that might explain concomitant mitral-valve in-\\nvolvement, aortic stenosis, and renal disease are system-\\nic lupus erythematosus. Rheumatic valvulitis could ac-\\ncount for the involvement of both the mitral and the\\naortic valves. In addition, aortitis, arteritis, and glo-\\nmerulonephritis occur with rheumatic fever, and in-\\nflamed coronary arteries may be inflamed and\\noccasionally contain thrombi, causing myocardial in-\\nfarction.² Severe aortic damage is rare, however, oc-\\ncurring only in patients with chronic or recurrent rheu-\\nmatic fever. Also, rheumatic fever causes regurgitation\\nbut not stenosis, and both were present in this patient.\\nAlso, the frequency of arthritis as a presenting mani-\\nfestation of rheumatic fever increases with age, where-\\nas the frequency of carditis decreases with age.² Fi-\\nnally, this patient did not have echocardiographic\\nevidence of rheumatic disease, and poststreptococcal O\\ntiters are not mentioned. He did not have the systolic\\nand diastolic murmurs of an aneurysm of the sinus of\\nValsalva.3,4 That diagnosis would have been made on\\nthe basis of the echocardiographic study. The sonolu-\\ncent center of the mass suggests the possibility of an\\nabscess or mycotic aneurysm, possibly caused by sep-\\ntic embolism from valvular vegetations or contiguous\\nspread of infection through the aorta.5\\nThe patient\\'s myocardial infarction was subsequently\\nshown by angiographic examination to have occurred\\nin the presence of normal coronary arteries and was\\npossibly due to compression of the right coronary ar-\\ntery by the aortic mass, which may have occurred in\\nthe setting of coronary arteritis, systemic lupus erythema-\\ntosus, or a septic embolus complicating infective en-\\ndocarditis.6,7 It is possible that this patient\\'s heart block,\\nrelated to the presence of the aortic mass into the in-\\nterventricular septum, metastatic myocardial calcifica-\\ntion in the presence of severe uremia,8,9 involvement\\nof the conduction system by systemic lupus erythema-\\ntosus,10,11 or a septal abscess complicating infective en-\\ndocarditis without involving the aortic valve.\\nInfective endocarditis without fever or a positive\\nblood culture appears to be the most likely cause of this\\npatient\\'s illness, but before making that diagnosis I\\nmust rule out several other types of endocardial dis-\\nease. Systemic lupus erythematosus can cause dilata-\\ntion of the ascending aorta and valvulitis with mitral or aortic regurgitation or stenosis,12-16 which is occa-\\nsionally severe enough to warrant replacement of the\\nvalve. 17,18 Heart block is uncommon, however, and in\\nthe reported cases the diagnosis of lupus was obvi-\\nous. 10,11 Moreover, verrucous endocarditis rarely causes\\ncoronary-artery embolism. Finally, the negative test for\\nantinuclear antibodies in this case makes the diagnosis\\nof systemic lupus erythematosus unlikely.\\nNonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis typically oc-\\ncurs in chronically ill patients, often those with under-\\nlying cancer. 19-21 This type of endocarditis frequently\\ninvolves previously normal valves and may give rise to\\ncoronary-artery emboli with infarction, but it rarely\\naffects more than one valve. Atrial myxomas have\\nprotean clinical manifestations, and the classic triad\\nconsists of constitutional signs and symptoms, valvu-\\nlar obstruction, and embolic phenomena. Murmurs of\\nmitral or tricuspid regurgitation can also occur be-\\ncause of impaired valve closure caused by the tumor.\\nHowever, two-dimensional echocardiographic exami-\\nnation detects myxomas in more than 90 percent of\\nthe cases. In Löffler\\'s endocarditis, an eosinophilic\\nmyocarditis is followed by biventricular mural en-\\ndocardial thickening with overlying thrombosis. Pro-\\ngressive mitral regurgitation is present in a third of\\nthe patients, and systemic embolism and congestive\\nheart failure are frequent. Endocardial plaques devel-\\nop in approximately half the patients with the carci-\\nnoid syndrome but are hemodynamically important\\nonly when the right-sided cardiac valves are involved.\\nThis patient, however, had no cutaneous flushing, diar-\\nrhea, or bronchoconstriction.\\nThe infectious agents causing culture-negative en-\\ndocarditis can be divided into three categories. The\\nfirst category includes bacteria that typically cause in-\\nfective endocarditis but are not detected in blood cul-\\ntures for various reasons. The principal reason is pre-\\nvious antimicrobial therapy. Many but not all studies\\nhave shown that previous antibiotic treatment sub-\\nstantially decreases the number of positive blood cul-\\ntures. Pesanti and Smith22 reported that 62 percent of\\ntheir patients with apparently culture-negative endo-\\ncarditis had received antibiotics before culture and\\nthat since 1966 twice as many patients with culture-\\nnegative endocarditis had received previous antibiotic\\ntherapy as those with culture-positive endocarditis.\\nPatients with partially treated endocarditis often have\\nan initial response to therapy but have a relapse when\\nthe antibiotics are discontinued. Unless several days\\nto two weeks elapse between discontinuing antibiotic\\ntherapy and obtaining blood for culture, apparently\\nculture-negative endocarditis may result. However,\\nthere is no history of previous antibiotic therapy in this\\npatient.\\nMural infective endocarditis, caused by deposition of\\nbacteria on sterile thrombi, is frequently associated\\nwith negative blood cultures.23 The lesion can occur in\\npatients with congenital heart disease, especially a ven-\\ntricular septal defect; mural thrombi after myocardial infarction; or indwelling central venous catheters or\\ntransvenous pacemakers.\\nRight-sided endocarditis usually presents as recur-\\nrent infected pulmonary emboli or recurrent pneumo-\\nnia. Since nowadays right-sided endocarditis occurs\\nmost often in intravenous drug abusers and is caused by\\nvirulent pyogenic bacteria, blood cultures are usually\\npositive. The less common right-sided endocarditis that\\nis caused by avirulent or fastidious organisms has a\\nmore subacute course and is frequently associated with\\nnegative blood cultures.23-25\\nThere is a high frequency of culture-negative bacte-\\nrial endocarditis in patients with uremia. 23,26,27 Villar-\\nreal and Sokoloff26 reviewed the records of 100 patients\\nwho died of subacute bacterial endocarditis, including\\n14 with established uremia and 9 with probable ure-\\nmia; in 14 of these 23 patients blood was drawn for cul-\\nture, and in 9 of them no bacteria were isolated. The\\nurea nitrogen levels ranged from 75 to 224 mg per dec-\\niliter (26.8 to 80.0 mmol per liter). The duration of ill-\\nness in these patients was not stated.\\nIn 1913 Libman28 noted that some patients with\\nspontaneously cured subacute bacterial endocarditis\\nhad a peculiar course, which he termed the \"bacteria-\\nfree stage\" of endocarditis. The syndrome is now rare\\nbecause of early diagnosis and treatment of subacute\\nbacterial endocarditis but may be seen when the dis-\\nease remains undiagnosed and untreated for months.\\nThis diagnosis can be proposed only in the absence of\\nmanifestations of active valvular infection. Therefore,\\nfever is absent and blood cultures are negative, al-\\nthough organisms may still be present in the vegeta-\\ntions. Renal insufficiency is prominent, as are spleno-\\nmegaly and brown pigmentation of the face and back\\nof the hands. Marked sternal tenderness is common,\\nanemia may be severe and progressive, and embolic\\nphenomena occur. Patients with this syndrome have\\nsurvived as long as three years and usually die of con-\\ngestive heart failure or progressive wasting.29\\nThe second category of organisms causing culture-\\nnegative infective endocarditis consists of slow-growing\\nor fastidious bacteria with special growth requirements\\nthat may not be met by standard culture techniques\\n(Table 4).23,24 Gram-negative bacilli such as haemophi-\\nlus are common causes of apparently culture-negative\\nendocarditis, with or without previous antimicrobial\\ntherapy. 24 These organisms may be isolated from the\\noropharynx in normal persons and may produce large\\nvegetations and systemic emboli. Even without previous\\nantimicrobial therapy, blood cultures may not become\\npositive for two weeks or longer. Blood cultures may\\nnot be recognized as positive unless Gram\\'s staining or\\nappropriate subculturing for these organisms is per-\\nformed.\\nCertain types of streptococci, often referred to as\\n“nutritionally deficient,” require a special medium for\\ngrowth. Culture with another organism (satellitism) or\\na medium supplemented with cysteine, thioglycolate, or\\nvitamin B is required for their growth. 23,24 Although these organisms rarely cause endocarditis, they should\\nbe considered when Gram\\'s staining of the primary\\nblood culture reveals gram-positive cocci that fail to\\ngrow on subculture in common mediums. Nutritionally\\ndeficient streptococci and fastidious gram-negative ba-\\ncilli probably account for most cases of culture-negative\\nendocarditis in patients without prosthetic valves who\\nhave had blood obtained for culture before the initia-\\ntion of antimicrobial therapy.\\nBrucella and neisseria species should also be consid-\\nered in patients with apparently culture-negative endo-\\ncarditis, especially when the history is suggestive of an\\nappropriate contact.30 However, all stages of brucellosis\\nare characterized by a high fever except for the chronic\\nstage, in which a low-grade fever and neuropsychiatric\\nmanifestations are common. Also, when brucella causes\\nendocarditis, peripheral embolism to large arteries is\\nvery common (88 percent in one series).31 Finally, pa-\\ntients with brucellosis almost always have a serologic\\nresponse, and brucella titers were negative in this pa-\\ntient.\\nGram-negative anaerobic endocarditis is rare and\\nwas associated with a mortality rate of 46 percent in\\none series.32 Bacteroides fragilis is the most common iso-\\nlate. Bacteroides species can be slow-growing, requir-\\ning up to three weeks for blood cultures to become pos-\\nitive.\\nCoryneform bacteria rarely cause disease in normal\\nhosts except for diphtheria in unimmunized patients.\\nHowever, these are opportunistic organisms and are relatively common causes of apparently culture-nega-\\ntive prosthetic-valve endocarditis.24 Acid-fast organ-\\nisms may cause apparently culture-negative endocar-\\nditis of native or prosthetic valves. Special culture\\ntechniques are required to identify these organisms.24\\nIt is tempting to consider other bacteria to which a\\nveterinarian might be exposed. Erysipelothrix causes\\nswine erysipelas and human erysipeloid and is an occu-\\npational hazard among meat and fish handlers and\\nveterinarians. Septicemia and endocarditis have been\\nreported in humans. 33-37 The organism may cause ex-\\ntensive destruction of previously normal heart valves,\\nabscess formation, uremia, and intractable heart fail-\\nure requiring emergency valve replacement.37 This or-\\nganism is a rare cause of apparently culture-negative\\nendocarditis.\\nLocal abscesses or cellulitis of the extremities caused\\nby Pasteurella multocida may follow bites or scratches\\nfrom infected dogs or cats.38 Although pasteurella sep-\\nticemia has been reported,39 endocarditis rarely, if ever,\\noccurs.\\nThe final category of agents causing apparently cul-\\nture-negative infective endocarditis comprises nonbac-\\nterial pathogens. Fungal endocarditis is usually caused\\nby candida or aspergillus species. Some observers rec-\\nommend that arterial-blood cultures be obtained if\\nfungal endocarditis is suspected, but it is not clear that\\nthey improve the diagnostic yield. The diagnosis of\\nfungal endocarditis should be considered in patients\\nwith apparently culture-negative endocarditis in an ap-\\npropriate clinical setting, such as prolonged use of\\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics, placement of an intrave-\\nnous cathether, immunosuppression with neutropenia,\\nlarge vegetations, major peripheral embolic phenome-\\nna, or the presence of a prosthetic valve.24 None of\\nthese settings pertain to this case. Although Q fever, a\\nrickettsial disease caused by Coxiella burnetii, has a\\nworldwide distribution and frequently infects sheep\\nand cattle in the United States, Q fever endocar-\\nditis40,41 is very rare outside Great Britain and Austral-\\nia. Nevertheless, this disorder should be considered in\\npatients who have been in contact with livestock or\\ntheir products. The diagnosis is routinely made on se-\\nrologic grounds, and serologic testing for coxiella was\\nnegative in this patient. Chlamydia psittaci is synony-\\nmous with psittacosis and raises the question of con-\\ntact with birds, especially parrots; it is also associated\\nwith a wide range of diseases in economically impor-\\ntant animals as well as domestic pets. 42 There is a case\\nreport of C. psittaci endocarditis that was probably\\nof feline origin.43 In addition, there is a report of sub-\\nacute chlamydial endocarditis accompanied by pro-\\ngressive renal failure, second-degree heart block, and\\ndestruction of both the aortic and the mitral valves,\\nrequiring double valve replacement.44 In many of the\\nreported cases the patients also had glomerulonephri-\\ntis. The syndrome of pneumonia with a persistently\\nhigh fever, unusually severe headache, myalgia, and a pulse-temperature dissociation may suggest the diag-\\nnosis, which must be established by serologic means.\\nThere was no serologic testing for chlamydia in this\\npatient.\\nIt is instructive, finally, to consider a reported series\\nof 52 patients with infective endocarditis and negative\\nblood cultures.22 Most of the patients were found to\\nhave been infected with common organisms or organ-\\nisms that were no longer evident within the vegetations.\\nPotentially responsible organisms were identified by ei-\\nther histologic studies or positive cultures in 18 of the\\n52 patients, and two thirds of the organisms identified\\nwere gram-positive cocci, including five staphylococcal\\nand five streptococcal isolates.\\nThe absence of fever is another interesting charac-\\nteristic of this case. Fever is present in 85 to 95 percent\\nof patients with infective endocarditis. The fever may\\nbe blunted, however, by partial antibiotic treatment,\\ncongestive heart failure, cerebral hemorrhage, old age,\\nor uremia and may be absent in the more chronic phas-\\nes of the disease.\\nTherefore, my diagnosis is culture-negative endocar-\\nditis, with the absence of fever and of positive blood\\ncultures related either to uremia or to the chronicity of\\nthe disease.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nEndocarditis of the aortic valve, with periaortic ex-\\ntension, culture-negative.\\nDR. STEPHEN A. ABRAHAM\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nCulture-negative endocarditis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. KATHLEEN K. HANSEN: The patient underwent\\ndébridement of the aortic-valve annulus and subannu-\\nlar tissue, with replacement of the aortic valve. The\\nfirst specimen that we received was an aggregate of\\nperiaortic and subaortic valvular tissue, 1.5 by 1.2 by\\n0.8 cm, corresponding to the calcific mass seen on\\nechocardiographic examination. After the aortic valve\\nhad been resected, there was further débridement of\\nthe subannular tissue. The leaflets were diffusely thick-\\nened and calcified, with no friable vegetations.\\nMicroscopical examination of the valves and the per-\\niaortic and subaortic valvular tissue showed fibrosis,\\ndense calcification, hemosiderin, and foci of chronic in-\\nflammation, suggesting healed or chronic endocarditis\\n(Fig. 4). Gram\\'s staining of tissue revealed rare gram-\\npositive bacterial colonies consistent with staphylococ-\\ncus. An intraoperative culture of tissue from the aortic\\nvalve and perivalvular tissue grew coagulase-negative\\nstaphylococcus, which is consistent with Staphylococcus\\nepidermidis. Cultures for bacteria, including mycobacte-\\nria, and for fungi were otherwise negative.\\nThis case highlights two interesting features of in-\\nfective endocarditis — namely, the nature of underly-\\ning cardiac lesions and the spectrum of organisms that have recently emerged. The settings in which in-\\nfective endocarditis occurs have changed over the past\\ntwo to three decades. A 1987 study of underlying car-\\ndiac lesions associated with infective endocarditis\\nshowed a decline in rheumatic and congenital lesions;\\nthe major associated findings were mitral-valve pro-\\nlapse (in 29 percent of the cases), no underlying le-\\nsions (in 27 percent), degenerative lesions (in 21 per-\\ncent), congenital heart disease (in 13 percent), and\\nrheumatic heart disease (in 6 percent).45 In this case\\nthe aortic valve was tricuspid, and no clinically appar-\\nent valvular disease was documented before the recent\\npresentation.\\nThe organisms responsible for infective endocarditis\\nhave also changed recently, in part because of antibiot-\\nic therapy and in part because of an increasingly im-\\nmunocompromised population. Staphylococcal infec-\\ntions account for approximately a third of all cases of\\nbacterial endocarditis.46 S. epidermidis accounts for a\\nquarter of all cases of prosthetic-valve endocarditis.\\nStreptococcal endocarditis, once the most common\\ntype, now accounts for a quarter of all cases of bacteri-\\nal endocarditis. A host of other bacteria can cause en-\\ndocarditis. Fungal endocarditis is less common. It is of\\ninterest that this man\\'s father died of complications\\nof subacute bacterial endocarditis due to a-hemolytic\\nstreptococcus and involving a bicuspid aortic valve. 47\\nThe patient\\'s cardiovascular status has remained\\nstable postoperatively. He continues to undergo dialysis\\nfor chronic renal failure.',\n",

       " \"A 44-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of severe respiratory distress, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and increasing pancytopenia.\\nThe patient had been well until 34 days earlier, when a cough productive of scanty whitish sputum developed. Treatment with erythromycin was unsuccessful. Progressive exertional dyspnea developed, and two weeks before entry she was admitted to another hospital. Examination showed that the temperature was 39.4°C; bilateral basal crackles were present. Radiographs of the chest revealed bilateral dense pulmonary infiltrates. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, and prednisone (40 mg twice daily) were administered.\\nOn the fourth hospital day a bronchoscopic examination was complicated by hypoxemia and worsening respiratory status; bronchoalveolar lavage of the right lower lobe was performed, and erythromycin was added to the medications. Laboratory studies were performed (Tables 1, 2, and 3). Microscopical examination of bronchoalveolar washings for fungi and Pneumocystis carinii was negative, as was examination of five sputum specimens for acid-fast bacilli; three blood cultures and a urine culture were also negative. A radionuclide ventilation-perfusion scan showed no matching defects. On the 13th hospital day trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was discontinued, and treatment with trimethoprim and dapsone was begun. On the next day the dyspnea was more severe; arterial-blood gas measurements were performed (Table 4). The trachea was intubated, and ventilatory assistance begun. Ceftazidime and ampicillin were given intravenously. The patient was transferred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was a native of Haiti who had immigrated to this country 17 years earlier. She was married and childless. There was a history of hypertension of six years' duration that was managed with hydrochlorothiazide-triamterene. A sister was a nurse in a Haitian tuberculosis sanitarium. The patient resided in Boston and had returned to Haiti frequently until five years earlier. There was no history of abuse of alcohol or intravenous drugs, other risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or exposure to animals or ill persons.\\nThe temperature was 38.8°C, the pulse was 150, and the blood pressure was 90/40 mm Hg.\\nOn physical examination the patient was critically ill and intubated, sedated, and pharmacologically paralyzed, with assisted ventilation and an indwelling bladder catheter. Ecchymoses and purpuric lesions were present on the arms, and purpuric lesions were present on the legs; several examiners believed that some of the purpuric lesions were palpable. No lymphadenopathy was detected. The head was normal; no conjunctival hemorrhages were seen. The neck was supple. Coarsened breath sounds and diffuse inspiratory crackles were heard bilaterally. The breasts were normal. Abdominal examination was negative, but the patient could not cooperate with examiners. No peripheral edema or digital clubbing was present. Rectal examination was negative; a stool specimen was negative for occult blood.\\nThe urine was positive (++) for protein; the sediment contained more than 100 red cells, 15 white cells, and 35 granular casts per high-power field. Laboratory studies were done (Tables 1 and 2), and arterial-blood gas levels were measured (Table 4). A radiograph of the chest, obtained with portable equipment, showed bilateral confluent air-space disease. No pleural effusions were seen, and the heart was not enlarged.\\nThe patient was admitted to a negative-pressure room in an intensive care unit, and a pulmonary arterial line was inserted. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture. Erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, hydrocortisone, and normal saline were administered intravenously. The blood pressure rose to 105/60 mm Hg on several occasions while vasopressor medications were being infused by vein, and the temperature increased to 38.9°C. While the arterial pressure was 105/55 mm Hg, the right ventricular pressure was 38/21 mm Hg, the pulmonary arterial pressure 39/26 mm Hg, the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure 26 mm Hg, and the central venous pressure 21 mm Hg. The cardiac output was 3.8 liters per minute, and the cardiac index was 2.2 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area.\\nEarly on the second hospital day the temperature remained 38.9°C, and physical examination was unchanged. The blood pressure was 90/50 mm Hg and fell to 70/50 mm Hg. Arterial-blood gas levels were measured (Table 4), and laboratory studies were performed (Tables 1 and 2). Norepinephrine was administered intravenously, and another blood specimen was drawn for culture. Another radiograph of the chest (Fig. 1) revealed progression of the lung opacities.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. SOLOMON R. BENATAR: This 44-year-old woman had a one-month history of a febrile respiratory tract illness that was unresponsive to several antibiotic agents and complicated by pancytopenia and hypoxemic respiratory failure. Serologic tests and microscopical examination of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid and blood and urine cultures showed no evidence of recent infection with hepatitis A, B, or C virus; legionella; toxoplasma; HIV; mycobacteria; fungi; or P. carinii. With only mild renal impairment, no red-cell casts in the urine, and no red cells in the bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid, the pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome seems unlikely. A test for antinuclear antibodies was negative, and there are no clues pointing to a collagen vascular disease. The progression of the disease in the absence of a pertinent history also makes a collagen vascular disease unlikely. The positive D-dimer test, elevated fibrinogen level, prolonged partial-thromboplastin time, reduced haptoglobin level, falling blood pressure, progressive hypoxemia and pulmonary opacification, deteriorating renal function, pancytopenia, purpura, ecchymoses, and reduced cardiac output during the administration of vasopressors indicate multiorgan failure.\\nMay we review the radiographic findings, Dr. McLoud?\\nDR. THERESA C. MCLOUD: The initial radiograph of the chest obtained at this hospital shows focal air-space disease throughout both lungs, with air bronchograms. The mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are difficult to evaluate because of the adjacent air-space disease. A film obtained 48 hours later (Fig. 1) shows air-space opacities involving almost the entire right lung, as well as the left lung, in a perihilar and basal distribution. The pattern is in part finely nodular but mostly consistent with confluent air-space disease. There is no cardiac enlargement, evidence of pleural disease, or cavitation within the opacities.\\nDR. BENATAR: This case is an example of the adult respiratory distress syndrome, first described almost 30 years ago. For many reasons, but particularly because of the mortality rate, which remains high, this syndrome continues to be of great medical interest. The spectrum of its causes is wide, ranging from transient events, such as hypotension and trauma, that initiate a self-limiting cascade of pathophysiologic events for which nonspecific supportive treatment may be lifesaving, to specific infections that, unless treated appropriately, are almost inevitably fatal. Transient causes, which include aspiration of gastric contents, multiple transfusions, cardiopulmonary bypass, and burns, are not considerations in this case. There is no evidence to suggest much less common disorders, including acute pancreatitis, disorders caused by toxins such as paraquat, collagen vascular diseases, diseases causing alveolar hemorrhage, metastatic malignant tumors (for example, choriocarcinoma), intracranial disease, and hematologic malignant tumors complicated by alveolar proteinosis. I shall also rule out the history of hypertension and its treatment as diagnostically irrelevant, but cardiac and renal damage could have contributed to cardiac and renal impairment during the course of this patient's illness.\\nThe patient had no risk factors for HIV infection, a negative HIV test, and a normal CD4 count in relation to the total white-cell count; she did not abuse alcohol or drugs and did not have responses to antibiotic agents that are effective against a wide spectrum of organisms. There are nevertheless several reasons for considering infection as a highly probable cause of her illness, including the fever, shift to the left in the neutrophil count, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and pancytopenia, as well as the patient's frequent visits to Haiti, which presumably involved contact with her sister, who worked in a tuberculosis sanitarium. If the underlying cause of the illness was an infection, the lack of response to the antibiotic agents that she received indicates a deep-seated infection (e.g., an occult abscess or osteitis) or the administration of drugs that were inappropriate for that infection. In the absence of a surgical procedure, penetrating injury, or underlying disease that could result in a predisposition to an indolent bacterial abscess and with negative blood cultures and no local signs, a deep-seated, indolent abscess appears an unlikely but nevertheless possible cause.\\nThe two chief diagnostic considerations at this stage are an untreated and progressive infectious disease involving the bone marrow and a hematologic disorder complicated by an infection unresponsive to the treatment given. Infection with an organism that has not been treated with appropriate drugs is my diagnosis of choice. Several possibilities deserve consideration. Leptospirosis seems unlikely in the absence of conjunctival suffusion, lymphadenopathy, rash, hepatomegaly, nuchal rigidity, myalgia, and jaundice. Malaria also seems improbable without a history of recent travel or transfusion, rigors, splenomegaly, or headache. Histoplasmosis generally occurs in specific geographic areas, including Haiti, but tuberculosis appears to be a more likely cause of infection, since it is much more common than histoplasmosis. All the features of this case can be explained on the basis of disseminated tuberculosis.\\nThe patient was at risk for tuberculosis. She grew up in Haiti, where she had visited regularly until five years ago and presumably had had contact with her sister who worked in a tuberculosis sanitarium. The duration of her illness is compatible with a diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis. The median duration of symptoms in a recent series of 109 patients with miliary tuberculosis was 4 weeks, with a range of 1 to 52 weeks. The multisystem involvement is typical, and the association with the adult respiratory distress syndrome, although unusual, is well recognized. The duration of symptoms before this syndrome develops is longer in patients with tuberculosis than in those with other bacterial infections. Several reports have documented the features of the adult respiratory distress syndrome in association with miliary tuberculosis. Because less than 7 percent of patients with miliary tuberculosis present with this syndrome, radiographs of the chest usually do not show the typical miliary pattern, and examination of bronchial secretions generally fails to reveal Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the diagnosis is often made only late in the course of infection or at autopsy. The addition of the adult respiratory distress syndrome to other “cryptic” presentations of miliary tuberculosis makes it important to consider disseminated tuberculosis whenever the adult respiratory distress syndrome is unexplained.\\nWith regard to the pathophysiologic features, infectious agents that provoke septic shock and the adult respiratory distress syndrome probably do so through the release of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, and other toxic substances derived from platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, activated complement, and metabolites of membrane phospholipids. Thrombocytopenia, a shift to the left in the neutrophil count, pancytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, abnormal results of liver-function tests, and ultimately, multiorgan failure with hemodynamic features of septic shock have all been described in patients with tuberculosis and the adult respiratory distress syndrome who did not have any associated bacterial infection. Lipoarabinomannan from M. tuberculosis has been shown to stimulate the release of tumor necrosis factor from human-blood monocytes and activated peritoneal macrophages in vitro. It has been speculated that lipoarabinomannan or other mycobacterial products may function in vivo like bacterial lipopolysaccharide. The diffuse alveolar consolidation that characterizes the adult respiratory distress syndrome is thus due to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema resulting from pulmonary capillary vasoconstriction and damage to pulmonary capillaries and alveolar epithelium by these mediators. Thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and abnormal results of liver-function tests are often reported in patients with miliary tuberculosis and can be explained on the basis of the granulomatous response to multiorgan infection. When the adult respiratory distress syndrome occurs in such patients, the Mantoux test is usually negative, acid-fast bacilli are identified in sputum samples from only about a third of the patients, and the mortality rate ranges from 57 to 89 percent.\\nWith regard to the pancytopenia in the patient under discussion, I shall mention three possible causes. The first and least likely in this context is a drug reaction, which would not account for other features of the case. The second possibility is that an underlying hematologic disorder caused the pancytopenia and through associated immune impairment conferred a predisposition to the reactivation and dissemination of a previously dormant M. tuberculosis infection. Several reports have suggested that pancytopenia in association with miliary tuberculosis reflects an underlying primary hematologic disease. Such a disorder is unlikely in the patient under consideration, however, because pancytopenia developed during the course of her illness, and it is well documented that pancytopenia can be due to tuberculosis and respond to appropriate antituberculosis treatment. In a retrospective survey of 109 adults treated for miliary tuberculosis at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, from 1978 to 1987, thrombocytopenia was recorded in 83 percent of the patients, leukopenia in 15 percent, lymphopenia in 87 percent, and pancytopenia in 5 percent; in 3 of the 6 patients with pancytopenia it was reversed by antituberculosis treatment.\\nA primary malignant hematologic tumor cannot be ruled out, however, for two reasons. First, pancytopenia accompanying miliary tuberculosis and apparently responding to treatment may nevertheless be associated with an underlying malignant hematologic tumor that is detected only with repeated bone marrow biopsies during the follow-up period. Second, a malignant tumor can mimic miliary tuberculosis. Close et al. have reported an unusual presentation of an anaplastic, large-cell Ki-1 lymphoma with pulmonary involvement that mimicked miliary tuberculosis; transbronchial and bone marrow biopsies and, eventually, an autopsy confirmed the presence of lymphoma and the absence of tuberculosis.\\nAn additional feature of this case points to another possible alternative to the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis. Cardiac catheterization showed elevated pulmonary-capillary wedge, right ventricular, pulmonaryartery, and central venous pressures, with no step down in pressure from the wedge position, suggesting either cardiac tamponade or pericardial constriction. Tuberculosis with pericardial and myocardial involvement could explain these findings. In a series of 109 patients with miliary tuberculosis, the adult respiratory distress syndrome developed in 7 patients, and pericardial tamponade developed in 2. Lymphoma may also involve the myocardium and pericardium. Although the cardiac findings support a unifying diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis, I cannot rule out an underlying malignant tumor.\\nA final consideration is whether the mild hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypotension were merely due to renal dysfunction and disordered fluid balance in a very ill patient or whether tuberculosis of the adrenal glands was a contributing factor. Although adrenal involvement has been reported in patients with miliary tuberculosis, it is uncommon.\\nIn conclusion, disseminated tuberculosis with pulmonary, bone marrow, hepatic, and cardiac involvement, possible adrenal involvement, and probable involvement of many other organs is the most likely diagnosis in this case. Disseminated histoplasmosis is much less likely in the absence of recent exposure. I cannot rule out an underlying hematologic disorder, but its presence is not necessary to explain the patient's illness. It is also impossible to rule out an unusual presentation of lymphoma. The therapeutic and prognostic implications of a diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis make it mandatory that this disorder be put at the top of the list of possible diagnoses. The high mortality rate among patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome in association with miliary tuberculosis requires early consideration of this diagnosis when a patient presents with a subacute form of the syndrome for which there is no alternative explanation, initial investigations do not reveal any other infectious cause, and there has been no response to initial antibiotic therapy.\\nWhat was the diagnostic procedure? The severity of the pulmonary impairment would have increased the risk associated with a lung biopsy, and reasonable alternatives would have been bone marrow and liver biopsies. In the series of 109 patients with miliary tuberculosis the diagnosis was made by fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination in 44 of 51 patients, bone marrow examination in 19 of 22 patients, and liver biopsy in all 10 patients in whom it was undertaken. Granulomas were observed in 63 percent of the transbronchial-biopsy specimens, caseation was seen in 42 percent, and acid-fast bacilli were seen in 30 percent on Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Granulomas were detected in 82 percent of the bone marrow specimens, and caseation was found in 41 percent, but acid-fast bacilli were not seen on direct staining in any specimens. Twelve of the 23 transbronchial-biopsy specimens were positive on mycobacterial culture, as compared with 3 of 40 bone marrow specimens. A bone marrow biopsy would have been the most appropriate approach in the case under discussion, for several reasons. First, it would have been the safest procedure; second, in the presence of hematologic abnormalities, the diagnostic yield for tuberculosis would have been high; and third, if there had been an underlying malignant hematologic tumor, it could also have been detected.\\nWith regard to the prognosis, in the series described by Maartens et al. an age over 60 years, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and delayed treatment were independent predictors of death. Since the patient met four of these criteria, the possibility that she might die before appropriate antituberculosis treatment could be effective was high.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDisseminated tuberculosis.\\nDR. SOLOMON R. BENATAR'S DIAGNOSIS\\nDisseminated tuberculosis, with pulmonary, bone marrow, hepatic, cardiac, and adrenal involvement.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: A bone marrow needle biopsy was performed. Empirical antituberculosis therapy was begun with intravenously administered isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, and ofloxacin. Examination of another bronchoalveolar-lavage specimen by fluorescence microscopy showed a few mycobacteria. Despite the antibiotic therapy and the administration of fluids and pressors, the patient became increasingly hypoxic and hypotensive and died on the second hospital day.\\nAt autopsy the lungs weighed 2250 g - approximately three times the normal weight. After inflation and fixation with formalin, examination of their cut surfaces showed a central white consolidation, which produced the air bronchograms centrally, and peripheral white-yellow nodules, 2 to 4 mm in diameter (Fig. 2). Microscopical examination revealed thick hyaline membranes lining alveolar ducts and alveoli, indicating acute diffuse alveolar damage of a few days' duration. Foci of necrosis with fibrin and either few inflammatory cells or scattered microabscesses containing neutrophils were also present (Fig. 3). The foci of necrosis were teeming with acid-fast mycobacteria (Fig. 4); fewer organisms were seen in regions of diffuse alveolar damage. No tuberculous granulomas were present. The sparse cellular response is characteristic of a form of tuberculosis known as sepsis tuberculosa acutissima and nonreactive tuberculosis. Pulmonary gangrene is another form of overwhelming tuberculosis with vascular thrombosis and necrosis and a diminished cellular response.\\nPaucicellular necrotic micronodules were numerous in the liver, spleen, and adrenal glands. Occasional multinucleated histiocytes rimmed the areas of necrosis. The adrenal cortex was only 1 mm thick. Some glomeruli had segmental necrosis, which also involved Bowman's space and periglomerular tubules (Fig. 5). Acid-fast mycobacteria were present in the necrotic areas. The only compact, discrete granulomas were in the bone marrow (Fig. 6). The bone marrow specimen obtained before death contained half a granuloma but no stainable organisms. The heart was not involved. M. tuberculosis grew in culture.\\nIn the proximal jejunum we found two discrete, firm, purple, centrally ulcerated, 1-cm nodules protruding into the lumen. Microscopical examination showed Kaposi's sarcoma (Fig. 7). The combination of tuberculosis with a poor cellular response and Kaposi's sarcoma suggested the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, but a repeated serologic test for HIV infection was negative. In addition, no opportunistic organisms were present. The ecchymotic and purpuric lesions on the arms and legs proved to be ectatic vessels with focal fibrin thrombi, not Kaposi's sarcoma.\\nDR. HOWARD KESSELMAN: Is pancytopenia in association with disseminated tuberculosis due directly to the replacement of bone marrow by granulomas, or do the granulomas suppress the bone marrow through cytokines?\\nDR. BENATAR: The pancytopenia is usually associated with granulomatous inflammation of the bone marrow. Bone marrow necrosis has also been described. These findings suggest a direct effect. Mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan triggers the release of tumor necrosis factor a, and there is some evidence that this cytokine may contribute to the diminished hematopoiesis.\\nDR. MARK: Do you think that the evidence of immuno incompetence in this patient might have predisposed her to the adult respiratory distress syndrome?\\nDR. BENATAR: My colleagues in Cape Town described three patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome and miliary tuberculosis in the early 1980s and reviewed the literature at that time, which included 26 patients. In a subsequent report on 109 patients with miliary tuberculosis, the adult respiratory distress syndrome was a feature in only 7 of them. Thus, the syndrome is a relatively rare manifestation, even in South Africa, where tuberculosis is common and the patients often present with severe illness in the late phase of the disease.\\nThe histologic features seen in the patient under discussion were described by Proudfoot et al. in their report on miliary tuberculosis in adults. Sixteen of the 40 patients whom they described did not have the usual clinical and radiographic features of miliary tuberculosis. A nonreactive form of tuberculosis, characterized by widespread necrosis with numerous organisms and little cellular immune response, was noted. That study was performed before the era of HIV. Ten of 16 patients with cryptic disseminated tuberculosis had other serious diseases, as compared with 13 of 24 patients with classic miliary tuberculosis. Seventy-five percent of the patients in both groups survived. Diseases causing immunosuppression thus do not seem to be invariably associated with nonreactive tuberculosis, although occult disorders that could result in immunosuppression should be considered.\\nHow frequently are unexplained cases of Kaposi's sarcoma detected at autopsy?\\nDR. MARK: Kaposi's sarcoma of the small intestine is very rare, other than among elderly men from Mediterranean and African areas where the disease is endemic. Gastrointestinal Kaposi's sarcoma may precede cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma in the endemic form of the disease.\\nDR. KESSELMAN: What role might the steroid therapy have had in this patient, who had presumably been given steroids as presumptive treatment for P. carinii infection?\\nDR. BENATAR: Although I do not think that P. carinii infection was a serious consideration in this patient since she did not have HIV, the inappropriate use of steroids, without antituberculosis treatment, could well have been an aggravating factor. When given simultaneously with antituberculosis therapy, steroids can be of therapeutic value in patients with disseminated tuberculosis. One indication for steroids is their use as replacement therapy when there is adrenal failure. Another indication is their use as antiinflammatory agents in the presence of severe pulmonary dysfunction.\\nDR. MARK: In Brazil tuberculosis is also the common respiratory cause of death in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Pneumocystis infection is rare. In a series of 112 patients with tuberculosis in Tanzania, dyspnea, fever, night sweats, fatigue, diarrhea, severe tachypnea, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy were more common in the patients with HIV infection than in those without HIV infection, but the thoracic radiographic features did not differ between the two groups. The majority of patients with HIV infection and a CD4 T-lymphocyte count below 200 per cubic millimeter have atypical radiographic features of tuberculosis.\\nDR. ALBERT KO: What was the contribution of the reactivation of a previous pulmonary infection as compared with exogenous reinfection in this patient?\\nDR. BENATAR: I think that in most adults disseminated tuberculosis results from the reactivation of a primary focus that spreads into the bloodstream, with wide dissemination, often in the context of alcoholism, diabetes, or other chronic disease that sets the scene for reactivation of a previous infection. Miliary tuberculosis can also develop from an initial infection or a reinfection, which is more likely in severely immunocompromised patients.\",\n",
       " 'A 25-year-old Hispanic woman in the 27th week of pregnancy came to the emergency room complaining of cough and shortness of breath. She reported that she had been well until two days earlier. In the past day she had also been nauseated, and she had vomited once. In the emergency room she was found to have a temperature of 38°C (100.5°F) and was thought to be dehydrated. Intravenous fluids, ampicillin, and gentamicin were administered. She was given a prescription for erythromycin and sent home. She returned the next day because she was more dyspneic and explained that she had coughed up a half-cup of blood. She also reported that she had been treated with antibiotics one month earlier for a presumed upper respiratory infection. Since then she had been tired and short of breath. Four previous pregnancies and deliveries had been unremarkable. Four years earlier she had been treated for tuberculosis. On examination her temperature was 38.6°C (101.4°F), her pulse was 120 to 130 beats per minute, her blood pressure was 94/50 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate was 30 per minute. The cardiac examination was considered to be unremarkable, but the chest examination revealed bibasilar rhonchi and wheezes. Her arterial oxygen saturation was 94 percent while she was breathing oxygen at a rate of 2 liters per minute.\\n\\nThe serum sodium and potassium, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine concentrations were normal. The hematocrit was 35 percent; the white-cell count was 9900 per cubic millimeter with 82 percent neutrophils and 4 percent band forms; the platelet count was 230,000 per cubic millimeter. The urinalysis was unremarkable. Arterial-blood gas values measured while the patient was breathing 2 liters of supplemental oxygen per minute were as follows: partial pressure of oxygen, 61 mm Hg; partial pressure of carbon dioxide, 26 mm Hg; pH 7.44; and calculated bicarbonate concentration, 17 mmol per liter. Her chest film is shown in Figure 1.\\n\\nThe patient was treated with fluids and intravenous erythromycin (500 mg every six hours), but she became increasingly dyspneic and was airlifted to a tertiary care center. On arrival she had an arterial oxygen saturation of 40 percent, and she was immediately intubated. The fluid suctioned from the endotracheal tube was pink and frothy. The physical examination revealed jugular venous distention to the angle of the jaw. The cardiac examination disclosed tachycardia (120 beats per minute and regular); S₁ and S₂ were audible; no gallops or murmurs were heard. Examination of the chest revealed diffuse rhonchi. She had no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema of the arms and legs.\\n\\nThe electrocardiogram is shown in Figure 2 and the chest film obtained after the patient was intubated in Figure 3.\\n\\nThe patient was treated with ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, and isoniazid. A Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted and the following initial findings were obtained: pulmonary-artery pressure, 58/39 mm Hg; pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure, 35 mm Hg; central venous pressure, 20 mm Hg; cardiac output, 4.75 liters per minute; and systemic vascular resistance, 779 dyn.sec.cm⁻⁵.\\nThe patient was treated with furosemide; her systolic pressure fell to 60 mm Hg and metabolic acidosis developed.

       " '1208THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE Nov. 2, 1995 CLINICAL PROBLEM-SOLVING In this Journal feature, information about a real patient is presented in stages (boldface type) to an expert clinician, who responds to the information, sharing his or her reasoning with the reader (regular type). The authors\\' commentary follows. TESTING, TESTING, TESTING ... CHAIM PUTTERMAN, M.D., AND ELDAD BEN-CHETRIT, M.D. A 55-year-old woman presented with polyar-ticular arthritis. She had had several attacks of symmetric arthritis during the previous few months, involving particularly the ankles, shoul-ders, and metacarpophalangeal and proximal in-terphalangeal joints. She also reported morning stiffness and fatigue, but no other systemic symp-toms. No infection or febrile illness preceded the onset of her symptoms. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. The patient\\'s age, the onset of symptoms, and the clinical picture support a presumptive diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. The absence of fever and the chronic, relapsing course are inconsistent with most in-fectious arthritides. A reactive arthritis is also unlikely, since the patient had had no recent infection or febrile illness. I would also consider arthritis associated with other connective-tissue diseases. The physical examination revealed symmetric synovitis involving the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of several fin-gers, without deformities. No rash, nodules, or ul-cers were present. The examination supports the diagnosis of early rheumatoid arthritis, without systemic involvement. I would like to see a urinalysis, complete blood count, se-rum uric acid measurement, and autoantibody profile including rheumatoid factor, as well as an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein measure-ment as base-line indicators of inflammation. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 60 mm per hour, the test for antinuclear antibodies was negative, and that for rheumatoid factor was pos-itive at a titer of 1:2560. The complete blood count and differential count were normal, as were the results of blood-chemistry tests and tests of liver From the Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, N.Y.

X-ray films of the wrists showed no erosions or deformities. I think the diagnosis of seropositive rheumatoid ar-thritis is reasonably well established. Although the presence of rheumatoid factor is of prognostic value in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the exact titer is less important in this respect. The normal serum uric acid concentration, the lack of calcifications on the wrist films, and the clinical presentation are all incompatible with crystal-induced arthritis. The absence of a positive assay for antinuclear antibodies and other supporting data eliminates serious consideration of systemic lupus erythematosus. I would now begin to treat the patient with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs) for mild rheumatoid arthritis. NSAIDs were initially effective, but subse-quently the patient continued to have active ar-thritis despite receiving the maximal tolerated doses of several medications from this class. Low doses of a corticosteroid were given, and later methotrexate was used to maintain the patient in remission. The combination of methylpredniso-lone, naproxen, and methotrexate was effective, and the patient did well except for infrequent ar-thralgia that responded to analgesics. However, ligament subluxation and Jaccoud\\'s arthropathy developed. I would be encouraged by the good response. How-ever, it is not unusual to observe fluctuations in disease activity. The development of ligamentous subluxation might point toward subclinical progression of the dis-ease, which some physicians would consider an indica-tion for more aggressive therapy. Other objective labo-ratory measures of disease activity would be of interest. I would probably increase the dose of methotrexate. Four years later the patient discontinued ther-apy with methylprednisolone, naproxen, and meth-otrexate and began using an oral herbal mixture. Several weeks later she presented with an urticar-ial rash involving the flexor surfaces of both legs. The herbal preparation was discontinued, but the rash persisted for several weeks. The rash without fever seems to be clearly related to the discontinuation of the therapeutic regimen and the beginning of the herbal medication. Vasculitis, which this rash may represent, may be a skin manifestation of active systemic rheumatoid arthritis. However, isolated skin involvement without arthritis or other signs and symptoms is not consistent with a flare of the rheuma-toid arthritis.

Usually, a drug reaction in-volves the arms and the trunk and only later spreads to the lower limbs. A medication-induced allergic rash is often pruritic and sometimes persists despite the dis-continuation of the offending agent. I definitely agree that the herbal medication should be discontinued. If the rash persists, I would obtain a skin biopsy. I would want a complete blood count with measurement of eo-sinophils, serum IgE, and urinalysis. Corticosteroid ther-apy should be considered if the rash persists. The herbal mixture was found to contain mefe-namic acid and diazepam. A skin biopsy revealed eosinophilic infiltration of the skin, but no vascu-litis. A complete blood count showed 15,000 white cells per cubic millimeter, with 40 percent eosin-ophils. Many drugs can induce rash. However, both diaz-epam and mefenamic acid are relatively rare causes of cutaneous allergy. The degree of eosinophilia is very surprising to me. It may have been previously sup-pressed by the corticosteroid the patient was receiving. Although a drug reaction is still a possibility, the high eosinophil count and the skin infiltration make me se-riously doubt this diagnosis. Eosinophilia can occur in rheumatoid arthritis, but only in active disease with severe systemic involvement. Clearly, this is not the case here. Because the rash is not vasculitic and there is infiltration of tissue, idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome leads my list of diagnoses, but parasitic dis-ease, epithelial tumor, or lymphoma is still possible. Allergic disorders do not seem to be a consideration because there is no compatible history of asthma or rhinitis. Also, eosinophilic pneumonia or the eosino-philia-myalgia syndrome can be excluded. I would like to see the results of another complete blood count, se-rum IgE assay, urinalysis, blood-chemistry profile, chest film, and analysis of stool for ova and parasites. The physical examination revealed normal vital signs and slight pallor. There was dullness to per-cussion and decreased breath sounds over the posterior basal left lung field. No active synovitis or arthritis was present, and no rheumatoid nod-ules were found. The gynecologic and rectal ex-aminations were normal. A stool guaiac test was positive for occult blood. Several fresh stool sam-ples yielded no ova or parasites. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 135 mm per hour, the he-moglobin was 9.7 g per deciliter, and the hemato-crit was 30 percent; there were 15,000 to 20,000 white cells per cubic millimeter, with 30 to 50 per-cent mature eosinophils; the platelet count was 450,000 per cubic millimeter. The red cells were microcytic and hypochromic, with slight anisocy-tosis and poikilocytosis. Electrolyte concentrations and kidney function were normal. The following serum values were measured: alanine aminotransferase, 56 U per li-ter; aspartate aminotransferase, 40 U per liter; lactate dehydrogenase, 645 U per liter (normal, 60 to 200); and creatine kinase, 150 U per liter (normal, 5 to 150). The serum albumin level was 3.1 g per deciliter, and the globulin level was 3.8 g per deciliter. The levels of complement C3 and C4 were normal; immunoelectrophoresis showed 1929 mg of IgG per deciliter (normal, 564 to 1765), 194 mg of IgA per deciliter (normal, 85 to 385), and 618 mg of IgM per deciliter (normal, 45 to 250). The test for antinuclear antibodies was negative, and that for rheumatoid factor was pos-itive at a titer of 1:5120. On the chest film the heart was normal in size, and there was a moder-ate left pleural effusion. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes. The serum CA-125 value was three times normal. The physical findings do not support a diagnosis of active rheumatoid arthritis. Most parasitic infections can also be excluded with confidence because of the negative stool samples. We are dealing, then, with a new, inflammatory, multisystem disease causing gastro-intestinal bleeding, impaired liver function, pleural ef-fusion, and possible cardiomyopathy. My two leading diagnoses at this point are the idiopathic hypereosino-philic syndrome and tumor-associated eosinophilia. Eosinophilic leukemia is unlikely because all the eosin-ophils are mature. Of major concern would be ovarian carcinoma, since this particular tumor is associated with both eosinophilia and increased CA-125 values. In tumor-associated eosinophilia, however, eosinophils are either near and around the tumor or circulating in the blood. Therefore, I would be hard pressed to explain in-filtration of tumor-free organs such as the skin. At this point I think that the presence of eosinophils and their toxic products (from whatever cause) is instrumental in the patient\\'s clinical deterioration, and I would elect to begin corticosteroid treatment immediately. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy showed no tumor. The results of mammography and pelvic ultrasonography were normal. A com-puted tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a thickened, infiltrated peritoneum and omentum, with a questionable mass in the duode-num that was not seen on endoscopy. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed only an increase in eosinophilic precursors, without evidence of can-cer. Biopsy of the pleura revealed chronic inflam-mation with a slight increase in eosinophils. There were no granulomas, nodules, or vasculitis. Over a period of a few weeks, nausea and persistent vomiting developed, with a marked decrease in ca-loric intake. The patient\\'s serum albumin level dropped to 2.1 g per deciliter and her hematocrit to 25 percent.

Vol. 333 No. 18 CLINICAL PROBLEM-SOLVING 1210 No ovarian or uterine tumor is present, and the ab-sence of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly excludes lymphoma from consideration. Although the endoscop-ic examinations have ruled out a gastrointestinal can-cer, a duodenal biopsy could have been helpful in doc-umenting eosinophilic infiltration as the cause for the gastrointestinal manifestations. This patient is obviously deteriorating, and, once again, no time should be lost in treating her with corticosteroids. Hydroxyurea may also be necessary, depending on the response to corti-costeroids. Laparoscopy performed under general anes-thesia was noncontributory and was converted to a formal explorative laparotomy. The right ovary was enlarged and was resected. A full-thickness biopsy of the small bowel and a wedge biopsy of the liver were performed. The pathological exam-ination found no evidence of cancer in any of the specimens but, rather, infiltration of the small in-testine and liver with eosinophils. Postoperative-ly, prednisone therapy was begun at a daily dose of 30 mg. Within several weeks, there was a dra-matic improvement in the patient\\'s clinical condi-tion. The gastrointestinal symptoms ceased, and the patient returned to her base-line weight and appetite level. The rash resolved, the serum albu-min level rose to 4.0 g per deciliter, and the hem-atocrit rose to 40 percent. Three months after the operation, the patient continued to do well. COMMENTARY the At some point in any diagnostic workup, the clinician may make a decision that it is time to stop testing and to start treating. In the case of the patient described here, we have an example of how two physicians patient\\'s physician and the discussant apparently had quite different approaches to this decision. Before recommending treatment, the surfeit of tests ordered by the patient\\'s physician (who, for the sake of conven-ience, we will call the “liberal tester”) included upper and lower endoscopy, mammography, pelvic ultra-sonography, abdominal CT scanning, bone marrow as-piration and biopsy, pleural biopsy, laparoscopy, and exploratory laparotomy. The discussant (the “parsimo-nious tester\") made a tentative diagnosis of the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome and appeared to be comfortable recommending corticosteroid therapy for the patient without the additional tests carried out by the liberal tester. In fact, the parsimonious tester (an allergist and immunologist) seemed to be willing to prescribe treat-ment when the only information at hand included standard blood tests, a battery of immunologic studies, and the results of a skin biopsy. We can probably never fully understand the differ-Nov. 2, 1995 ences between the decisions of these two physicians, yet it behooves us to try, since so much criticism has been leveled at excessive testing in the debate over health care costs. One reasonable hypothesis is that in the case described here, the principal difference be-tween the parsimonious tester and the liberal tester was the diagnostic hypothesis that each was pursuing, and the protocol gives some clues as to why this dif-ference occurred. The parsimonious tester made the point that the eosinophils in the blood could be ex-plained by cells originating in a tumor but the eosino-phils in the skin could not. Even though the patient\\'s microcytic anemia and positive stool guaiac test could have had another ominous cause, the parsimonious tester relied on the existing evidence to make a recom-mendation to begin treatment for the hypereosinophil-ic syndrome. On the basis of the lack of a causal con-nection between the skin findings and the existence of any putative tumor, he appears to have assumed that the positive test for CA-125 was a false positive result; later in his comments we learn that he attributed the gastrointestinal bleeding to eosinophilic infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract. By contrast, we can assume from the multiple tests carried out by the liberal tester that for this physician, the diagnostic hypothesis of a hidden cancer particularly one in the gastrointesti-nal tract remained uppermost, and that the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome, though it may have remained a real possibility, was dismissed for the time being while a diagnosis of cancer was pursued just about as far as it could be. No number of noninvasive tests suf-ficed to convince the liberal tester that cancer had been ruled out. Should we reward the parsimonious tester and throw stones at the liberal tester? We believe that the choice either to halt testing or to continue it in this patient\\'s case was not an easy one. Even though the hypereosin-ophilic syndrome is a rare condition,1-3 the testing deci-sion that faced the patient\\'s physician is familiar to phy-sicians whose practices are devoted in some part to the solution of diagnostic problems. Although the liberal tester\\'s decision not to treat without exhaustive testing seems inappropriate in retrospect, the decision is often not clear at the time. Whether to treat or to continue testing depends on several factors; among these are how strongly convinced the physician is of a given diagnosis, the benefits and risks of available treatments, and the potential yield and risks of any further tests.⁴ In a case such as this one, the physician who is con-vinced on the basis of a patient\\'s history, physical examination, and a few dozen harmless laboratory tests that a particular disease (hypereosinophilic syn-drome) is highly likely, and who believes that cortico-steroid therapy is not only effective for the syndrome but also not highly toxic, would have little interest in further testing. Any further testing, this physician be-lieves, would probably only increase the likelihood of the disease and might even cause unwanted side effects. This reasoning is appropriate, though certainly many who are less experienced with the hypereosinophilic The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

Vol. 333 No. 18 CLINICAL PROBLEM-SOLVING 1211 syndrome than the discussant would be uncomfortable with it. In fact, the decision to treat the patient for the hy-pereosinophilic syndrome can even be considered a di-agnostic test. If the patient responded to treatment im-mediately, the diagnosis of hypereosinophilic syndrome would become more likely; if there were no response, further studies would be warranted. Even if the patient responded initially to corticosteroid therapy, it would certainly be reasonable, given the suggestive evidence of cancer of the gastrointestinal tract, to continue stud-ies that might identify a bleeding gastrointestinal le-sion. Although the parsimonious tester was silent on further testing and recommended corticosteroid thera-py early in the patient\\'s course, we do not know wheth-er if he had actually encountered this patient in his practice he would have ordered at least the relatively noninvasive gastrointestinal studies. Given the risk of missing a cancer, one could hardly criticize him for do-ing so. Clearly, diagnostic uncertainty and the risks of treat-ing are not the only factors that account for excessive testing. Testing habits that are difficult to erase, the simple availability of sophisticated technology, concern about malpractice, pressure from patients and their families, time constraints that limit the physician\\'s will-ingness to contemplate data before ordering a test, the fear of missing a crucial diagnosis,5-7 and simple zeal for the attainment of diagnostic certainty are all in-ducements to test. If the parsimonious tester had been in charge of her care, the patient might have had the same outcome but probably would have been spared at least some of the invasive tests, including laparoscopy and laparotomy. When cancer looms as a possible diagnosis, one can hardly fault liberal testers, yet we know that overtesting continues to be widespread. What can we do about it? No number of practice guidelines or fixed algorithms will prevent overtesting in patients similar to the one described here. We have to continue to insist that each particularly those that entail discomfort or risk test be preceded by a conscious decision that it is needed and that the decision be based on solid evidence when-ever possible. When data are available, we can rely on quantitative methods that have assessed the value of various tests, and we can encourage those engaged in technology assessment to examine the value of new tests before they are overused. We must stop ordering tests that have little chance of changing the scope of diagnostic possibilities. We must become increasingly comfortable with uncertain-ty; not every diagnosis must be nailed down with the final test or the ultimate histologic analysis before we embark on a course of therapy. Finally, rather than throwing stones at the liberal testers, we should try to understand their reasons for ordering too many tests. We should take a page from our own archives. Perhaps by identifying the causes of excessive testing, we can do better at recommending the cure. REFERENCES 1. Parrillo JE, Fauci AS, Wolff SM. Therapy of the hypereosinophilic syn-drome.

EBELING, Assistant EditorCASE 9-1996PRESENTATION OF CASEA 21-year-old woman was admitted to the hospitalbecause of thoracolumbar pain.The patient had been well until 17 weeks earlier, whenshe began to have pain in the midline thoracolumbar re-gion of the spine, with radiation to the right flank, ac-companied by nocturnal fever. The pain was aggravatedby coughing, sneezing, straining, and recumbency andwas not relieved by acetaminophen.Fourteen weeks before admission she came to this hos-pital. Her temperature was 38°C. The physical examina-tion was normal except for tenderness in the right costo-vertebral angle and a narrow introitus that prevented adigital examination. The urine was normal, except thatthe sediment contained 4 red cells per high-power field,8 white cells per high-power field, and moderate num-bers of bacteria per high-power field. The hematocritwas 36.4 percent; the white-cell count was 5500 per cu-bic millimeter, with 71 percent neutrophils, 20 percentlymphocytes, 8 percent monocytes, and 1 percent eosin-ophils. A urine culture yielded abundant lactobacilli.The urea nitrogen concentration was 5 mg per deciliter(2 mmol per liter). The values for creatinine, glucose,conjugated and total bilirubin, electrolytes, amylase, as-partate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, andalkaline phosphatase were normal, and a test for humanchorionic gonadotropin was negative.Radiographs of the chest and abdomen were normal.An ultrasonographic examination of the upper portion ofthe abdomen showed a normal appearance of the liver,gallbladder, pancreas, and kidneys. Radiographs of thethoracolumbar spine were normal. The patient had un-dergone pharaonic circumcision at the age of five years,with amputation of the cervix and nearly complete oblit-eration of the vaginal orifice. An antibiotic agent and anonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug were prescribed, andthe patient\\'s condition improved for a time.Three weeks before admission the pain worsened; itwas exacerbated by walking, sneezing, and laughing andwas accompanied by nocturnal fever. The patient re-turned to this hospital. The physical examination, includ-ing a neurologic examination, was unremarkable. Thehematocrit was 37.6 percent, the white-cell count was5000 per cubic millimeter, the platelet count was 358,000per cubic millimeter, and the erythrocyte sedimentationrate was 56 mm per hour. The urea nitrogen concentra-tion was 5 mg per deciliter, and the total protein concen-tration was 8.1 g per deciliter (albumin, 3.4; globulin, 4.7).The values for uric acid, glucose, calcium, phosphorus,electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, amylase, and al-kaline phosphatase were normal.Radiographs of the thoracolumbar spine (Fig. 1)showed an osteolytic lesion in the proximal right 11th rib,which was confirmed on coned views; that rib did not ar-ticulate normally, in contrast to the left 11th rib. Therewas no evidence of intervertebral disk disease. A comput-ed tomographic (CT) scan of the lower thoracic spine(Fig. 2) showed a soft-tissue mass to the right of T11,which extended into the neural foramina and involvedthe proximal portion of the right 11th rib.

The masshad the same signal intensity as muscle on T₁-weightedimages and was hyperintense on T2-weighted images,with heterogeneous enhancement. The lesion extendedinto the T11 neural foramina and abutted the right T11nerve root. There was erosion of the T11 posterior ele-ments, the right lateral portion of the T11 vertebral body,and the proximal portion of the 11th rib. A left-sidedparavertebral mass with similar signal characteristics ex-tended from the inferior aspect of T8 to the superior as-pect of T10, entered the T9 neural foramina, and obliter-ated the T9 nerve root, causing erosion of the posteriorelements of T9 and the inferior portion of the posteriorelements of T8. A cranial MRI examination was normal.The patient was admitted to the hospital.She was a native of a country on the northeasterncoast of Africa and had immigrated to the United Statestwo years before admission. Her general health had al-ways been good except for a bout of hepatitis at the ageof seven years. She did not drink or smoke; her menseswere normal, and she had never been sexually active.There was no history of urinary incontinence or reten-tion, cough, hemoptysis, diarrhea, heart murmur, seriousinfections, receipt of blood products, intravenous drugabuse, exposure to pets, or weakness in the legs.The temperature was 37°C, the pulse was 72, andthe respirations were 16. The blood pressure was110/60 mm Hg.On physical examination the patient appeared well.No rash or lymphadenopathy was found. The head, neck,lungs, heart, and breasts were normal. An abdominalexamination was normal; no tenderness or hepatospleno-megaly was detected. No scoliosis or kyphosis was ob-served; there was tenderness over the vertebral spinesfrom approximately the fifth thoracic to the second lum-bar vertebra and in the right costovertebral angle, withless tenderness on the left side. The extremities were nor-mal. A neurologic examination, including an assessmentof motor power, sensation, and reflexes in the lower ex-tremities, was normal.The urine was normal. The hematocrit was 35.2 per-cent, the white-cell count was 4800 per cubic millime-ter, the platelet count was 352,000 per cubic millimeter,and the mean corpuscular volume was 98 µm³. The val-ues for urea nitrogen, creatinine, conjugated and totalbilirubin, electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, lac-tate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase were nor-mal. A chest film was normal.A diagnostic procedure was performed.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSISDR. HENRY J. MANKIN*: May we review the radio-logic imaging studies?DR. EDWARD B. MARIANACCI: A coned-down view ofthe lower thoracic spine (Fig. 1) shows a destructive le-sion in the proximal right T11 rib. The vertebral bodyappears intact. A CT scan (Fig. 2) through the same lev-el shows an expansion of the proximal portion of theright 11th rib, with bony destruction. Bony destruction isalso evident along the adjacent lateral aspect of the 11thvertebral body, surrounded by an ill-defined soft-tissuemass centered at the costovertebral articulation. An axialimage at the T9 level shows bony destruction along theleft lateral aspect of the vertebral body and the proximalportion of the left ninth rib, with an associated, ill-defined soft-tissue mass. An axial T₁-weighted MRI scan(Fig. 3) through the T11 level shows a soft-tissue massin the region of the proximal right 11th rib that has pre-dominantly the same signal intensity as muscle. A gado-linium-enhanced T₁-weighted image shows heterogene-ous enhancement of the mass, as well as an adjacentarea within the vertebral body. A chest film obtained onadmission was normal.DR. MANKIN: If any laboratory tests for infectiousdiseases had been performed, particularly a tuberculintest, but also blood cultures and blood tests for some ofthe rarer fungal infections, the results would have beenhelpful in the differential diagnosis. I assume that thosetests were not done.The features of this case that are important to con-sider in arriving at the appropriate diagnosis includethe anatomical sites of the lesions, the patient\\'s countryof origin, and the nature of the illness. I shall addresseach in turn.First, there were two lesions in distinct anatomicalsites, both of which arose in the paravertebral space.The lower lesion on the right side had displaced a rib,destroyed its head, and entered the canal through theforamen without causing much damage to the vertebralbody. The lesion on the left side had entered the spinalcanal but had a smaller soft-tissue component. The onlybone disease was in the rib and on the surface of thevertebrae, and it is therefore unlikely that the bone wasthe principal site of the disease. The process probablyarose in the soft tissue, the paravertebral space, or eventhe spinal canal.Second, the patient came from the northeastern coastof Africa, and I assume that she was black. I base thisassumption principally on the history of clitoral circum-cision, which is performed by a number of black African*Chief, Orthopaedic Service, Massachusetts General Hospital; Edith M.

Although gynecologic abnormalities and uri-nary tract and soft-tissue infections have been reportedin association with this practice, none of these disordersare consistent with this patient\\'s presentation.Somalia, Sudan, and Ethiopia are currently consid-ered to be major reservoirs for the acquired immunode-ficiency syndrome (AIDS). In addition, some disordersthat are rarely seen in the United States are prevalent inthese countries, including leishmaniasis, kala-azar, schis-tosomiasis, trypanosomiasis, toxoplasmosis, sporotricho-sis, cryptococcosis, yaws, and bejel.4,5 Few of these dis-eases present as isolated granulomatous abscesses of thespine, however, and I can put them at the bottom of thediagnostic list, although I shall return to one of themduring my final analysis.Third, this patient\\'s illness seems to have been infec-tious and, in view of changes shown on the imaging stud-ies, probably granulomatous. The febrile course, with adaily rise of the temperature to 38°C, and the rapidsedimentation rate support this conclusion. Lymphoma,the only other disease commonly associated with feverof this sort in young adults, is a possible explanation,although the absence of palpable lymph nodes, theabsence of organomegaly on the abdominal ultrasono-graphic study, and the peculiar shape and character ofthe lesions make lymphoma less probable than infection.An even less likely diagnosis is neurofibromatosis, withtwo dumbbell-shaped destructive soft-tissue lesions (bothinside and outside the spinal canal), but this diagnosis isimprobable in the absence of axillary freckling, fibromamolluscum of the skin, or plexiform neurofibromas atother sites. The destruction of the rib makes a neurofi-broma improbable. The patient was too young for meta-static carcinoma, and the presence of two distinct lesionsmakes the diagnosis of a primary malignant bone orsoft-tissue neoplasm unlikely. Having said that, I mustmention that Ewing\\'s sarcoma can be multicentric andcan arise from the ribs and soft tissue of the paraverte-bral space. Two separate foci of Ewing\\'s sarcoma aremuch less likely, however, than two foci of granuloma-tous infection.What kind of infection could this patient have had?It could have been an unusual type indigenous to thenortheastern coast of Africa. Sporotrichosis, cryptococ-cosis, and histoplasmosis are three such infections thatin their disseminated form may produce bone lesions andsoft-tissue abscesses.6,7 The absence of skin lesions, pul-monary abnormalities, hepatomegaly, and a variety ofother changes in the nervous and gastrointestinal sys-tems, however, makes any of these diseases an unlikelycause of this patient\\'s illness.Of the granulomatous processes, the most prevalentworldwide is tuberculosis. This disease has reached ep-idemic proportions in some parts of the world, and athird of the world\\'s population is infected with Mycobac-terium tuberculosis (known as the “Red King”). The formof tuberculosis that affects the musculoskeletal systemin urban populations in this country was until recentlyalmost always secondary disease (reinfection) and prin-cipally involved the joints and the spine. Tuberculousosteomyelitis, soft-tissue abscesses, and miliary diseasein the bone marrow were seen principally in Eskimosand native Americans and have become rare even inthese populations. With the advent of AIDS, however,the Red King has returned to the cities in this country,with not only a wide array of new presentations but alsoresistance to many of the medications that were previ-ously so effective in treating the disease.9-11 The fre-quency of tuberculosis in New York City and San Fran-cisco is increasing rapidly, and these cities are on thebrink of having epidemics.9,10Tuberculosis affecting the spine has a long history inorthopedics and was one of the most common diseasesencountered in the early days of the specialty. At the turnof the century and later, patients with chronic muscu-loskeletal problems associated with tuberculosis, chron-ic osteomyelitis, anterior poliomyelitis, or the sequelaeof acquired or congenital syphilis filled the orthopedicwards, and these diseases caused severe disability. Thetypical presentation of spinal tuberculosis was an initialdestructive lesion in the subchondral region of the bodyof a lumbar segment (or less commonly, a thoracic seg-ment, or even less frequently, a cervical segment) that ex-tended beneath the anterior longitudinal ligament to theadjacent segment, producing a similar lesion in thatbone. This disorder resulted in the characteristic pictureof Pott\\'s disease: subcortical and cortical destruction onboth sides of a narrowed but usually not completely col-lapsed disk space, a juxtaarticular osteopenia, and a soft-tissue (cold) abscess that tracked with the psoas muscle,either along or directly posterior to the ribs. Less com-monly, sufficient granulomatous material and pus ac-cumulated in the epidural space to produce neurologicchanges, a process that became known as “Pott\\'s para-plegia.\" This lesion requires early drainage to preventpermanent damage to the spinal cord, cauda equina, andnerve roots.Since the advent of antituberculous drugs, the fre-quency of these two characteristic presentations of spi-nal disease has declined. Use of antituberculous drugshas also virtually eliminated the severe distortion of thespinal segment occurring late in the course of the dis-order, which often produced a deforming gibbus or se-verely fixed scoliosis and pelvic obliquity in the earlydays, when the Red King predominated among ortho-pedic diseases.The picture in Third World countries was and still isconsiderably different. In the days before effective drugtreatment was available, many patients had the primarydisease, with dissemination to the meninges, peritone-um, bone marrow, skin, and lymph nodes, and they of-ten died of the disease. Tuberculosis remains a serioushealth problem in Africa. In Somalia the rate of positivetuberculin tests is estimated to be 54 percent in persons15 years of age.12 A case report from Toronto describedan Ethiopian man who presented with mild constitution-The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

He was evaluated for lymphoma and ultimate-ly was given the diagnosis of tuberculosis.13 Similarly,although Pott\\'s disease is the characteristic form of spi-nal tuberculosis,14,15 in recent years, particularly amongthe African populations, there have been reports of para-spinal abscesses and skip lesions with little or no effecton the adjacent vertebral bodies.16 Tuberculosis of thespine affecting only the posterior elements and pedicleshas also been described.17In view of the prevalence of tuberculosis in Somaliaand Ethiopia and the recent discovery, particularly withthe use of modern imaging techniques, that tuberculousgranulomas can present as paravertebral or epidural ab-scesses, which can even destroy a rib,18 it is logical to con-clude that this patient had a tuberculous infection. Theprincipal question is whether tuberculosis can cause suchextensive spinal disease without some pulmonary, renal,or gastrointestinal abnormalities or lymphadenopathy.Such a presentation is possible, as the recent case reportby Hanania and Hoffstein indicates,13 but it is unlikelyin view of the typical presentation of reinfection withhematogenous spread to the spine from an active pul-monary focus.Before making an unequivocal diagnosis, I shall dis-cuss one other possible diagnosis: non-Hodgkin\\'s lym-phoma. Primary lymphoma of bone is not uncommon,and the spine and even the ribs are not unusual sites.19,20Multiple foci are the rule. Although nocturnal fever (inthe form of Pel-Ebstein fever) is more characteristic ofHodgkin\\'s disease, it can also occur with non-Hodgkin\\'slymphoma and may be the symptom heralding the dis-order. The sedimentation rate is often elevated in pa-tients with lymphoma; the white-cell count and the restof the studies generally provide little help in making thediagnosis. Although lymphadenopathy and organomeg-aly may be present in such patients, these findings arenot the rule, especially in patients with a primary lym-phoma of bone. The findings in this case could be thoseof lymphoma, probably arising in the 11th rib, with a sec-ond focus in the paravertebral tissues two segments ceph-alad to the presenting site.As for fungal and other disorders possibly related tothe patient\\'s African background, it is improbable thatcryptococcosis or histoplasmosis would cause so muchdestruction and such a well-defined soft-tissue abscesswithout involvement of the lungs, central nervous sys-tem, viscera, and skin and without a much less indolentcourse. Sporotrichosis is a more likely possibility, sinceit is associated with pulmonary or visceral disorders lessoften, and osteomyelitis and central nervous system in-volvement are not uncommon.In the final analysis, then, I must include the possibil-ities of sporotrichosis, non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, andtuberculosis. None of these diagnoses are consistent withall the historical, physical, imaging, and laboratory datain this case, and I am tempted to list lymphoma andsporotrichosis just to learn more about them, but as anorthopedist, I remain drawn to the Red King, which hasso dramatically changed the world and remains a pre-dominant medical problem.

MARK: No family history of tubercu-losis is indicated in the case record.CLINICAL DIAGNOSISParavertebral abscess.DR. HENRY J. MANKIN\\'S DIAGNOSISParavertebral and epidural abscess with Mycobacteri-um tuberculosis.PATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONDR. HORACE C. WU: The diagnostic procedure wasa fine-needle aspiration, which revealed scanty chronicinflammation, epithelioid cells, giant cells, and necroticmaterial (Fig. 4). A Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast or-ganisms was negative on the cell-block preparation. Flu-orescence microscopy with the use of auramine O showedrare acid-fast organisms, however, and cultures of thespecimen were positive for M. tuberculosis, which was sen-sitive to ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifampin,and streptomycin.The infectious agent was identified by a specific meth-od of acid-fast staining that involves the use of a flu-orochrome, such as auramine O, which has a bright-yellow fluorescence. Most investigators believe that thistechnique is more sensitive than bright-field microscopy,which is the more common method of examination. Al-though the equipment for fluorescence microscopy withacid-fast staining is more expensive and requires greaterexpertise to use, many experienced pathologists reportthat it is superior and should be used when possible.It is generally believed that skeletal tuberculosis iscaused by the dissemination of bacilli in the bloodstreamearly in the course of the initial infection.21-24 In some cas-es the infection appears to spread to bone through lym-phatic drainage from another focus of tuberculosis.

In children and probably also in adults, skeletalinvolvement may be the only manifestation of systemicdisease and, like the pulmonary form, may smolder foryears before being recognized.24Although skeletal involvement is present in only about1 percent of cases of tuberculosis, it is the most com-mon site of extrapulmonary disease, accounting for 35percent of such cases.25 In adults tuberculosis of theskeletal system usually occurs in the joints most subjectto trauma. Spinal involvement accounts for approxi-mately half the cases, and involvement of the hip andthe knee accounts for about 15 percent of them.21 Tu-berculosis of bone is more common in elderly patientsthan in those who are younger and is apt to have an un-usual location.The first lumbar vertebra is the most frequently affect-ed.21,24 Although solitary lesions are not uncommon, mul-tiple lesions, ranging in number up to 10, are typical.21,24,26The vertebral body is affected more often than the pos-terior elements, although the latter are initially or pre-dominantly affected in some patients.In most cases, tuberculous spondylitis begins in theanterior portion of the vertebral body adjacent to thesubchondral plate. Enlargement and caseation of the le-sion lead to an identifiable radiographic abnormality intwo to five months.21,25 During this time, infection mayspread to the adjacent intervertebral disks if the bacilliextend beneath the anterior or posterior longitudinalligament and involve the peripheral disk tissue. Thecollapse of partially destroyed vertebral bodies can leadto severe deformities, such as a kyphosis or a gibbousdeformity.21,25,27Tuberculosis frequently extends from the vertebraeand disks to the adjacent ligaments and soft tissue. Theextension is usually anterolateral and only rarely posteri-or in the peridural space.28,29 After infection has been es-tablished in the perispinal tissue, it may remain localizedor extend for a considerable distance. Abscess formationcan produce soft-tissue swelling, which is commonly bi-lateral and fusiform and may contain foci of calcification.With a fine-needle aspiration biopsy, the morpholog-ic and microbiologic diagnosis of vertebral tuberculosiscan be made with confidence, and conservative medicaltreatment should be initiated as early as possible.30-33The hazards of an open biopsy of a malignant tumor,which can mimic tuberculous spondylitis radiographi-cally, are avoided with this procedure. In the hands ofa trained cytopathologist, fine-needle aspiration is nothazardous, and it results in fewer complications and costsless than an open biopsy.30DR.

       " 'A 51-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of the adult respiratory distress syndrome.\\nOne week before admission, he began to have a dry cough, with myalgia and arthralgia. Three days later, he had shaking chills and coughed up yellow sputum. Two days before admission, the cough worsened, with the production of scanty sputum, a high temperature, and more chills. He sat upright because of dyspnea and had severe pain in the upper back. The day before admission to this hospital, he entered another hospital because of worsening dyspnea.\\nThe patient was a businessman. Thirty years earlier he had had sarcoidosis, which was subsequently quiescent. He did not smoke or abuse alcohol. There was a healthy parakeet at home. One of his children had similar influenza-like symptoms. There was no history of recent travel or risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection.\\nThe temperature was 38.5°C, the pulse was 130, and the respirations were 40. The blood pressure was 105/55 mm Hg. Oxygen was administered. Analysis of arterial blood showed that the partial pressure of oxygen was 82 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 62 mm Hg, and the pH was 7.10. After urgent insertion of an endotracheal tube, the blood pressure fell to 65 mm Hg. The patient was transferred to an intensive care unit, where the pulse was 135. Mechanical ventilation was maintained at a rate of 10 breaths per minute. After the administration of low-dose dopamine, the blood pressure was 135/70 mm Hg. Copious, thin secretions were aspirated from the endotracheal tube. Examination at that point revealed diffuse, bilateral rhonchi and a grade 1 systolic murmur. There was no peripheral edema, digital clubbing, or cyanosis.\\nLaboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2).\\nAn electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 130. A radiograph of the chest (Fig. 1) showed asymmetric bilateral air-space disease, involving mainly the upper lobes and the left lower lobe, and calcified hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, some with an eggshell configuration. Microscopical examination of a specimen of sputum showed many gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains and a few neutrophils.\\nA pulmonary arterial catheter was inserted, and vancomycin (1 g) was administered intravenously. The pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was 22 mm Hg, the right ventricular pressure was 40/10 mm Hg, the pulmonary arterial pressure was 31/20 mm Hg, and the right atrial pressure was 9 mm Hg; the cardiac output was 5.2 liters per minute.\\nDuring the day, supraventricular tachycardia developed, followed by asystole. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, including the injection of atropine, restored the supraventricular tachycardia. A second chest radiograph (Fig. 2) revealed progression of the bilateral consolidation. Gentamicin and erythromycin were given intravenously. Severe oliguria developed. The patient was transferred to this hospital.\\nOn his arrival, no pulse or blood pressure was detectable through an arterial catheter. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was resumed successfully, with the administration of norepinephrine, dopamine, phenylephrine, and sodium bicarbonate (7 ampules), among other agents. Analysis of arterial blood showed that the partial pressure of oxygen was 69 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 46 mm Hg, and the pH was 6.99. The temperature was 38.7°C, the pulse was 124, and the blood pressure was 80/32 mm Hg.\\nThe pupils were widely dilated and unresponsive to light; the corneal reflexes were absent. A Swan-Ganz catheter was present in the right internal jugular vein. Minimal air movement was audible on auscultation; after the aspiration of large quantities of yellow-tan sputum streaked with blood and the administration of albuterol, diffuse inspiratory rhonchi and expiratory wheezes were heard. The heart sounds were obscured by respiratory noises. The abdomen was distended but soft, and bowel sounds were absent. The arms and legs were mottled, with cool, cyanotic hands and feet.\\nThe urine had a specific gravity of 1.025, with a pH of 5.0, and was positive (++) for protein and glucose; the sediment contained (per low-power field) 35 granular casts, 30 white cells, 35 red cells, and many bacteria. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). An electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia at a rate of 120, with complete right bundle-branch block. A radiograph of the chest showed further progression of the bilateral air-space disease.\\nThe patient received 100 percent oxygen and was given vancomycin, erythromycin, doxycycline, tromethamine (an experimental buffer that penetrates the intracellular space), and dichloroacetate. He continued to have severe oliguria. Inhaled nitric oxide (20 and 40 parts per million) had no effect on pulmonary arterial pressure or oxygenation. Toward midnight, the partial pressure of oxygen dropped from 93 to 50 mm Hg; the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 46 mm Hg, the pH was 7.42, and the blood pressure was 82/48 mm Hg.\\nEarly on the second hospital day, hypotension worsened despite maximal doses of pressor medications and additional sodium bicarbonate. Ventricular tachycardia developed, with a loss of blood pressure. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed. Another radiograph of the chest revealed progression of the air-space disease.\\nThe patient was pronounced dead.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. JOHN L. BRUSCH*: May we review the radiologic findings?\\nDR. JO-ANNE O. Shepard: The initial chest radiograph (Fig. 1) from the other hospital shows bilateral pulmonary consolidation, which is most marked in the left lower lobe. Films obtained six hours later (Fig. 2) and nine hours later show marked progression of the consolidation.\\nDR. BRUSCH: One of a physician\\'s greatest challenges is the treatment of a patient with a rapidly deteriorating condition of uncertain cause. The clinical presentation of this patient reminds us that such a condition can occur in apparently normal persons as well as immunocompromised hosts.\\nThe patient under discussion died with failure of multiple organ systems that was apparently triggered by an unknown pulmonary insult. The causes of such a syndrome range from vasculitis to a wide variety of infections.¹ Although he had had sarcoidosis, his pulmonary symptoms were inconsistent with that disease, which would be unlikely to flare up after such a long interval. He did not have hemoptysis; red-cell casts, which would suggest glomerulonephritis; or any of the skin lesions associated with vasculitis. I believe that he died from complications of a community-acquired pneumonia, the sixth most frequent cause of death and the most common infectious cause in the United States. 4,5 Diagnosing pneumonia is easy, but the determination of its cause can be very difficult. Fang et al.6 have proposed guidelines for determining the cause of pneumonia (Table 3).\\nThe growth of a single pathogen from the sputum does not constitute a definitive diagnosis of the cause of infection. Sputum cultures have been negative in up to 50 percent of patients with bacterial pneumonia, even when large numbers of the causative organisms were seen on Gram\\'s staining.\" The sensitivity of the Gram\\'s stain of sputum in patients with community-acquired pneumonia ranges from 60 to 85 percent when there are more than 25 leukocytes and fewer than 10 epithelial cells per low-power field. Even with aggressive diagnostic techniques, the cause of community-acquired pneumonia is not identified in 43 percent of the cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae causes 60 percent of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae 15 percent, 10 Legionella pneumophila 10 to 15 percent, and Staphylococcus aureus 2 to 10 percent.11 Strep. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila are the most common causes of life-threatening, community-acquired pneumonia.12\\nBecause of the diagnostic shortcomings of laboratory tests, it is important to characterize a case of community-acquired pneumonia as completely as possible. First, is the clinical presentation that of a typical or an atypical lung infection? Typical pneumonia, which is due to pyogenic organisms that are part of the normal flora of the upper respiratory tract, presents with the sudden onset of fever, chills, and purulent sputum, with a localized pulmonary infiltrate that is demonstrable on radiograph. The term \"atypical\" was first used to describe the unusual clinical manifestations of pulmonary infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The definition has since been greatly expanded. Atypical pneumonia is caused by the inhalation of organisms that reside in the environment, not in the oropharynx. These pathogens are not usually detected on Gram\\'s staining. An influenza-like prodrome is common, and systemic symptoms often temporarily overshadow those of the respiratory tract infection.4\\nBecause of the rapid progression of symptoms, patients with typical pneumonia seek medical help after a mean of 6 days of illness, 12 but with the slow evolution of atypical pneumonia, the average interval is 10 days. The clinical distinctions between typical and atypical pneumonia are often blurred, however, especially in elderly and disabled patients. Attention to the clinical condition of the patient at the time that the infection is acquired, the immune system, and the pulmonary radiographic findings often helps the clinician determine the cause of community-acquired pneumonia.\\nThe patient under discussion did not have any of the factors that often confer a predisposition to the development of community-acquired pneumonia (e.g., a seizure disorder, alcoholism, smoking, or an immunosuppressed state). The onset of his illness with a dry cough, myalgia, and arthralgia but without symptoms involving the lower respiratory tract is characteristic of an atypical pneumonia.\\nM. pneumoniae infection usually occurs in persons under 40 years of age.13 Sore throat and hoarseness are prominent early symptoms. The pneumonia is rarely life-threatening. Chlamydia pneumoniae accounts for 6 to 12 percent of cases of community-acquired pneumonia.14 The infection is transmitted from person to person. In most of the cases, the illness is mild. The manifestations resemble those of M. pneumoniae infection, with frequent upper respiratory tract symptoms, but the course of C. pneumoniae infection is often more prolonged and severe, especially in elderly patients. Other causes of atypical pneumonia, such as Q fever and tularemia, are unlikely in this case because of the absence of the characteristic epidemiologic factors. 15,16\\nWe do not know whether this patient\\'s illness occurred during the influenza season. The viruses most commonly associated with atypical pneumonia in adults are influenzavirus A and B, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus.17 Two types of pneumonia are associated with influenza. The primary form affects patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, involves the lungs directly, occurs shortly after the initial manifestations of influenza, and has radiographic features that resemble those of the adult respiratory distress syndrome. The secondary bacterial pneumonitis associated with influenza starts as the patient is recovering from the viral infection. Hantavirus infection presents with a prodrome of fever, severe myalgia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea18 and can cause severe pulmonary dysfunction within a few days. This patient had no history of travel to the Southwest, but the disease has been reported elsewhere in the United States.\\nThe presence of the parakeet in the patient\\'s household compels me to examine the possibility that psittacosis caused this fatal pneumonia.19 Fewer than 200 cases of this infection are reported annually in the United States. C. psittaci is transmitted by the respiratory route from the aerosolized urine and feces of any avian species. Only brief contact is required for effective transmission. Because the bird in this case was healthy, it is unlikely that it discharged a large number of organisms into the environment, and any exposure should be considered minor. In addition, the patient did not have the nonrespiratory manifestations of psittacosis, such as Horder\\'s spots (lesions that resemble rose spots), epistaxis, splenomegaly, or thrombophlebitis in the legs.\\nWhenever an atypical pneumonia appears to be life-threatening, the diagnosis of legionnaires\\' disease must be pursued vigorously. Legionnaires\\' disease cannot be differentiated from pyogenic typical pneumonia, such as pneumococcal pneumonia, on the basis of the clinical presentation, the results of nonspecific laboratory tests, or the pulmonary radiographic abnormalities.20-22 Scanty or nonpurulent secretions are considered characteristic of legionnaires\\' disease, but the sputum is purulent in 20 to 74 percent of the cases. A wide variety of pulmonary radiographic changes have been described. The change most characteristic of legionnaires\\' disease is the rapid, asymmetric progression of the infiltrate, not its specific appearance. Although the Gram\\'s stain is typically negative, concurrent infection with other organisms occurs in 5 to 10 percent of patients with community-acquired legionnaires\\' disease. 23,24\\nSevere pleuritic pain is present in 20 percent of cases of legionnaires\\' disease. In the patient under discussion, pulmonary emboli were suspected. The abnormalities on liver-function tests are more severe and renal failure, diarrhea, and neurologic defects are more common in legionnaires\\' disease than in other types of pneumonia. Recent data indicate that sporadic cases of community-acquired legionnaires\\' disease can be linked to hot-water tanks contaminated with L. pneumophila, which has been retrieved from 1 to 30 percent of home hot-water tanks.19\\nThe influenza-like symptoms in this patient\\'s child are not diagnostically helpful. Certain atypical pneumonias are transmitted from person to person, but legionnaires\\' disease is not. The severe pain in the patient\\'s upper back may have reflected pleuritic involvement or, although this is very unlikely, a pulmonary embolus, or it may have been caused by heavy coughing. The development of orthopnea may have indicated the onset of congestive heart failure, but the dyspnea associated with various lung diseases may be relieved in the upright position because of the resultant improvement in the ventilation-perfusion ratio and the facilitation of diaphragmatic movement.\\nOn admission to the other hospital, the patient was hypotensive and febrile. Blood gas studies showed hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and acidosis, probably a respiratory acidosis with a metabolic component. The drop in the blood pressure on intubation was presumably due to a vasovagal effect in a patient undergoing emergency intubation, since the blood pressure was normal during treatment with low doses of dopamine.\\nAt this point, the chief clinical factors to be addressed are the causes of the patient\\'s respiratory failure and the mixed acidosis. The absence of clubbing is evidence against chronic pulmonary disease. The thinness of the patient\\'s secretions is consistent with an atypical pneumonia; their large quantity suggests concurrent congestive heart failure. Diffuse bilateral rhonchi, without any signs of consolidation, are often audible in cases of atypical pneumonia.\\nLeukopenia is frequently seen in patients with severe infection. The presence of many gram-positive cocci and few neutrophils in the patient\\'s sputum must be taken into account in the diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making process, since no other microbiologic data are presented. A positive Gram\\'s stain calls into question the diagnosis of atypical pneumonia. With few white cells present, however, the sample may have been contaminated by the oropharyngeal flora or may reflect superinfection or a concurrent bacterial pathogen. The hypoxia and hypercapnia were clearly related to the extensive bilateral air-space disease.\\nThe findings of the catheterization study indicate that congestive heart failure had been superimposed on the initial pulmonary infection. In view of the absence of risk factors for cardiac disease, the normal size of the heart in the radiogram, and the normal electrocardiogram, congestive heart failure is an unexpected finding, and its presence emphasizes the need for invasive cardiac monitoring in a patient with worsening pneumonia. Congestive heart failure can mimic many of the signs of the adult respiratory distress syndrome. In a 51-year-old man, silent coronary artery disease is a consideration. Fluid overload is a common result of a vigorous resuscitative effort and may worsen the primary lung problem, as indicated by both the blood gas values and the films of the chest. The possibility of cardiac involvement with an underlying infiltrative disease, such as sarcoidosis, must also be considered.\\nI shall assume that the patient\\'s renal failure was part of the acute illness. That glomerulonephritis can be due to severe visceral infection is well established. 25 Glomerulonephritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, or acute tubular necrosis due to hypotension may occur in patients with legionella infection. 26\\nIn this case, the dysfunction of three major organ systems leads us to a consideration of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which is caused by the unchecked hypermetabolic response to a variety of insults, including infections, drug reactions, pancreatitis, trauma, and prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The diagnosis depends on the presence of two or more of the features listed in Table 4.27\\nThe term \"sepsis\" refers to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome caused by an infection. The lungs are the most commonly affected organ system. 28 Another major mediator in the pathogenesis of sepsis is the myocardial depressant substance,29 which decreases the cardiac output to a level that is inadequate to meet the increased peripheral oxygen demands of sepsis. In addition, the agents of atypical pneumonia, including L. pneumophila, can cause myocarditis.30\\nMeasures of an organ\\'s performance that appear to be normal or almost normal in patients with sepsis can be misleading. In view of this patient\\'s blood pressure and overall condition, a cardiac output of 10 liters per minute would have been much more appropriate than the reported output of 5.2 liters. Because of the presence of congestive heart failure, it is impossible to state definitely that he had any of the pulmonary changes characteristic of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. However, approximately 40 percent of patients with sepsis have pulmonary involvement. This patient did not live long enough for the illness to progress to the advanced stages, such as the adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.\\nThe longer he was in cardiac failure, the greater the chance that the consequences of a low-flow state would develop, such as ischemic hepatitis (shock liver), as well as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to the increased movement of bacteria from the intestinal tract. The therapeutic goal is to achieve the lowest possible wedge pressure that will support adequate peripheral perfusion and limit the flow of fluid into the alveoli and thus lessen the need for positive end-expiratory pressure, with all its deleterious effects. Erythromycin is the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of atypical pneumonia, except for that caused by psittacosis or Q fever. In severely ill patients with legionnaires\\' disease, many physicians advocate the addition of rifampin. Although antibiotics that act on the cell wall, such as vancomycin, have no effect on the agents of atypical pneumonia, they are useful against the pathogens represented by the gram-positive cocci that were seen in this patient\\'s sputum.\\nThis patient\\'s supraventricular tachycardia may have been due to congestive heart failure. The response of the asystole to atropine, however, suggests an underlying abnormality of the patient\\'s electric conduction system, which may have been caused by myocarditis 4,31 or sarcoidosis, although these disorders are associated with clinical signs of cardiac involvement in only 5 percent of patients. Cardiac granulomas and fibrosis, however, which are found in 35 to 40 percent of patients at autopsy, 32 can result in heart block, congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death. Sarcoidosis can cause a restrictive, as well as a rapidly progressive, congestive cardiomyopathy. Extensive scarring at the head of the ventricular septum can explain the severe conduction abnormalities as well as the malignant arrhythmias associated with this disease. The diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis must be considered in any patient with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and electrocardiographic or clinical signs of heart disease without evidence of coronary artery disease.\\nAmong patients with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and dysfunction of one organ, the mortality rate is 30 to 40 percent; the involvement of two organs raises the rate to 60 percent, and the syndrome is fatal in more than 90 percent of patients in whom three organs are involved.32 In patients with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and associated lung injury severe enough to require mechanical ventilation, the fate of the other organ systems determines survival. Ten percent of early deaths and 18 percent of late deaths in such patients are due to respiratory failure. Most deaths are caused by hemodynamic problems or progressive renal failure or both. Death occurs most frequently between two and three weeks after the initial insult.33\\nAfter this patient was resuscitated, he had extreme acidosis, with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide close to the normal value. The acidosis was metabolic, reflecting markedly decreased peripheral perfusion, aggravated by the vasoconstrictive medications used to support his blood pressure. By the time acidosis developed, he was in irreversible shock. His coma was due chiefly to anoxia and hypotension. Sepsis often affects the central nervous system,34 with manifestations ranging from mild changes in the sensorium to coma (in 12 percent of the cases) in association with an acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis. 35 The patient\\'s disseminated intravascular coagulation was an ominous sign.36 The rapidly progressive pulmonary infiltrates probably reflected worsening congestive heart failure. The markedly abnormal results of liver-function tests are more consistent with shock liver than with the organ abnormalities of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome.\\nI believe that legionella is the most likely pathogen in this case because of its role in producing life-threatening atypical respiratory infections, and because of the rapid pulmonary progression of such infections and their association with severe pleuritic pain. Other agents of atypical pneumonia, as well as pneumococci and other pyogenic organisms, can produce the same clinical picture. 10,11 There may well have been an underlying conduction abnormality due to sarcoid involvement of the heart. The immediate cause of death was congestive heart failure and instability of the conducting system produced by the myocardial depressant substance associated with sepsis, bacterial myocarditis, and fibrosis of the myocardium and conducting system.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nBacterial pneumonia with sepsis.\\n\\nDR. JOHN L. BRUSCH\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nAtypical pneumonia, probably legionnaires\\' disease. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema, with conduction abnormalities due to myocarditis, myocardial depressant substance, and cardiomyopathy associated with sarcoidosis.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: At autopsy, a liter of serosanguineous fluid was found in each hemithorax. Each lung was twice the normal weight and showed both lobar (Fig. 3) and nodular (Fig. 4) consolidation. On microscopical examination, the pneumonia was found to be unusual because of the relatively few neutrophils within the alveolar fluid and the presence of fibrin (Fig. 5), possibly reflecting the rapid progression of the infection and the low white-cell count. Paucicellular pneumonia typically occurs in patients with fulminant bacterial infections such as plague, anthrax, and tularemia. In this case gram-positive cocci swarmed in the alveoli, particularly along the alveolar walls (Fig. 6). Group A B-hemolytic streptococcus grew from postmortem cultures of lung and blood specimens. Microabscesses had developed in areas of lobar pneumonia. Capillary thrombosis and necrosis near hemorrhagic microabscesses in the lung, hemorrhagic necrosis in a mesenteric lymph node, petechiae in many organs, and extensive cutaneous ecchymoses reflected terminal sepsis and coagulopathy with fibrin split products. Pulmonary-capillary thrombosis has been reported previously in patients with septicemia due to gram-positive bacteria.37\\nThe pulmonary changes were not those typical of diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes, which is found in most cases of the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Enlarged, hyalinized, hilar lymph nodes contained many compact granulomas indicative of sarcoidosis. Occasional granulomas were found in the lung, mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleen. Small granulomas and focal scars disrupted the elastica of the pulmonary arteries (Fig. 7), a characteristic finding in sarcoidosis.38 Marked peribronchial scarring, which probably resulted from sarcoidosis, had caused bronchiectasis and probably predisposed the patient to pneumonia, although fatal pneumonia complicating sarcoidal bronchiectasis was not reported in a recent study of the causes of death in 38 cases of sarcoidosis. 39 The heart contained a small fibrous scar in the septum but no granulomas or myocarditis.\\nStreptococcal pneumonia accounted for 2 to 5 percent of all lobar or lobular pneumonias before the antibiotic era. 40 In 1968, when antibiotics were available, acute streptococcal pneumonia was reported in 95 young military recruits without preexisting disease, none of whom died.41 Empyema occurred in 57 percent of the patients, reflecting the high incidence of pleural effusion in pneumonia due to streptococcus, as compared with pneumonia caused by other bacteria.40 Other complications were rare. Two percent of the patients had positive blood cultures.\\nDR. BIMAL P. JAIN: One factor in the fatal outcome may have been the patient\\'s delay in seeking medical evaluation and the resultant delay in antibiotic therapy.\\nDR. BRUSCH: I should have placed more emphasis on the positive Gram\\'s stain, but the paucity of white cells calls into question the validity of the sputum sample. However, it provides the only direct evidence of the pathogen. The findings on Gram\\'s staining dictate the administration of antimicrobial agents effective against a wide range of gram-positive pathogens. Normal hosts may die of pneumococcal disease despite the best therapy. This is a typical case of a pyogenic infection due to group A B-hemolytic streptococcus presenting as an atypical pneumonia.\\nDR. MARK: Despite the use of antibiotics, the overall mortality rate among patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia who require admission to the hospital is 30 percent or more.41-43',\n",
       " 'A 48-year-old man with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was admitted to the hospital because of bloody diarrhea and severe abdominal pain.\\nTwo years earlier, the patient had been found to have advanced AIDS and cytomegalovirus retinitis of the left eye. During the next two years, his CD4+ cell count was less than 10 per cubic millimeter, and he received ganciclovir as prophylaxis for the right eye. He had had diarrhea for many years; repeated stool examinations during the two years before admission yielded no diagnosis. Fatigue and intermittent fever were present for six months before admission. Repeated studies failed to detect Mycobacterium avium complex. The patient also had candida esophagitis. During the month before admission, an illness characterized by high fever, rigors, and pneumonia responded to treatment for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, although the microorganism could not be detected on repeated sputum examinations, and a similar subsequent illness responded to treatment for Escherichia coli infection, which was believed to be due to aspiration. A buffy-coat specimen was positive for cytomegalovirus antigen (60 white cells per 150,000). When foscarnet was substituted for ganciclovir, the patient\\'s condition improved. During the second illness, studies of stool specimens showed no white cells, acidfast bacilli or other pathogenic microorganisms, or Clostridium difficile toxin.\\nTwelve days before admission, the patient had urinary frequency. The urinary sediment contained 13 red cells per high-power field. The serum creatinine concentration was 1.0 mg per deciliter (88 µmol per liter). A urine specimen obtained three days later was negative for protein; the sediment contained innumerable red cells per high-power field. On the following day, foscarnet was discontinued. The temperature rose to 39.4°C. The diarrhea worsened, with hematochezia, abdominal distention, and nearly constant abdominal pain.\\nSix days before admission, minimal distention of the lower abdomen was noted. A rectal examination was normal; a stool specimen could not be obtained. The creatinine concentration was 3.1 mg per deciliter (270 µmol per liter). The patient was unable to void for urinalysis. The white-cell count was 19,400 per cubic millimeter. A blood test for cytomegalovirus antigen was positive (18 white cells per 150,000). Films of the abdomen showed a markedly dilated, featureless loop of bowel in the midabdomen, which was believed to be the transverse colon. A few air-fluid levels were present; no intraperitoneal air was seen. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen (Fig. 1), obtained after the oral administration of contrast material, revealed diffuse thickening of the colon, with inflammation of the adjacent mesenteric fat. The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appeared normal. The lung bases were clear. Catheterization of the bladder yielded scanty urine. Fluids were administered intravenously, enabling the patient to void. A stool specimen contained white and red cells. A culture yielded no pathogenic microorganisms. A test for C. difficile toxin was positive. Metronidazole was administered orally.\\nFour days before admission, the abdomen was distended, with rebound tenderness. The patient refused to be admitted to the hospital and received fluids intravenously at home. On the next day, he entered the hospital for total parenteral nutrition, with the infusion of lipids.\\nThe temperature was 36.3°C, and the blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg.\\nThe abdomen was distended and tender, with rebound tenderness and faint bowel sounds. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). A blood test for cytomegalovirus antigen was positive (27 white cells per 150,000). A radiograph of the chest showed bibasilar atelectasis and low lung volumes. Radiographs of the abdomen showed that the colon was slightly dilated, without evidence of bowel obstruction or intraperitoneal air.\\nTotal parenteral nutrition was started, and 2 units of packed red cells were administered. The patient, whose condition was unimproved, was discharged on the second hospital day to continue total parenteral nutrition at home. The diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps continued. One day after discharge, vancomycin was substituted for metronidazole. The patient passed increasing numbers of voluminous, watery stools that contained gross blood. He returned to the hospital.\\nThe patient lived with another man in a monogamous homosexual relationship of 12 years\\' duration. He was allergic to amoxicillin. His medications at the time of admission were trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, nystatin, clotrimazole troches, and fluconazole.\\nThe temperature was 37.1°C, the pulse was 108, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 135/70 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was thin and sweaty. No rash or lymphadenopathy was found. The head and neck were normal, except for a blind left eye. The heart and lungs were also normal. The abdomen was moderately distended and tympanitic, with diffuse, mild tenderness but no guarding. The liver and spleen were not felt. The rectal examination revealed a coarsened mucosa without masses or tenderness. The neurologic examination was normal.\\nThe prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times were normal. The results of other laboratory tests are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Radiographs of the chest showed streaks of atelectasis at the base of the left lung and minimal blunting of the costophrenic angles bilaterally; the remaining lung fields were clear, and the heart appeared normal. A central venous catheter terminated in the superior vena cava. Radiographs of the abdomen (Fig. 2) revealed minimally dilated loops of small bowel in the left upper quadrant that contained air-fluid levels. There was nodular thickening of the bowel wall in several loops of ascending and transverse colon, without dilatation of the bowel. There was no evidence of small-bowel obstruction or free intraperitoneal air.\\nOral intake was withheld except for medications. Metronidazole, cefotetan, foscarnet, and total parenteral nutrition were administered intravenously. Transfusions of packed red cells and platelets were given. During the next three days, the patient continued to experience abdominal pain and pass frequent watery stools that consisted mainly of dark blood. On the second hospital day, the temperature rose to 39.2°C and subsequently reached 38.1°C. Repeated examinations revealed persistent mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness, with moderate tenderness in the left lower quadrant. The hematocrit ranged between 24.5 and 35.5 percent, and the platelet count ranged from 41,000 to 56,000 per cubic millimeter, with daily transfusions of packed red cells and platelets. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times remained normal. The urea nitrogen concentration fell to 16 mg per deciliter (5.7 mmol per liter), and the lactate dehydrogenase concentration rose to 236 U per liter. Radiographs of the abdomen continued to show nodular thickening of the colonic wall. Blood cultures remained sterile, and stool cultures yielded no pathogenic microorganisms.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. DAVID V. IVES*: This 48-year-old man with advanced AIDS presented with a high fever, severe abdominal pain, and hematochezia. May we review the radiologic studies?\\nDR. KEE Y. CHUNG: A plain film of the abdomen obtained six days before admission shows a markedly dilated, featureless loop of bowel in the midabdomen, which is probably the transverse colon. There are scattered air-fluid levels but no evidence of small-bowel obstruction or free intraperitoneal air. A CT scan of the abdomen obtained at the same time (Fig. 1), after the oral administration of contrast material, shows diffuse thickening of the entire colon, with inflammatory signs in adjacent mesenteric fat. Several retroperitoneal lymph nodes are not large enough to meet the criteria for a pathologic process.\\nPlain films of the abdomen obtained on admission (Fig. 2) with the patient supine and upright show several segments of the ascending and transverse colon with nodular wall thickening. No small-bowel dilatation or intraperitoneal free air is seen.\\nDR. IVES: This patient was admitted to the hospital with advanced AIDS. The differential diagnosis in any such patient, regardless of the presenting problem, is long because of the degree of immunosuppression, exposure to nosocomial microorganisms, and general debilitation.\\nWhat diagnoses or combination of diagnoses can explain this man\\'s life-threatening hematochezia? At least two cytomegalovirus colitis (which is related to HIV infection or other causes of immunocompromise) and C. difficile colitis (which is of nosocomial origin) could explain much of his presentation. This would be a severe and hemorrhagic presentation of cytomegalovirus colitis, however, and the C. difficile colitis was responding to appropriate antibiotic therapy, with a partial resolution of the toxin-mediated elevation in the white-cell count. Were other processes also involved?\\nI shall first dispense with several well-known causes of hematochezia that are unlikely to have been involved in this case. Ischemic colitis may present with abdominal pain and hematochezia. Patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may have a severe cardiomyopathy resulting in a low-output state. This patient\\'s heart appeared normal in size on radiographs, however, and there is no other evidence of congestive heart failure or widespread vascular disease.¹ Colon cancer presents with bloody diarrhea in rare cases, but I shall dismiss this diagnosis for lack of further evidence. Other causes of rapid gastrointestinal bleeding, such as esophageal varices, a Mallory-Weiss tear, an arteriovenous malformation, diverticulitis, and a dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm, are not consistent with the history, the colitic nature of the symptoms, or the radiologic findings. Severe inflammatory bowel disease may present with life-threatening hemorrhage, but inflammatory bowel disease appears to be less frequent in HIV-infected patients than in HIV-negative persons, and there are conflicting reports about its improvement as the CD4+ count falls. Given the patient\\'s severe immunodeficiency, I shall discard this diagnosis.\\nTwo malignant tumors deserve special comment because of their markedly increased frequency in patients with HIV infection and because either could have been present in this case. Non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma may present as an abdominal mass, leading to pain, obstruction, and even bowel perforation. However, the absence of a more discrete mass and the diffuse colonic involvement seen on the CT scan are both evidence against that diagnosis. Kaposi\\'s sarcoma usually presents as cutaneous lesions but may present only in the gut. Although Kaposi\\'s sarcoma can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, it is relatively uncommon, and in most cases of life-threatening bleeding, the source is upper gastrointestinal tract lesions.5 I cannot rule out this diagnosis, but it is unlikely that this patient presented with an isolated gastrointestinal Kaposi\\'s sarcoma causing a life-threatening hemorrhage.\\nAmong the possible infectious causes of colitis with diarrhea are viruses, bacteria (including mycobacteria), fungi, and parasites. Of the viruses, cytomegalovirus is the most likely. It has been implicated as a cause of ulcerative lesions in almost every part of the gastrointestinal tract. 6-8 Cytomegalovirus infection with active replication in the gastrointestinal tract induces a vasculitis that interferes with blood flow to the affected mucosa and results in a cycle of necrosis and inflammation, with further vasculitis and tissue compromise. Cytomegalovirus colitis usually presents as persistent diarrhea with abdominal pain. On gross pathological examination, the mucosal surface of infected organs is often inflamed and necrotic, with active ulceration. The diarrhea is often inflammatory, but this feature is not characteristic enough to be diagnostic. Presentations of severe disease, including obstruction and perforation, have been reported. 10,11 Severe hemorrhagic cytomegalovirus colitis requiring surgical intervention or leading to death has been reported in patients with AIDS12,13 and recipients of solid-organ transplants,14 as well as in one patient treated with high-dose corticosteroids for Wegener\\'s granulomatosis. 15\\nIn this case, the history of cytomegalovirus retinitis and the positive test for cytomegalovirus put the patient at very high risk for the development of gastrointestinal cytomegalovirus disease. The administration of ganciclovir since the cytomegalovirus retinitis was diagnosed would not necessarily protect him from either retinitis or gastrointestinal cytomegalovirus disease, since viral resistance to ganciclovir increases with the duration of therapy. 16,17 The suggestion of an initial improvement in the patient\\'s condition with the substitution of foscarnet for ganciclovir may be a further indication of active cytomegalovirus infection.18\\nAnother member of the herpesvirus family, herpes simplex virus, may also cause proctitis and colitis, but the degree of hemorrhage seen in this case is very rare. 19,20 Adenovirus has recently been reported as a possible cause of diarrhea in men with HIV infection, but the diarrhea is generally not hemorrhagic. 21 However, one case of fatal colonic hemorrhage in a patient with both Epstein-Barr virus and adenovirus infection has been reported.22\\nMany bacterial pathogens, including salmonella, shigella, 23 yersinia, E. coli (particularly the O157:H7 serotype), 24 aeromonas, 25 brucella, and campylobacter, cause bloody diarrhea and, in rare cases, life-threatening hematochezia. There is little evidence in the case record, however, to suggest exposure to any of these pathogens, and except for brucella, it is unlikely that they would have escaped diagnosis in the microbiology laboratory. The venereal pathogens that may cause proctitis - specifically, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and Treponema pallidum are not associated with severe hemorrhage or suggested by the patient\\'s recent history. It is interesting to speculate whether bacillary angiomatosis caused by rochalimaea will ever be identified as a cause of severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage.\\nThe most common cause of mycobacterial diarrhea in HIV-infected patients in the United States is M. avium complex. Tuberculosis presents with diarrhea more commonly in underdeveloped countries. The diarrhea caused by M. avium complex is usually watery. The absence of abdominal lymphadenopathy on the CT scan or elevated alkaline phosphatase or aminotransferase levels is also evidence against disseminated infection with M. avium complex.\\nPseudomembranous colitis caused by C. difficile toxin could explain most, if not all, of the findings in this case. At least three events must occur for C. difficile to result in colitis: alteration of the normal bowel flora (usually by broad-spectrum antibiotics with activity against anaerobes), colonization of the gut by C. difficile (usually as a result of nosocomial transmission), and growth of C. difficile with elaboration of its two toxins. The colonic mucosal involvement has three stages: epithelial necrosis and inflammatory exudation;“summit\" lesions, with the exudate appearing to erupt from the site of epithelial necrosis; and diffuse type 2 lesions with overlying pseudomembranes composed of exudate and cellular debris. 25\\nThis patient had received antibiotics for two episodes of pneumonia. C. difficile colitis has been reported in patients with HIV infection when the only antibiotic used was trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole given once daily as prophylaxis against pneumocystis pneumonia. 26 Colonization of the bowel with C. difficile may have occurred during a previous hospital admission or by contact with a long-term-care facility, although this possible source of exposure to the organism is not mentioned in the history. C. difficile toxin was documented in the patient\\'s stool several days before this admission, and he had a white-cell count of over 19,000 per cubic millimeter, a toxin-mediated finding. A white-cell count of 19,000 per cubic millimeter in a patient with advanced HIV disease is just as unusual as a count of over 50,000 per cubic millimeter in an immunocompetent adult with severe C. difficile diarrhea.27 C. difficile colitis may cause acute megacolon and perforation, as well as life-threatening diarrhea.28,29 The response of C. difficile colitis to either metronidazole or oral vancomycin may be delayed by the continued administration of broadspectrum antibiotics for other infections or a bacteremia that results from the initial colitis. 25\\nAmong parasites, only Entamoeba histolytica is a common cause of bloody diarrhea, whereas the other HIVassociated pathogens — cryptosporidium, microsporidium, and isospora - generally cause a watery diarrhea. If this patient had a very severe amebic dysentery, the diagnosis would easily have been made on the basis of routine stool studies. Although strongyloides and schistosoma have been reported to cause severe colitis, there is no epidemiologic evidence of exposure to either parasite in the patient\\'s history. Toxoplasma colitis has been reported as a complication of HIV infection, but there is little evidence of disseminated toxoplasmosis (specifically, pulmonary, cardiac, or bone marrow involvement) in this patient.30 Fungal pathogens reported to cause gastrointestinal ulcerative disease include Histoplasma capsulatum and the agent for South American blastomycosis. 31,32 There is no suggestion of exposure to either organism in the patient\\'s history.\\nDuring the three days in the hospital, the patient continued to bleed rapidly from his gastrointestinal tract, requiring transfusions of both packed red cells and platelets, despite appropriate antibiotic therapy for both cytomegalovirus infection and C. difficile colitis. The failure of this therapy does not rule out these diagnoses, in view of the difficulty in treating either disease in a chronically debilitated, severely immunosuppressed patient.\\nI suspect that the diagnostic procedure was a subtotal colectomy and that pathological examination showed evidence of both severe cytomegalovirus colitis and pseudomembranous colitis caused by C. difficile infection. Although I would not be surprised to find a third or even a fourth diagnosis, I doubt that any other pathogen would have contributed substantially to this patient\\'s severe hematochezia.\\nDR. ROBERT E. SCULLY: Dr. Basgoz, what were your impressions at the time of the diagnostic procedure?\\nDR. NESLI BASGOZ: When the Infectious Disease Service saw this patient, our thoughts were very much along the lines of those expressed by Dr. Ives.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nColitis due to cytomegalovirus and Clostridium difficile infections.\\nDR. DAVID V. IVES\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nCytomegalovirus colitis, severe.\\nPseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile infection.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. R. NEAL SMITH: The diagnostic and therapeutic procedure was an emergent ileocolectomy for uncontrolled bleeding.\\nThe specimen included 100 cm of colon and 2 cm of ileum. The lumen was dilated up to 13 cm in diameter and contained 200 ml of blood and necrotic tissue. In areas of maximal dilatation near the splenic flexure, the wall was only 3 mm thick. The mucosal surface was covered with confluent plaques of soft yellow-to-green, focally hemorrhagic tissue, 1 to 5 mm thick, forming a pseudomembrane (Fig. 3). The ileum appeared normal.\\nMicroscopical examination of the mucosa showed surface epithelial necrosis, with neutrophils in the glandular lumens and the lamina propria. Necrotic epithelium and fibrin coalesced to form plaques and patches that were weakly adherent to the mucosa and formed a pseudomembrane - findings consistent with C. difficile infection (Fig. 4). Acid-fast bacilli, fungi, and pneumocystis were not identified.\\nIn addition, atypical cells with large eosinophilic nuclear inclusions diagnostic of cytomegalovirus infection were readily identified, particularly in capillary endothelial cells (Fig. 5). The diagnosis of cytomegalovirus infection was confirmed by immunohistochemical examination, which revealed infection of endothelial cells in many capillaries in the lamina propria (Fig. 6) and in some epithelial cells. Since cytomegalovirus colitis can result in ulceration with pseudomembrane formation, the extensive pseudomembrane in this case could also be ascribed to cytomegalovirus colitis.33 Five small lymph nodes had atrophic germinal centers a finding consistent with AIDS.\\nA microbiologic examination of the luminal contents showed no ova, parasites, or enteric pathogens, including hemorrhagic E. coli H7:O157, with normal enteric flora; tests for C. difficile toxins A and B were also negative. In a patient with a positive test for C. difficile toxin, these findings are diagnostic of pseudomembranous colitis associated with C. difficile infection, since pseudomembranes may persist for at least two weeks after the toxin has become undetectable. 34,35\\nCytomegalovirus antigen was identified several times in cytospin preparations of peripheral blood cells in this case by immunoperoxidase staining for cytomegalovirus intermediate early antigen.36,37 In addition, large, atypical infected cells were identified that may have been endothelial cells. Their presence is correlated with a poor prognosis. 36,37\\nC. difficile is the causative agent in most cases of pseudomembranous colitis and approximately 20 percent of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea without colitis. This toxin-mediated disease causes watery diarrhea in 90 to 95 percent of infected patients; 5 to 10 percent have hemorrhagic diarrhea. Pseudomembranes are most prominent in the patients who have the most severe symptoms. C. difficile can be cultured in 3 percent of healthy adults, 2 to 11 percent of hospitalized patients who are not receiving antibiotics, and 21 to 46 percent of symptomatic hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics. 27,35,38\\nColonization by these bacteria is the result of ingestion of spores that survive the acid of the stomach and germinate in the small and large intestine. Ingestion of these spores is a consequence of environmental contamination, and their fomites commonly include hospital furniture, equipment, and medical personnel. In patients with normal colonic flora, germinated spores and vegetative cells do not survive, and colonization does not occur.39 However, in patients receiving antibiotics or chemotherapy, who have altered or diminished flora, the natural resistance to C. difficile colonization is absent. The mechanism of this resistance is unclear, but other clostridial anaerobes or yeasts are thought to be involved.\\nThe colitis is caused by two secreted exotoxins, enterotoxin A and cytotoxin B. Enterotoxin A binds to the enterocyte through a specific brush-border glycoprotein receptor containing galactose and N-acetylglucosamine. Cytotoxin B is much more potent. Both toxins are leukocyte chemoattractants and activators, and their proinflammatory effects are probably responsible for the severe inflammation associated with pseudomembranous colitis. 27,38\\nUp to 50 percent of patients with advanced HIV infection have reactivated cytomegalovirus in their blood leukocytes. Reactivation of latent disease in immunosuppressed patients can cause retinitis, encephalitis, adrenalitis, pneumonitis, and gastrointestinal infection. Cytomegalovirus colitis presents with watery diarrhea in 80 percent of the cases and with bloody diarrhea in 20 percent.40 Frequently, antiviral therapy is palliative, but in some cases the hematochezia and bloody diarrhea require surgical intervention.14,41\\nCytomegalovirus commonly infects endothelial cells and monocytes and occasionally infects epithelial cells, including those of the thymic medulla, and smoothmuscle cells. Large, eosinophilic cytomegalic inclusions are characteristic of infection and are most commonly seen in the capillary endothelium.42 Cytomegalovirus increases HLA class II antigens, induces an as-yet uncharacterized procoagulant activity, and causes the adherence of neutrophils to endothelial cells.43-45 These changes in the endothelium may result in the vasculopathy and ischemia commonly found in cases of gastrointestinal cytomegalovirus infection.\\nIn conclusion, pseudomembrane formation in colitis is most commonly associated with toxin-producing infections by C. difficile. However, pseudomembrane formation is a common pathologic pathway for a variety of toxic or infectious processes that cause mucosal injury and ulceration. Two such processes involved the colon in this patient.\\nDr. PEGGY L. UEDA: The patient had an initially slow recovery, but his weight eventually returned to its usual level. He was subsequently relatively well and probably healthier than he had been in about a year. He continued to receive foscarnet.\\nADDENDUM\\nDR. UEDA: It has been six months since the ileocolectomy was performed, and the patient\\'s health has been relatively stable, and he has maintained his weight. His main symptom is fatigue. Adequate hydration has been a problem because of the loss of fluid from the ileostomy. A low-grade fever recently developed and is being evaluated.',\n",
       " \"A newborn boy was admitted to the hospital because of a rash and respiratory distress.\\nThe infant was born at 3:35 p.m. by cesarean section at 34 weeks' gestation to a 37-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2). The pregnancy had been complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus, which was controlled by diet, and by “bronchitis” during the two months before delivery; the mother was treated with amoxicillin. She also used an iron preparation and multivitamin tablets during the gestation. She reported that she had had varicella in childhood; did not use other medications, illicit drugs, alcohol, or tobacco; and had no other infections and no rash during the pregnancy. Prenatal screening tests showed that the mother's blood group was O, Rh-positive, with immunity to rubella; serologic tests were negative for syphilis and hepatitis B surface antigen. During the three days before delivery, the mother experienced a decrease in fetal movements, and on the day of the birth, fetal ultrasound tracings were reported to contain decelerations. After the infant had been delivered by cesarean section, the Apgar scores were 4 at 1 minute and 6 at 5 and 10 minutes, and intermittent assisted ventilation was required. Examination of the boy showed generalized vesicles, some of which were hemorrhagic, and prominent lymphadenopathy. Ampicillin and gentamicin were administered intravenously, and the trachea was intubated. A radiograph of the chest and abdomen (Fig. 1) showed, in addition to an endotracheal tube, diffuse bilateral reticulonodular opacities, a small right pleural effusion, and hepatosplenomegaly. During the infant's transport to this hospital, many more vesicles became hemorrhagic. He was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at 7:29 p.m.\\nBoth parents, a six-year-old sister, and a seven-year-old brother were well. The mother worked in a day-care facility.\\nThe infant's temperature was 36.9°C, and his pulse was 156; respirations were 35 with mechanical ventilation; his blood pressure was 50/25 mm Hg, with a mean arterial pressure of 38 mm Hg. His weight was 2.45 kg. The ventilator pressure was 30/5 mm Hg, and the inspired fraction of oxygen was 55 percent.\\nOn physical examination, the infant had innumerable vesicles, 2 to 5 mm in diameter, distributed over the skin and the palate, without being clustered (Fig. 2). Firm, matted lymph nodes, 1 to 3 cm in diameter, were present in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions. No dysmorphic features were observed. The head was normal. The mucous membranes were generally pink and moist, and the palate was intact. The neck was supple. The breath sounds were coarse bilaterally. The heart was normal. The liver and spleen descended 3 to 4 cm below the costal margins. The genitalia appeared normal for a male infant, with the testes not easily palpable. Good femoral pulses were noted bilaterally. The neurologic examination was normal.\\nLaboratory tests were performed (Tables 1, 2, and 3). An electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia at a rate of 175, with considerable base-line artifact, and no other abnormalities. Microscopical examination of a stained specimen of the tracheal aspirate showed rare neutrophils and no microorganisms. A Tzanck preparation from a vesicle and a direct fluorescent-antibody test for herpes simplex virus were negative. A cardiac ultrasonographic examination disclosed severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, with a systolic right-to-left shunt through a patent ductus arteriosus of moderate size; left ventricular function was hyperdynamic. No evidence of structural heart disease was detected.\\nMultiple specimens were obtained for cultures, serologic studies, and other examinations. Ampicillin, gentamicin, acyclovir, dopamine, and dobutamine were given intravenously. Transfusions of packed red cells and platelets and infusions of fresh-frozen plasma were administered. No oral intake was provided. The boy's respiratory status deteriorated progressively, despite the use of high-frequency ventilation. Pink, frothy fluid was aspirated from the endotracheal tube, but no evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage was observed. Hypotension responded only transiently to inotropic medications and repeated fluid boluses; during the final hours of the infant's life, it was impossible to maintain the mean arterial pressure consistently above 40 mm Hg. The platelet count did not increase after transfusions of platelets, and the prothrombin time ranged as high as 29 seconds, with a control value of 11 seconds, despite boluses of fresh-frozen plasma. Numerous petechiae were noted on the second hospital day. All blood cultures remained sterile.\\nThe infant died at 8 p.m. on the second hospital day.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. LISA H. LERNER*: May we review the radiologic findings?\\nDR. SUSAN A. CONNOLLY: A radiograph of the chest and abdomen (Fig. 1) shows diffuse reticulonodular opacities throughout the lungs, a right pleural effusion, and hepatosplenomegaly. The endotracheal tube is in the appropriate position.\\nDR. LERNER: The primary lesion described in this case is a vesicle. A vesicle is a small blister, a pustule is a vesicle filled with purulent material, and a bulla is a blister larger than 1 cm. Vesicles, pustules, and bullae may coexist. Erosions, ulcers, and crusted papules or plaques are secondary lesions that may result from the rupture of vesicles, pustules, or bullae. The differential diagnosis of a vesicular eruption in a newborn infant is extensive. I shall briefly review the lesions one should consider when evaluating a well-appearing neonate with vesicles, and then discuss in greater detail the differential diagnosis in this case, in which widespread blistering was present at birth in a systemically ill infant.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nCongenital disseminated viral infection with bilateral pneumonitis.\\nDR. LISA H. LERNER'S DIAGNOSIS\\nCongenital Langerhans’-cell histiocytosis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. ELIZABETH M. BAILEY: Microscopical examination of the skin lesions at autopsy revealed epidermal ulceration overlying a papillary dermal infiltrate of atypical, large, dyshesive cells, which infiltrated the epidermis focally (Fig. 3 and 4). The cells had abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and convoluted nuclei with red nucleoli. Some cells were multinucleated. An infiltrate composed of mixed inflammatory cells included numerous eosinophils. The thymus and abdominal lymph nodes were effaced by a diffuse infiltrate of similar cells, with areas of necrosis. In the lungs we found peribronchial infiltration by the atypical cells, with diffuse infiltration in some areas (Fig. 5). In addition to extramedullary hematopoiesis, the liver and spleen contained atypical cells, which formed solid nodules in the liver. The lamina propria of the colon was infiltrated focally by the same cells, with overlying mucosal ulceration. Examination of the brain revealed a single collection of similar cells in the lateral pons. Immunohistochemical staining of frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue was positive for S-100 protein and CD1a, CD45, CD68, CD13, and CD14 antigens and was negative for T- and B-lymphocyte markers (CD3, CD7, CD10, and CD20 antigens and kappa and lambda light chains) and a granulocyte marker (myeloperoxidase). The cells were also negative for chloroacetate esterase. Electron-microscopical examination showed characteristic features of Langerhans' cells, although Birbeck granules were not seen.\\nLetterer-Siwe disease, the subtype of Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis this patient had, is the most fulminant form of the disorder, with an onset in infancy or early childhood, disseminated disease, and often a fatal course.\\nAlthough Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis may present at any age, the peak incidence is between one and three years. Boys are affected more often than girls.47 The nature of the disorder is not yet fully known; it has been considered a reactive process,47 although recent studies showing an aberrant immunophenotype48 and clonal proliferation49 suggest a neoplastic process.48 The cause of Langerhans’-cell histiocytosis is still unknown; an immunologic impairment has been considered as a possible cause,50,51 perhaps initially mediated by a virus.50 Although human herpesvirus 6 DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in almost half the lesions tested in one study,52 another study failed to detect viral genomes (human herpesvirus 6 and other viruses) in lesional tissue with the use of similar techniques.51\",\n",

Two weeks be-\\nfore admission, drenching night sweats developed.\\nTwelve days before admission, a sensation of chilli-\\nness, without frank rigors, and a dry cough devel-\\noped. He was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was an unemployed native of Hon-\\nduras who had immigrated to the United States\\nthree years before admission. A tuberculin skin test\\n(purified protein derivative, 5 TU), performed seven\\nweeks before admission, was positive. The patient\\nhad no symptoms, and the physical examination and\\na radiograph of the chest were normal; in view of his\\nage, no treatment was prescribed. He had experi-\\nenced occasional retro-orbital headaches and had\\nlost 2 kg in weight during the acute illness. There\\nwas no history of dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis,\\nnausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria,\\nrisk factors for human immunodeficiency virus\\n(HIV) infection, recent travel, or tuberculous infec-\\ntion or exposure to it. He did not smoke or drink\\nalcohol.\\nThe temperature was 38.3°C, the pulse was 82,\\nand the respirations were 14. The blood pressure\\nwas 140/75 mm Hg.\\nthe remaining lung regions were clear.

The temperature rose daily to\\n39.2°C. Tests for legionella urinary antigen and anti-\\nHIV antibodies were negative; examination of two\\ninduced sputum specimens revealed no acid-fast\\nbacilli or Pneumocystis carinii, and a culture yielded\\nnormal respiratory tract flora. On the third hospital\\nday, increased dullness was noted at the base of the\\nleft lung. The urea nitrogen, creatinine, and elec-\\ntrolyte levels were normal. The results of other lab-\\noratory tests are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Radi-\\nographs of the chest showed a large left pleural\\neffusion that obscured much of the left lung and\\nthe cardiac contour; the right lung and medi-\\nastinum appeared normal. A left-sided thoracente-\\nsis yielded 35 ml of moderately turbid, yellow fluid\\n(Table 3). Microscopical examination of stained spec-\\nimens of the fluid revealed abundant red cells and\\nmoderate numbers of neutrophils, with no acid-fast\\nbacilli or other microorganisms; cytologic examina-\\ntion showed an atypical lymphoid population and\\nraised a question of lymphoma. The fever persisted\\nwithout change.\\nA radiograph of the chest obtained on the fourth\\nhospital day was unchanged except for a slight de-\\ncrease in the left pleural effusion. A test for antibod-\\nies against native DNA was negative. Another left-\\nsided thoracentesis was performed, with the removal\\nof 1300 ml of fluid. Repeated radiographs of the\\nchest showed a considerable decrease in the size of\\nthe effusion; there was air-space disease in the left\\nlower lobe, which was consistent with the presence\\nof atelectasis. The right lung was clear, and the size\\nof the heart was normal.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. MARK S. DRAPKIN*: May we review the ra-\\ndiographs, Dr. McLoud?\\nDR. THERESA C. MCLOUD: The first radiograph of\\nthe chest shows a left pleural effusion (Fig. 1). The\\nunderlying left lower lobe is obscured, but there is\\nno obvious evidence of parenchymal lung disease.\\nThe remainder of the lungs appears clear. The heart\\nappears normal, and there is no evidence of lymphad-\\nenopathy. The radiograph obtained on the third hos-\\npital day shows an increase in the pleural effusion.\\nThe final radiograph, obtained after a thoracentesis\\nhad been performed, shows a decrease in the effusion\\nand subsegmental atelectasis at the left base.\\nDR. DRAPKIN: My task is to determine the cause\\nof a pleural effusion. Diseases that affect the pleura\\nare numerous and varied.1,2 In this case, the ratio of\\nthe protein concentration in pleural fluid to that in\\nserum was higher than 0.5, and the ratio of the lac-\\ntate dehydrogenase concentration in pleural fluid to\\nthat in serum was higher than 0.6 findings that\\ndefine the effusion as an exudate. Disorders such as\\ncongestive heart failure, cirrhosis, the nephrotic syn-\\ndrome, obstruction of the superior vena cava, myx-\\nedema, and sarcoidosis tend to cause transudates\\nand are therefore unlikely.\\nThe pleural-fluid glucose concentration in the\\n*Chairman, Department of Medicine, Newton-Wellesley Hospital; asso-\\nciate professor of medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine.\\n500\\nAugust 15, 1996\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Could the\\npatient have had a pulmonary embolism? Although\\nthe composition of the pleural fluid in patients with\\nembolism can vary widely, this diagnosis is unlikely,\\nbecause the patient under discussion had no obvious\\npredisposition to emboli, his respiratory rate was\\nnormal, and he presented with a subacute illness.\\nThere is also no evidence of gastrointestinal disease,\\nsuch as a pancreatic or hepatic abscess or esophageal\\nperforation, nor is there evidence of systemic lupus\\nerythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or another col-\\nlagen vascular disease. The patient had not been re-\\nceiving drugs, such as nitrofurantoin or dantrolene,\\nthat can cause effusions, and the composition of the\\npleural fluid did not suggest a hemothorax due to a\\nrib fracture or blood-vessel disruption.\\nCould the patient have had a chylothorax? The\\nfluid was yellow and moderately turbid. We are not\\ntold whether it was centrifuged to permit examina-\\ntion of the supernatant, but the turbidity can be as-\\ncribed to the presence of 8000 white cells per cubic\\nmillimeter.\\nI am therefore left with two major classes of dis-\\nease: neoplastic and infectious. Are there any epide-\\nmiologic clues to the diagnosis? The patient came to\\nthe United States from Honduras seven years ago. In\\n1985, there were about 50 cases of tuberculosis re-\\nported in that country per 100,000 population, an\\nincidence about five times that in the United States.3\\nChagas\\' disease has increased in frequency in Hon-\\nduras in recent years, and an estimated 7000 Hondu-\\nran immigrants in the United States are infected, but\\nthat infection would cause a transudative effusion\\ndue to congestive heart failure. 3,4 Leukemia or lym-\\nphoma associated with human T-cell lymphotropic\\nvirus type I (HTLV-I) occurs in neighboring Latin\\nAmerican countries, but I found only one report of\\nsuch a case in a patient from Honduras, who resided\\nin New Orleans.5 According to one report, all 15\\nchildren with Hodgkin\\'s disease in Honduras had\\ndemonstrable Epstein-Barr virus in their tumors.6\\nFrom an epidemiologic point of view, tuberculosis is\\na more likely diagnosis than these other disorders.\\nNonetheless, I shall consider neoplasms first. Pri-\\nmary lung carcinoma is unlikely in this case, since no\\nmalignant tumor cells were found on cytologic ex-\\namination of the pleural fluid and no mass was evi-\\ndent on radiographs, even after thoracentesis had\\nbeen performed. Likewise, there is nothing to sug-\\ngest a metastatic tumor, and there was no evidence\\nof mesothelioma, such as a history of exposure to as-\\nbestos or the presence of pleural calcifications.\\nAmong the tumors that should be considered,\\nfever, weight loss, and sweats are all consistent with\\nthat diagnosis. Pleural lymphoma can be present\\nwithout evidence of peripheral or intrathoracic lym-\\nphadenopathy; this patient had only shotty lymph\\nnodes peripherally, and there were no obvious ab-\\nnormalities on the radiographs of the chest. In one\\nstudy, 71 percent of patients with lymphomatous\\npleural effusions had no radiographic evidence of\\nmediastinal lymphadenopathy. About 20 to 30 per-\\ncent of patients with lymphoma have pleural effu-\\nsions, however, and their presence can be the initial\\nmanifestation of either Hodgkin\\'s or non-Hodgkin\\'s\\nlymphoma.8-10 The very high concentration of lac-\\ntate dehydrogenase in the pleural fluid could be\\nconsidered evidence of lymphoma, but there is a\\nwide range of lactate dehydrogenase values in vari-\\nous types of exudative pleural effusions,¹ in contrast\\nto the consistently low levels in transudative effu-\\nsions. Similarly, the concentrations of albumin and\\nglobulin in the pleural fluid generally parallel those\\nin the serum, as in this patient.\\nThe atypical lymphoid population on cytologic\\nexamination could have been composed of lympho-\\nma cells, perhaps even Reed-Sternberg cells, but I\\nwould have expected the cytologist to recognize the\\nlatter cells. Lymphoma or leukemia associated with\\nHTLV-I is unlikely in the absence of characteristic\\nskin and hematologic findings. In addition, no ab-\\nnormal cells were noted in the peripheral-blood\\nsmear, although an occasional case has been report-\\ned in which an isolated pleural effusion was the ini-\\ntial manifestation.11\\nFinally, I shall consider infections. The effusion\\nwas not an empyema, in view of the negative Gram\\'s\\nstain, the predominance of mononuclear cells, and\\nthe pH of 7.36. A parapneumonic effusion is also\\nunlikely, in view of the lack of a response to broad-\\nspectrum antimicrobial treatment, the nonproduc-\\ntive cough, and the absence of a definite pulmonary\\ninfiltrate after thoracentesis.\\nTuberculosis, on the other hand, is consistent\\nwith all the findings. In 1917, Paterson12 conducted\\nan elegant experiment at the laboratory at Saranac\\nLake in New York. Asking why tubercle bacilli could\\nrarely be isolated from specimens of pleural fluid ob-\\ntained from patients with tuberculosis, he injected\\nan attenuated strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\nsubcutaneously into the thighs of guinea pigs; con-\\ntrol animals received no injection. Three weeks later,\\nall the animals were challenged with an intrapleural\\ninjection of the same strain. Pleural fluid developed\\nonly in the test animals, with histologic changes sim-\\nilar to those seen in patients with tuberculous pleu-\\nrisy. Progressive pleural and subpleural infections\\ndeveloped in the control animals, but not large exu-\\ndative effusions. Subsequent studies in which tuber-\\nculin protein was substituted for live bacilli in both\\nlymphoma is the most likely possibility. The patient\\'s | sensitizing and intrapleural injections yielded similar\\nVolume 335 Number 7\\n501\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

In one study,\\nthe response of circulating T cells to tuberculin was\\nmasked by adherent suppressor cells.18 Negative re-\\nsults of skin tests may also be associated with seques-\\ntration of both helper and suppressor T cells in the\\npleural space.19 This patient had a positive skin test\\nseven weeks before his illness, indicating that his in-\\nfection has been present at least that long. Tubercu-\\nlous pleurisy usually occurs three to seven months\\nafter infection. In studies in Philadelphia and Los\\nAngeles, however, the disorder developed in older\\nadults with post-primary disease. 20,21 Indeed, the\\noverlap between the manifestations of primary and\\nlate infection is emphasized in a recent report22 of\\nan outbreak of tuberculosis among the patrons of a\\nbar in Minneapolis, where a man with tuberculosis\\nspent much of his time for six months. About 40\\npercent of the people who habituated the bar ac-\\nquired the infection. Some of those who had been\\ninfected with a strain identical to the strain in the in-\\ndex patient, as identified by DNA analysis, had cav-\\nitary upper-lung disease, which would ordinarily be\\nconsidered post-primary disease. The patient under\\ndiscussion could have had either primary disease or,\\nin view of his earlier residence in an area where tu-\\nberculosis was highly endemic, post-primary disease.\\nThe clinical course in this patient is consistent\\nwith that of pleural tuberculosis. Pleural pain is ab-\\nsent in about one quarter of the cases.23 Effusions\\nare usually small to moderate, although they can be\\nmassive.24 In only about a third of the cases is paren-\\nchymal disease visible radiographically on the side of\\nthe effusion.23\\nHow does one explain the presence of atypical\\nlymphocytes in the pleural fluid? In a case described\\nin 1985, a patient with a tuberculous effusion had\\n502 August 15, 1996\\natypical lymphocytes.25 In one reported series, anal-\\nysis of the cells in tuberculous effusions from eight\\npatients showed enlarged lymphocytes and nuclei\\nwith \"splintered” chromatin26; a small nucleolus was\\nrecognizable in half the nuclei. Similar findings in\\nthis patient may have led to the reported observa-\\ntion of atypical lymphocytes. In another study, \"re-\\nactive lymphocytes\" were found to predominate in\\neffusions associated with both malignant neoplastic\\nand benign conditions.27 Thus, an atypical lympho-\\ncyte population, as seen in the pleural fluid from the\\npatient under discussion, has limited diagnostic val-\\nue. Although the presence of more than 5 percent\\nmesothelial cells or more than 10 percent eosino-\\nphils in the pleural fluid would constitute evidence\\nagainst tuberculosis, the absence of these findings is\\nnot helpful diagnostically.¹\\nThe diagnostic test was probably a pleural biopsy.\\nAlthough culture of the pleural fluid is positive in\\nonly about 25 percent of cases of tuberculosis, a\\nspecimen from a single, closed pleural biopsy shows\\ngranulomas in about 60 percent of the cases, and\\nthree biopsies demonstrate granulomas in about 80\\npercent of the cases.28 Mycobacterial culture of the\\nbiopsy specimen increases the diagnostic yield to\\nabout 90 percent.28 In a large series in Scandinavia,29\\nthoracoscopic biopsy was found to be superior to\\nclosed biopsy. Examination of the pleural fluid plus\\nneedle biopsy yielded the correct diagnosis in 27 of\\n32 cases of tuberculous pleurisy; thoracoscopic bi-\\nopsy increased the sensitivity, with a correct diag-\\nnosis in 31 of 32 cases. In another study, cytologic\\nexamination of pleural fluid showed evidence of\\nlymphoma in only 25 percent of patients with Hodg-\\nkin\\'s disease but in 75 percent of those with diffuse,\\nlarge-cell lymphoma.8 Pleural biopsy is less helpful in\\nthe diagnosis of lymphoma, which usually depends\\non finding other sites of disease or on cytologic ex-\\namination.\\nSeveral other useful diagnostic tests could have\\nbeen performed. Computed tomography (CT) can\\nreveal parenchymal disease not evident on radio-\\ngraphs of the chest.30 Levels of adenosine deam-\\ninase, an enzyme released primarily from T cells,\\nhave been reported to be elevated in tuberculous ef-\\nfusions but can also be elevated in other condi-\\ntions. 31,32 Lymphocyte subpopulations in pleural flu-\\nid have been analyzed, with B-cell predominance or\\ngene rearrangement suggesting lymphoma.33-36 The\\npolymerase chain reaction has been used to detect\\nmycobacterial DNA in pleural fluid, but many false\\nnegative results occur. 37 Tests for antigens of M. tu-\\nberculosis or antibodies against the organism have\\nbeen used, as well as the detection of tuberculostear-\\nic acid, but the results have been disappointing.1,38\\nIt is important to confirm the diagnosis of tubercu-\\nlous pleurisy, because even though the pleural reac-\\ntion itself abates without treatment, active tubercu-\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

As Nardell states, in his discussion of the case\\nnoted above, “it is widely taught that an exudative\\npleural effusion in a young person with a positive tu-\\nberculin skin test is due to tuberculosis until proved\\notherwise.\"25 I believe a pleural biopsy, perhaps per-\\nformed with a thoracoscope, revealed granulomas,\\nwith organisms demonstrated by stain or culture of\\nthe specimen.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Dr. Nguyen, what were your\\nimpressions during the patient\\'s hospital course?\\nDR. TUNG T. NGUYEN: The findings on the initial\\nexamination were consistent with the presence of\\nconsolidation and a pleural effusion, and the find-\\nings on the chest films were initially interpreted as\\nan infiltrate in the left lower lobe with pleural effu-\\nsion. As a result, the patient was treated for atypical\\npneumonia while we awaited the results of the spu-\\ntum examination. Despite the negative results of\\nthat examination, the high probability of tuberculo-\\nsis and the lack of a response to antibacterial therapy\\nnecessitated additional diagnostic procedures.\\nDR. MARK: Dr. Drapkin, would you have obtained\\na CT scan before performing a biopsy?\\nDR. DRAPKIN: If a CT scan had demonstrated a\\nlesion approachable through the bronchoscope, a\\nbronchoscopic biopsy would have provided another\\napproach to the diagnosis, but a biopsy would have\\nbeen required under any circumstances.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nTuberculous pleuritis, ? tuberculous pneumonia.\\nDR. MARK S. DRAPKIN\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nTuberculous pleurisy.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. MARK: A needle biopsy of the parietal pleura\\nwas performed. Examination of the specimen re-\\nvealed a few ill-defined granulomas (Fig. 2) within a\\ndense lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, which obscured\\nthe interstitial layer of the pleura (Fig. 3). No mes-\\nothelial cells remained. Acid-fast stains showed one\\nor two beaded mycobacteria (Fig. 4) within small ar-\\neas of necrosis on each of three slides. M. tuberculosis\\nwas cultured from the specimen. In cases of pleural\\ntuberculosis, as in this case, lymphocytosis may oc-\\ncur in the absence of mesothelial cells in the pleural\\nfluid, because the granulomatous inflammation re-\\nplaces the mesothelial lining cells.41 Granulomas have\\nbeen reported on biopsy in only 44 percent of pa-\\ntients with pleural tuberculosis associated with HIV\\ninfection but in 84 percent of HIV-negative patients\\nwith pleural tuberculosis.42\\nFigure 2.

Specimen from a Pleural Needle Biopsy Showing\\nBeaded Mycobacterium (Arrow) (Acid-Fast Stain, ×1200).\\nPleuritis is often the first clinical manifestation of\\npulmonary tuberculosis. The tuberculous effusion\\nusually appears 3 months43 to 12 months44 after the\\nprimary infection. In the era before antibiotic treat-\\nment was available, an analysis of 1027 cases of tu-\\nberculosis, in most of which acute tuberculous pleu-\\nrisy was the first clinical sign and none of which\\ninvolved more than minimal parenchymal lesions on\\nchest radiographs, pulmonary tuberculosis became\\nmanifest within two years in 47 percent of the cases\\nand within five years in 85 percent; over half the pa-\\ntients had a positive sputum examination or cavita-\\ntion.44 Bilateral tuberculous pleural effusions were\\nfollowed by hematogenous dissemination to multi-\\nple organs and were associated with a grave progno-\\nsis in the preantibiotic era.45 In a study of 2333 cases\\nof tuberculosis, tuberculosis of one or more serosal\\nsurfaces was found in 209 cases and involved only\\nthe pleura in 55 of those 209.46 In 15 of 103 cases\\nwith pleural involvement, caseous pleural tuberculo-\\nsis was the oldest active process, except for the pri-\\nmary complex. Tuberculous or pyogenic empyema\\nhad developed in 16 percent of the patients with\\nchronic pulmonary tuberculosis studied at autopsy\\nduring the era when the disease was treated by cre-\\nating an artificial pneumothorax. The empyema com-\\nplicated the procedure in patients with cavities that\\ncommunicated with a bronchus, and the evolution\\nof a serous effusion into empyema usually resulted\\nfrom the creation of a bronchopleural fistula.47 Cul-\\nture-positive effusions developed despite antibiotic\\ntherapy, 48 and the incidence of pleural tuberculosis\\ndid not change during the 10-year interval from\\n1977 to 1986.49\\nFive mechanisms have been proposed to explain\\nhow pleuritis can be the first manifestation of tuber-\\nculosis: the spread of organisms from the primary\\ncomplex in the lung, the spread of organisms from\\ninfectious foci apart from the primary complex, the\\nspread of organisms along the pleural lymphatics\\nfrom caseous foci in hilar lymph nodes, hematog-\\nenous dissemination, and a hypersensitivity reac-\\ntion. 43,44,46,50 The direct invasion of organisms into\\nthe visceral pleura from a subpleural focus of any\\ntype of active infection is probably the most fre-\\nquent mechanism. In one study, a caseous focus in\\nthe lung contiguous to diseased pleura was identi-\\nfied surgically in 12 of 15 patients with tuberculosis\\nwho presented with effusions.13 The pleura was thick-\\ner than 1 cm in 13 of the patients. Multiple small\\nfoci of tuberculosis were found in the lung paren-\\nchyma in seven patients, and a nidus for pleural con-\\ntamination was found in five of the seven. The dis-\\nease had not been detected on plain films of the\\nchest. No evidence of the spread of organisms from\\ncaseous lymph nodes was found.13 A hypersensitivity\\nreaction may explain cases in which biopsy findings\\nand cultures are negative.\\nDR. DRAPKIN: In a 1955 surgical study by Stead\\net al., 13 subpleural foci were noted in most of the pa-\\ntients with tuberculous pleurisy. In addition, in an-\\nother study, subpleural foci were noted on CT scan-\\nning in patients who had tuberculous pleurisy without\\nevidence of parenchymal disease on plain chest radio-\\ngraphs.30 Because of these findings, I favor the expla-\\nnation that the infection spread from subpleural foci\\nrather than from lymphatics.\\nDR. MARK: What are the public health conse-\\nquences of this patient\\'s disease? Should he be viewed\\nas infectious?\\nDR. DRAPKIN: In general, a patient without evi-\\ndence of parenchymal disease on chest films and\\nwithout a cough is not considered infectious. Al-\\nthough a sputum culture can be positive in such a pa-\\ntient, it is usually negative, indicating a low level of\\ninfectivity.\\nDR.

       " \"CLINICAL PROBLEM-SOLVINGClinical Problem-SolvingLEARNING FROM OUR ERRORSJEREMY BROWN, M.B., B.S.,MICHAEL G. WORTHINGTON, M.D.,AND ELLEN S. LATHI, M.D.A 50-year-old black man was brought to theemergency room. He had been unable to movehis legs for four days and complained of im-paired speech.The lesion in this patient may be in the lower-cra-nial-nerve area, perhaps due to a basilar meningitis,or somewhere in the cerebral hemispheres. I assume that it does not appear septic, because this was notdescribed as his presenting picture. He appears tohave a global process that is affecting his brain stemrather than higher cortical function, since he is notdescribed as confused. What additional informationdo we have?The patient had insulin-dependent diabetesmellitus and mild hypertension controlled withan angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor. Sixmonths earlier he had slipped at work, and afterthat time he had noted that his personality hadchanged. He worked on a construction site andhad not previously been hospitalized. He livedwith his father. His physical examination dis-closed slurred speech, an expressive dysphasia, andsome naming errors. He could not name thePresident. There were no other abnormal find-ings on the general or neurologic examination.Strength was mildly diminished in his legs, andhis right plantar reflex was upward. His com-plete blood count and electrolyte tests revealed awhite-cell count of 7800 per cubic millimeter, ahemoglobin level of 13.4 g per deciliter, a bloodurea nitrogen level of 43 mg per deciliter, and acreatinine level of 2.2 mg per deciliter.The fall and change in personality make me con-cerned about some sort of traumatic intracranialprocess, such as a subdural hematoma, although it isFrom the Department of Emergency Medicine, Boston Medical Center(J.B.), and the Departments of Infectious Disease (M.G.W.) and Neurol-ogy (E.S.L.), St. Elizabeth's Medical Center of Boston both in Boston.Address reprint requests to Dr. Brown at the Department of EmergencyMedicine, Boston Medical Center, 818 Harrison Ave., Boston, MA02118.©1996, Massachusetts Medical Society.unusual for the patient himself to note a personalitychange. Even more, I would suspect a much moreprogressive lesion with no relation to the fall atwork, given the long time span involved. His physi-cal examination demonstrates that he has a disorderof higher cortical function, probably in the lefthemisphere, and that the lesion might not be isolat-ed to the brain stem, as I first thought. His rightplantar reflex was upward, which confirms the pres-ence of a lesion in the left hemisphere. Since hecould not name the President, I suspect that he alsohas involvement of his temporal lobe. I do not thinkthat his hypertension, diabetes, or mild renal impair-ment is a factor here. I am concerned about someslow-growing process in and around the left-tempo-ral-lobe speech area, which has clearly affected thecorona radiata and is giving him problems with hislegs. I doubt that he has a lower-motor-neuron orspinal cord problem, but I would not exclude thispossibility without a more detailed neurologic exam-ination. We need to consider toxic, metabolic, andinfectious causes, especially human immunodeficien-cy virus (HIV) infection, but we have a very widedifferential diagnosis at the moment. With the infor-mation we have so far, I am concerned that it is notthe fall that caused this disorder, but rather a slow-growing intracranial lesion.Computed tomographic (CT) and magneticresonance imaging (MRI) scans of the head re-vealed a large mass in the left frontal lobe withextensive surrounding edema, an effaced thirdventricle, and possible early left tentorial herni-ation (Fig. 1). The findings were thought to bemost consistent with a glioma.The scans confirm that he has a large lesion in theleft side of his brain, near the centers that controlfunctions such as speech, memory, and naming. Withthe amount of surrounding edema, the lesion mayalso be causing pressure on the frontal lobes. If thehistory really extends back six months, the picture isconsistent with a very slow growing neoplasm or aninfection. I would consider astrocytomas, other slow-growing brain tumors, and tumors coming from an-other area of the body, such as a slow-growing renal-cell carcinoma. I am making the assumption thatthis is a slow-growing lesion, given the history of afall six months ago, which may have occurred be-cause he was unable to flex his foot. Infections toconsider include toxoplasmosis although it is alittle too slow for that as well as neurosyphilis ora tuberculoma.Volume 335 Number 141049The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Gadolinium-Enhanced T₁-Weighted Coronal MRI ScanObtained on Admission.A large subcortical ring-enhancing mass with an irregular rimand an isodense center is visible. There is compression of theleft frontal horn and third ventricle, midline shift, and subfal-cine herniation.Figure 2. Chest X-Ray Film Showing a Right-Upper-Lobe Nod-ule (Arrows).The patient was treated with dexamethasoneand mannitol. Within two days he became morealert and able to follow commands. His abil-ity to repeat names also improved. A stereotacticbrain biopsy was performed. On the basis of afrozen section, a diagnosis of malignant glioma was made. Chest radiography (Fig. 2) revealed aleft-lung infiltrate and a 2-cm nodule in theright upper lobe.I am concerned with a diagnosis of malignant glio-ma made on the basis of a frozen section alone. If Ihave ever made a mistake, it is in giving a diagnosisearly on the basis of a frozen section, and I wouldwait for the final pathology report before going onwith any treatment. A diagnosis of glioma certainlyfits with the clinical data. However, the question iswhether the radiographic findings and the brain le-sion are tied together. It is hard to make this linkwith a glioma. I am not convinced that there is aninfiltrate here, although there is certainly a lungnodule. I would like to get a CT scan of the chestto delineate the lesion. Because of the very large dif-ferential diagnosis, I would want to know moreabout the patient. Does he smoke? What are his riskfactors for HIV? Has he been sick on the construc-tion site? Has he had a cough for some time? I amalso waiting for the final pathology report on thecentral nervous system lesion and continue to bevery hesitant to make a diagnosis on the basis of thefrozen section. Certainly at his age the common tu-mors may include gliomas, but we should also con-sider renal-cell and lung carcinomas, as well as thy-roid cancer. Melanoma would be unusual, given thatthe patient is black. We should know the results ofa Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test and theHIV status of anyone who has a central nervous sys-tem process. In the absence of a fever, I would notstart antibiotic treatment at this time.Treatment with ceftriaxone was begun. A chestCT scan revealed multiple upper-lobe nodulesthat suggested metastatic disease. During a CT-guided biopsy of one of the nodules, the patienthad a generalized seizure that lasted one minute,and no tissue was obtained. Phenytoin therapywas initiated, and three days later a second CT-guided percutaneous biopsy of the right upperlobe was performed.The important question here is whether the lunglesion is a primary tumor or metastases. It is very un-usual for a glioma to metastasize to the lung in thisway. A glioma can certainly metastasize to the boneand other areas, but I am not aware of this kind ofpresentation. I suspect that there was some lesion inthe lung that spread to the brain, but this sequencecannot explain why the brain mass looks so much1050 October 3, 1996The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

I doubt that there is any-thing bathed by the cerebrospinal fluid that is caus-ing an inflammatory process, and without fevers anda more impressive degree of leukocytosis, I wouldnot perform a lumbar puncture. The patient couldcertainly have a lymphoma in his lung, especially be-cause lymphomas can present in unusual ways. Thelung nodules do raise the possibility of vasculitis andsarcoid, both of which can present with cerebral in-volvement. It is a very large lesion for sarcoid, andone would expect more findings on the chest x-rayfilm, given so much central nervous system involve-ment. I would still insist that we need to wait for thefinal results of the brain biopsy to tell whether it isa glioma and not an infectious process, although itis difficult to consider an infectious cause withoutmore evidence of inflammatory tissue on the brainbiopsy.After the lung biopsy, whole-brain radiationtherapy was begun. Cytologic examination of thelung tissue suggested a necrotizing granuloma-tous inflammatory process, without evidence ofa tumor. The final histologic description of thebrain-biopsy specimen identified gliosis and ne-crotic tissue consistent with the presence of amalignant tumor.Reactive gliosis and necrotic tissue, together withthe lung process, now convince me that we are deal-ing with a slow-growing infectious process in thebrain. I want to know his purified-protein-derivative(PPD) status. Tuberculosis remains a possibility, asdoes a cryptococcoma or an actinomycotic process,perhaps starting in his teeth and metastasizing tohis lungs and brain. All these chronic indolent in-fections remain possible diagnoses, as do Wegener'sgranulomatosis and some of the other vasculitic proc-esses. It is important to test for antineutrophil cyto-plasmic antibodies, and I would again look closely atthe patient for any evidence of a metastatic infec-tion, perhaps from his mouth. We need to get eithera larger specimen of the brain lesion or an acid-fast-bacillus smear from the initial brain-biopsy specimenor one of the lung nodules. Doing a bronchoscopyat this point would be of little value, although it isless invasive than many of the other tests. If the pa-tient is not anergic and if he has a negative PPD test,the suspicion of tuberculosis can be laid to rest, andI would then suggest an open-lung biopsy.A PPD test was performed, and several sputumsamples were analyzed for acid-fast bacilli. Thepatient was anergic. The lung biopsy was negativefor acid-fast bacilli and fungi, and sputum cul-tures and a cryptococcal-antigen test were nega-tive, as was an HIV test. MRI revealed two deepleft frontoparietal masses, with less edema andmass effect noted than previously. A second ster-eotactic brain biopsy was performed. Frozen sec-tions of brain tissue showed only reactive gliosis,and permanent sections revealed reactive gliosisand a proliferative vascular pattern suggestive ofinfarcted tumor. No granulomas were seen.I am worried about starting radiotherapy withouta definitive diagnosis. The patient is anergic, so hisPPD test is not helpful, but this anergy may havebeen due to the high doses of corticosteroids givento him early on. He is HIV-negative but the evi-dence that this is an infection is now even more con-vincing. He has two deep left frontoparietal masseswith very distinct capsules and necrosis, one ofwhich is very peripheral. Incidentally, this locationmay explain his seizures, because the mass abuts thegray matter, which can make it extremely epilepto-genic. Could this be a tumor? Yes, but then the lungnodules are not easily explained. I am also hesitantto call this a primary glioma with lesions side byside. We still do not have a definitive diagnosis. I re-turn to all the infections, and tuberculosis is certain-ly one of the things it could be. I hope that cultureswere sent for all the rarer causes, such as actinomycesand nocardia, as well as acid-fast bacilli. I would likethe results of blood cultures, which I assume wereperformed early on, although I doubt that he hasendocarditis.The patient remained severely dysnomic, withnonfluent speech and a mild right pronator drift.Radiation therapy was discontinued, given thatno malignant process was positively identified.The patient did not appear to have an infectiousprocess, and his white-cell count remained withinthe normal range. However, his erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate was 66 mm per hour. The neurol-ogy team following the patient suggested thepossibility of nocardia, actinomyces, and otherfungal infections. Liquid-medium cultures fromthe second brain biopsy grew gram-positive cocci.An echocardiogram was normal.I am glad that the radiation treatment was stopped.In many patients with primary brain abscesses, eventhose caused by pyogenic organisms, leukocytosismay be absent, and the patients are often not febrile.The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is rarely helpfuland does not aid us here. The liquid-medium cul-tures from the second brain biopsy showed gram-positive cocci. Contaminants are common in placessuch as the emergency department, but I would beconcerned about this finding in material from theoperating room, where the patient's head was cleanedand shaved. I have never seen or heard of a stereo-tactic brain biopsy that came up with a contaminant.I would like to know whether multiple blood cul-Volume 335 Number 141051The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

For the moment Iwould have to assume that the patient has a pyogen-ic infection and would treat him with large doses ofpenicillin while waiting for better identification ofthe organism.The patient had an open-brain biopsy oneweek after the second stereotactic biopsy. Frozensection disclosed necrotizing granulomatous in-flammation, but permanent section revealed manyacid-fast bacilli. The patient was treated withisoniazid, ethambutol, rifampin, and pyrazin-amide. Within one week of antituberculous treat-ment, the patient's speech improved, and hisability to follow commands returned to normal.He was discharged from the hospital to a reha-bilitation home two weeks after the open-brainbiopsy and six weeks after his original pres-entation.DISCUSSIONBrain tumor was the leading diagnosis in this pa-tient for many days after admission to the hospital.The initial findings strongly suggested a slow-grow-ing mass lesion, and the CT scan obtained shortlyafter admission strongly suggested a tumor. The pa-tient had no evidence of systemic infection. At thispoint, the results of the stereotactic biopsy musthave seemed to confirm the diagnosis of brain tu-mor. However, the pulmonary findings on chest ra-diography, CT, and lung biopsy must have been dif-ficult to explain, given the presumptive diagnosis ofglioma of the brain, yet the patient's brain was irra-diated. The results of the second stereotactic biopsywere no more helpful. \",\n",

ZALEZNIK: After acid-fast bacilli were noted\\nin material from the tracheostomy site, the patient\\nwas treated presumptively for infection with Myco-\\nbacterium tuberculosis or atypical mycobacteria. I\\nshall assume that the diagnostic report that was re-\\nceived was the result of a culture performed 34 days\\nearlier.\\nThere are several possible explanations for the\\nfindings in this case. Granulomatous inflammation is\\na common complication of long-term tracheosto-\\nmies and has been reported in up to 60 percent of\\npatients who had tracheostomies because of ob-\\nstructive airway lesions.¹ Necrotizing granulomas\\nand acid-fast bacilli, however, are not the usual find-\\nings. I shall assume that this patient was immuno-\\nsuppressed because of corticosteroid treatment, al-\\nthough it is not clear whether he was still taking\\nmethylprednisolone at the time of presentation or\\nwhether he received a sufficiently high dose for a\\nlong enough period (at least three weeks) to cause\\nadrenal suppression. Among patients with asthma\\nreceiving short courses of corticosteroid medication,\\nthe risk of a positive PPD test is no higher than that\\nin the general population.\\nIf one focuses on the finding of necrotizing gran-\\nulomas containing acid-fast bacilli in a patient re-\\nceiving corticosteroid medication, one has to con-\\nsider laryngeal tuberculosis as the leading diagnosis.\\nLaryngeal tuberculosis is the most infectious form of\\nthe disease. In the past, it arose as a complication of\\ncavitary tuberculosis, presumably by contiguous\\nspread as tubercle bacilli traversed the larynx during\\nexpectoration. Laryngeal tuberculosis still occurs,\\nbut now the more common route of infection is be-\\nlieved to be hematogenous.2 Nevertheless, laryngeal\\ninvolvement still accompanies pulmonary tuberculo-\\nsis in most cases. The findings on this patient's chest\\nradiograph, however, do not support a diagnosis of\\neither active or past pulmonary disease. Also, the\\nnegative PPD test with positive controls is slight ev-\\nidence against tuberculosis, although delayed-type\\nhypersensitivity should be assessed at 48 hours, and\\nthe result we have was obtained at 24 hours. If the\\npatient had tuberculosis, reactivated disease would\\nbe more likely than primary disease, in the setting of\\ncorticosteroid-induced immunosuppression, but it\\nwould be associated with either a positive PPD test\\nor anergy, instead of a negative test with positive\\ncontrols. The absence of a history of exposure to tu-\\nberculosis is not meaningful, since the patient had\\nemigrated from a country where tuberculosis is en-\\ndemic. Isolation of M. tuberculosis in the laboratory\\nrequires 4 to 6 weeks; the interval of 34 days be-\\ntween the time the culture was presumably obtained\\n1304 October 24, 1996\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Among the atypical\\nmycobacteria, rapidly growing organisms such as\\nM. fortuitum or M. chelonae can be ruled out be-\\ncause of the 34-day interval before receipt of the di-\\nagnostic report, but many other atypical mycobacte-\\nria grow at the same rate as M. tuberculosis. M. avium\\ncomplex and M. scrofulaceum can cause lymphadeni-\\ntis, but the latter organism is found less commonly in\\nthis country than in other countries, and the former\\norganism is associated with pulmonary disease more\\noften than with laryngeal disease. M. haemophilum,\\nanother atypical mycobacterium, is a relatively re-\\ncently described cause of skin and soft-tissue infec-\\ntion in immunocompromised patients. A number of\\ncases have been reported in patients with the ac-\\nquired immunodeficiency syndrome, including one\\npatient with probable laryngeal involvement, al-\\nthough there is no reason to suspect HIV infection\\nin this case. M. haemophilum infections are notable\\nfor the presence of many acid-fast organisms and\\ngranulomas on examination of a biopsy specimen.\\nEvidence against this diagnosis, however, is the slow\\ngrowth of the organism, which often takes as long\\nas eight weeks, partly because it grows optimally at\\nlower temperatures than other mycobacteria.\\nThe finding of acid-fast bacilli may be misleading\\nin this case, although it is hard to ignore their pres-\\nence on more than one occasion, especially in asso-\\nciation with necrotizing granulomas. The organisms\\nappeared to be on the surface of the lesions in the\\nfirst biopsy specimen, however, and were found at\\nthe tracheostomy site on admission. Colonizing\\natypical mycobacteria that are not thought to cause\\ninfection can be found in the environment and may\\nbe contaminating organisms in this case. If I postu-\\nlate that the acid-fast organisms are commensals and\\nare not responsible for the infection, the differential\\ndiagnosis must be enlarged to include other infec-\\ntious agents that could account for a chronic process\\nand granulomatous inflammation. Among bacteria,\\nRhodococcus equi, nocardia, and Klebsiella rhinoscle-\\nromatis should be considered. R. equi causes pneu-\\nmonia in horses, but in immunocompromised hu-\\nmans (especially those taking corticosteroids) who\\nhave been exposed to animals, this organism has pro-\\nduced cavitary disease in the lungs resembling tu-\\nberculosis and, less often, nodular skin lesions and\\ncavitary brain lesions. Infection with nocardia, a\\nbranching filamentous organism that can be acid-\\nfast with a modified acid-fast stain, can present in a\\nsimilar manner. Infection with K. rhinoscleromatis\\nleads to chronic granulomatous infection of the up-\\nper respiratory tract and in rare cases produces air-\\nway obstruction. This infection is uncommon in the\\nUnited States but is endemic in other areas of the\\nworld, including Latin America. Since the patient\\nhad not been to Ecuador for five years, however, this\\ndiagnosis is not likely. The agent of cat scratch dis-\\nease also causes granulomatous inflammation, but\\nthere is no history of exposure that would suggest\\nthat diagnosis.\\nThe other category of infectious agents in the dif-\\nferential diagnosis is fungi. There is at least one re-\\nport of laryngeal histoplasmosis that was mistakenly\\ntreated as tuberculosis. In that case, however, acid-\\nfast organisms were not found. Histoplasmosis is\\nfound in Ecuador, but I would expect pulmonary\\ndisease to be evident in this patient if he had a reac-\\ntivated infection. Candida can infect tracheostomy\\nsites early after insertion of the tube. This patient's\\nlocal disease around the tracheostomy site seemed to\\nrespond to topical antifungal agents. Laryngeal can-\\ndidiasis has been reported in a patient with dissem-\\ninated tuberculosis,5 but candidiasis alone would not\\neasily explain a number of the findings in this case.\\nAmong noninfectious causes, sarcoidosis, which\\nhas been reported to cause isolated laryngeal le-\\nsions, and tumor in a patient who smokes cigarettes\\nare remote considerations.\\nOf interest in this case was the patient's presenta-\\ntion eight and a half months before admission with\\ngranulomas from which no pathogens were isolated,\\nalthough we do not know what cultures were per-\\nformed. Those granulomas may have been caused by\\nthe tracheostomy of long duration, and the rapid,\\nmore exuberant subsequent growths may have re-\\nsulted from immunosuppression by corticosteroids,\\nwith the reactivation of an infection. On balance, I\\nsuspect that the patient had laryngeal tuberculosis,\\nalthough the negative result of the PPD test (if it\\nwas still negative at 48 hours) and the normal chest\\nradiographs argue against this diagnosis.\\nLaryngeal tuberculosis is the most important of\\nthe diseases I have mentioned in the differential di-\\nagnosis of this type of case, because of its high level\\nof infectivity. The patient was appropriately placed\\nin a negative-pressure room for tuberculosis isola-\\ntion. I would have begun antituberculous therapy, as\\nwas done, although I would have been satisfied with\\nisoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide as presump-\\ntive therapy.

DORI F. ZALEZNIK'S DIAGNOSIS\\nTuberculosis of the larynx and tracheostomy site.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. TIMOTHY R. QUINN: The obstructing gran-\\nulation tissue that was removed about a month be-\\nfore admission was not cultured. The diagnostic\\nprocedure consisted of cultures of swabs of the tra-\\ncheostomy site obtained during the most recent ad-\\nmission.\\nThis material was placed on standard mediums for\\nmycobacteria, and the organisms were identified as\\nM. chelonae by standard criteria. These criteria in-\\ncluded growth within seven days, absence of pig-\\nmentation, a positive three-day arylsulfatase test,\\ngrowth on MacConkey agar without crystal violet, a\\nnegative nitrate-reduction test, and absence of iron\\nuptake.8,9 Identification of the species was confirmed\\nby mycobacterial susceptibility testing at the No-\\ncardia/Mycobacteria Research Laboratory of the\\nUniversity of Texas Health Center. The organism\\nwas resistant to pipemidic acid, polymyxin B, and\\ncephalothin and grew at 30°C on trypticase soy agar\\nand Middlebrook 7H10 agar in less than seven\\ndays. 10-16 Susceptibility patterns involving an extensive\\npanel of antibiotics were also used diagnostically.17\\nM. chelonae causes three types of cutaneous dis-\\nease. 18,19 The most common is disseminated cuta-\\nneous disease, which occurs most frequently in an\\nimmunosuppressed host. Patients with localized dis-\\nease (cellulitis and subcutaneous abscess formation),\\nin contrast, are generally not immunosuppressed.\\nThe third and least common type of infection is\\ncatheter-related. The case under discussion is an ex-\\nample of localized cellulitis associated with long-\\nterm use of a catheter in an unusual location. This\\ntype of infection has been reported previously in\\npatients with long-term peritoneal-dialysis cathe-\\nters,20,21 hemodialysis shunts,22,23 and other types of\\nintravenous catheters.19 The histologic lesions are\\nusually characterized by a dimorphic inflammatory\\nresponse with acute inflammatory cells that fre-\\nquently form microabscesses in the dermis and sub-\\ncutis on a background of granulomatous inflamma-\\ntion with epithelioid and giant cells and areas of\\nnoncaseating necrosis. The relative amounts of acute\\nand chronic inflammation do not appear to be relat-\\ned to the duration of the infection. When present,\\norganisms tend to appear in clumps in areas with\\nlarge numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Al-\\nthough the presence of acute inflammation and mi-\\ncroabscesses is consistent with cutaneous disease due\\nto M. chelonae, these features can also result from in-\\nfection due to other mycobacteria, including M. tu-\\nberculosis. In cases in which well-formed granulomas\\nor giant cells are absent or in which the disease oc-\\ncurs in a clinical situation in which a foreign-body\\nreaction is not infrequent, the level of suspicion of\\nmycobacterial disease may be low.19 Culture of the\\norganism remains the method of diagnosis. Meta-\\nbolic and sensitivity characteristics may allow identi-\\nfication of the species. New techniques involving\\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography of mycolic\\nacid esters24 and nucleic acid homology25 may pro-\\nvide the most definitive tests, but they are not yet\\nwidely available.\\nDR. MARLENE L. DURAND: The cultures of the\\ntracheostomy site were positive for mycobacteria\\n72 hours after the patient's admission. We therefore\\nknew that the organism was a rapidly growing my-\\ncobacterium, and the patient was discharged taking\\nciprofloxacin (750 mg orally twice a day) and clarith-\\nromycin (500 mg orally twice a day). We arranged\\nfor his local physicians to follow up.\\nDR. WILLIAM W. MONTGOMERY: Two months\\nafter his discharge, I saw the patient again. There\\nwas no rash, cellulitis, or recurrence of the granula-\\ntion tissue and no evidence of laryngeal or pulmo-\\nnary tuberculosis.\\nDR. DURAND: On the basis of the results of sen-\\nsitivity tests at that time, doxycycline was substituted\\nfor ciprofloxacin, and clarithromycin was continued.\\nFour months after his discharge, the patient re-\\nmained well. He will continue to take the antibiotics\\nfor a total of six months.\\nDR. ZALEZNIK: One of the reasons for not treat-\\ning a patient presumptively for atypical mycobacteria\\ninfection is that the drug susceptibility of these or-\\nganisms varies widely. M. chelonae is one of the atyp-\\nical mycobacteria that do not respond to conven-\\ntional antituberculous therapy. Cefoxitin has been\\nwidely used, according to the literature, particularly\\nfor endocarditis on porcine prosthetic valves.\\nREFERENCES\\n1.

       " \"A 57-year-old woman was admitted to the hospi-\\ntal because of fever, sweats, neuropathy, and multi-\\nple pulmonary nodules.\\nThe patient had been well until nine months\\nearlier, when weakness developed in the left ankle.\\nDuring the following month, she had fevers, night\\nsweats, and fatigue. Electrophysiologic testing per-\\nformed elsewhere revealed a posterior tibial neuropa-\\nthy of mixed demyelinative type. The fevers and night\\nsweats waxed and waned, and the fatigue persisted.\\nThree months before admission, the fevers and night\\nsweats increased, with a rise in the temperature to\\n38.3°C and rigors. She lost 4.5 kg in weight.\\nFive weeks before admission, the patient entered\\nanother hospital, where laboratory examinations were\\nperformed. The values for creatinine, uric acid, elec-\\ntrolytes, and bilirubin were normal. The results of\\nother laboratory tests are shown in Tables 1, 2, and\\n3. Radiographs of the chest showed multiple pulmo-\\nnary nodules. A computed tomographic (CT) scan\\nof the chest (Fig. 1), obtained without the adminis-\\ntration of contrast material, showed multiple nod-\\nules, 4 to 20 mm in diameter, predominantly at the\\nperiphery of the lung bases but also in the left upper\\nand right middle lobes. Many of the lesions were ill\\ndefined, and several contained air bronchograms. A\\nCT scan of the abdomen revealed multiple small he-\\npatic lesions. Microscopical examination of a bone\\nmarrow-biopsy specimen showed no abnormalities.\\nShe was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was a housewife. She had a 30-year\\nhistory of cigarette smoking but had stopped smok-\\ning 6 years earlier. She had recently noted a rash on\\nher buttock that was neither pruritic nor painful.\\nThere was no history of exposure to industrial dusts, risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\\ninfection, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, epistaxis, co-\\nryza, or sinus infections.\\nOn examination, the pulse was 80, the respira-\\ntions were 18, and the blood pressure was 100/60\\nmm Hg. A rash on the right buttock was consistent\\nwith herpes zoster. A white exudate was present on\\nthe right tonsil, and a few crackles were heard at both lung bases. No lymphadenopathy was found. The\\nrectal examination was normal, and a stool specimen\\nwas negative for occult blood. On neurologic exam-\\nination, the patient was diffusely weak, with muscle\\nwasting; dorsiflexion was weak in both feet, especial-\\nly the right foot. A questionable, patchy decrease in\\nthe sensation of light touch was present over both\\nlower legs, with the pinprick sensation preserved;\\nthe sense of position was impaired in the left foot\\nand toes but was normal in the right foot and toes.\\nThe deep-tendon reflexes were ++, except that the\\nankle jerks were absent.\\nThe values for creatinine, uric acid, electrolytes, and\\nbilirubin were normal. The results of other laboratory\\ntests are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3. A radiograph of\\nthe chest showed multiple pulmonary nodules with\\nconfluent opacities at the bases. Microscopical exam-\\nination of a specimen from a needle-aspiration bi-\\nopsy of the lung revealed numerous mildly atypical\\nglandular cells suggestive of low-grade adenocar-\\ncinoma and mixed with rare, markedly atypical but\\ndegenerated mononuclear cells, which raised the\\npossibility of lymphoma with reactive epithelial chang-\\nes. A fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination was nor-\\nmal. Bronchial brushings and bronchoalveolar-lavage\\nspecimens from both lungs contained atypical glan-\\ndular cells, histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells, and\\nreactive-appearing pneumocytes, suggesting a reac-\\ntive process. No acid-fast bacilli were detected. Cul-\\ntures yielded abundant numbers of Staphylococcus\\naureus, moderate numbers of Klebsiella pneumoniae,\\nand Candida albicans. Microscopical examination of\\na transbronchial-biopsy specimen showed one minute\\ngranuloma; no malignant-tumor cells were detected.\\nThe patient was admitted to this hospital.\\nThe temperature was 36.1°C, the pulse was 88,\\nand the respirations were 20. The blood pressure\\nwas 90/50 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient appeared chronically\\nill. Two necrotic lesions with erythematous bases were\\npresent on the left upper thorax, with several lesions\\non the right side of the abdomen.\\nThe urine was positive (+) for protein; the sedi-\\nment contained 1 red cell, 1 white cell, and a few bac-\\nteria per high-power field, with 3 granular casts per\\nlow-power field. The values for creatinine, uric acid,\\nelectrolytes, and bilirubin were normal. Other labora-\\ntory findings are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3. A ra-\\ndiograph of the chest was unchanged. Pulmonary-\\nfunction studies revealed a mild obstructive defect\\nand suboptimal performance by the patient. A lumbar\\npuncture showed grossly bloody fluid that cleared\\nquickly; the fluid in the fourth tube was orange but\\nclear and contained 516 red cells and no white cells\\nper cubic millimeter. The glucose level was 33 mg per\\ndeciliter (1.8 mmol per liter), and the total protein\\nlevel was 102 mg per deciliter. Cytologic examination\\nrevealed no malignant-tumor cells. Microscopical ex-\\namination of a biopsy specimen of an abdominal-wall\\nlesion was consistent with the presence of herpesvirus\\ninfection. Cultures of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal\\nfluid yielded no pathogenic microorganisms.\\nCefazolin, nystatin, gentamicin, and acyclovir were\\ngiven, without a definite response. The temperature\\nrose daily to 39.5°C.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. WALTER E. DONAT*: May we review the im-\\naging studies?\\nDR. THERESA C. MCLOUD: The CT examination of the lungs (Fig. 1) shows widespread nodules, 4 to\\n20 mm in diameter, especially in the bases; most of\\nthe nodules are ill defined, and some contain air\\nbronchograms. A section through the liver with\\ncontrast material reveals several focal, low-attenua-\\ntion lesions, less than 1 cm in diameter.\\nDR. DONAT: The differential diagnosis must in-\\nclude diseases that can explain involvement of the\\nlungs, liver, and peripheral nervous system, as well as\\nprobable involvement of the central nervous system.\\nThe skin lesions must be identified in the context of\\nthe patient's underlying disease.\\nHerpes zoster causes a unilateral vesicular erup-\\ntion in a dermatomal distribution associated with\\npain, pruritus, and low-grade fever. It can occur in\\nmiddle-aged adults who have no serious underlying\\ndisease. In immunocompromised patients, especially\\nthose with lymphomas or the acquired immunode-\\nficiency syndrome (AIDS), widespread dissemina-\\ntion and ulceration may occur. Visceral involvement\\ncan appear as pneumonia, hepatitis, myelitis, menin-\\ngitis, or encephalitis.¹ The characteristic radiologic\\nmanifestations of pneumonia due to herpes zoster\\nare numerous ill-defined nodules, 5 to 10 mm in di-\\nameter. Disseminated zoster could not have caused\\nthe visceral involvement in this case, however, be-\\ncause the pulmonary nodules and neurologic symp-\\ntoms preceded the rash.\\nThe causes of pulmonary nodules are shown in\\nTable 4.² Many of these conditions cannot account\\nfor this patient's multisystem involvement. For ex-\\nample, there are no symptoms or signs of a metastat-\\nic tumor. Moreover, cytologic examination of the as-\\npirate did not suggest a monomorphic infiltrate of\\ntumor cells. The markedly atypical mononuclear cells\\nobtained by needle aspiration suggested lymphoma.\\nLung parenchymal involvement by untreated Hodg-\\nkin's lymphoma is invariably associated with medias-\\ntinal lymph-node enlargement. The disease typically\\nspreads from one contiguous lymph-node group to\\nanother and would not involve the lungs and liver in\\nthe patchy pattern observed in this case. Also, fine-\\nneedle aspiration biopsy of extranodal sites has a\\nhigh diagnostic yield.4\\nIn contrast to the findings in patients with Hodg-\\nkin's disease, pulmonary parenchymal lesions with-\\nout mediastinal lymph-node enlargement are present\\nin 50 percent of patients with non-Hodgkin's lym-\\nphoma who have thoracic involvement.5 The angio-\\ntensin-converting enzyme level is low in the great\\nmajority of cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Ele-\\nvations of angiotensin-converting enzyme occur in\\nrare cases of Hodgkin's disease, histiocytic medullary\\nreticulosis, and certain peripheral T-cell lymphomas,\\nincluding Lennert's (lymphoepithelioid-cell) lym-\\nphoma.6,7\\nWas the white exudate on the patient's tonsil a\\nsign of oral candidiasis or lymphoma? Lennert's lym- phoma, a low-grade lymphoma of the post-thymic\\nT-cell type, is commonly associated with constitu-\\ntional symptoms, involvement of Waldeyer's ring,\\nlymphopenia, and severe hypoalbuminemia. Sites of\\nextranodal involvement include the liver, the spleen,\\nand in rare cases the lungs, but peripheral lymphad-\\nenopathy is always evident at presentation.8\\nThe extranodal distribution of this patient's dis-\\nease and the normal peripheral-blood smear, bone\\nmarrow examination, and skin biopsy rule out most\\nlymphomas except for angiocentric lymphomas, which\\nI will discuss later.\\nSome of the cells obtained by fine-needle aspi-\\nration suggested a low-grade adenocarcinoma. Bron-\\nchioloalveolar-cell carcinoma may have the radio-\\ngraphic appearance of multiple pulmonary nodules\\ncontaining air bronchograms. When there are many\\nill-defined nodules, however, bronchorrhea and cough\\nare common, although 20 percent of patients may\\nbe asymptomatic. In addition, there may be severe\\ndyspnea associated with hypoxemia and shunting\\nas a result of the growth of the tumor along the\\nalveolar surfaces. It is much more likely that the ab-\\nnormal cells observed in this case were type II pneu-\\nmocytes or bronchial epithelial cells that were re-\\nsponding to lung injury.\\nThe finding of a minute granuloma in the speci-\\nmen from the transbronchial lung biopsy raises the\\npossibility of tuberculosis or disseminated fungal in-\\nfection. However, the pulmonary radiographic find- ings characteristic of miliary tuberculosis are dissem-\\ninated nodules, 2 to 3 mm in diameter. Multiple\\nlarge nodules, or tuberculomas, most often represent\\nhealed infection and are frequently calcified. The\\nfinding of multiple hepatic nodules with a high se-\\nrum alkaline phosphatase level suggests granuloma-\\ntous hepatitis or a tuberculous or fungal infection.\\nThe liver is most often involved by disseminated mi-\\ncroscopical granulomas in cases of miliary tubercu-\\nlosis, but in rare cases, large tuberculous nodules or\\npseudotumors observed on imaging studies repre-\\nsent isolated manifestations of intraabdominal tu-\\nberculosis or indicate widely disseminated disease.10\\nMeningitis occurs with miliary tuberculosis but typ-\\nically causes pleocytosis. Moreover, peripheral neu-\\nropathy does not occur in untreated tuberculosis.\\nThe patient had a negative tuberculin skin test, al-\\nthough she was probably anergic.\\nThere is no history of travel that would suggest\\nhistoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis, both of which\\nmay cause pulmonary nodules, granulomatous hep-\\natitis, and meningitis. Opportunistic infection with\\ncryptococcus, aspergillus, or nocardia can present\\nwith nodular lesions in immunosuppressed hosts, but\\nfine-needle aspiration has a high diagnostic yield in\\nthese disorders,11 and none of these infections can\\naccount for the multiorgan involvement and tempo-\\nral evolution of findings in this case.\\nA low CD4+ count in a patient with a wasting ill-\\nness, thrush, fever, and peripheral neuropathy sug-\\ngests advanced AIDS. Nodular pulmonary lesions\\nin a patient with HIV infection may be due to lym-\\nphoma, tuberculosis, Kaposi's sarcoma, disseminated\\ncryptococcosis, or in rare cases, Pneumocystis carinii\\npneumonia or staphylococcal pneumonia.12 AIDS has\\nalso been associated with an elevation in the serum\\nangiotensin-converting enzyme level.13 The chance\\nof a false negative serologic test for HIV infection\\nis extremely low, however, and most often associat-\\ned with early infection or hypogammaglobulinemia.\\nThis patient did not have AIDS.14\\nLiebow15 included five lesions in the category of\\npulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis: typical Weg-\\nener's granulomatosis; limited angiitis and granulo-\\nmatosis, Wegener's type; lymphomatoid granuloma-\\ntosis; necrotizing sarcoid angiitis and granulomatosis;\\nand bronchocentric granulomatosis.16 Allergic angiitis\\nand granulomatosis were subsequently added to the\\ncategory.17 For the purpose of this discussion, I shall\\nfocus on Wegener's granulomatosis, necrotizing sar-\\ncoid granulomatosis and its relation to sarcoidosis,\\nand lymphomatoid granulomatosis and its relation to\\nlymphoma. Allergic angiitis and granulomatosis can\\nbe ruled out, as well as bronchocentric granulomato-\\nsis, because the patient did not have asthma, eosino-\\nphilia, or other manifestations of these disorders.\\nWegener's granulomatosis involves the upper res-\\npiratory tract and lungs and produces a focal necro- tizing glomerulonephritis. In the limited form of the\\ndisease, there is no evidence of glomerulonephritis\\nor upper respiratory tract involvement. The mean\\nage at onset is in the fifth decade, and the course\\nmay be acute or indolent. Although typical Wege-\\nner's granulomatosis is more common in men than\\nin women, the limited form is more common in\\nwomen. The clinical presentation varies, but 90 per-\\ncent of patients present with symptoms in the upper\\nor lower airways. Fever was the initial manifestation\\nin 23 percent of patients in two series.18,19\\nThe chest radiograph is abnormal at presentation\\nin 75 percent of the cases. Single or multiple nodules,\\nranging from 3 mm in diameter to large masses or in-\\nfiltrative lesions, are present in 62 percent.20 Other\\ncharacteristics include air bronchograms, cavitation,\\nand low-density necrotic centers on CT scanning.\\nNeurologic involvement is rare at presentation but\\neventually affects 22 to 34 percent of patients. The\\nmost frequent finding is peripheral neuropathy, espe-\\ncially mononeuropathy multiplex, which commonly\\ninvolves the peroneal and tibial nerves. Mixed motor\\nand sensory polyneuropathy also occurs. Central nerv-\\nous system involvement can be manifested as a stroke\\nor seizure due to cerebral vasculitis. Leptomeningeal\\ninvolvement, however, is exceedingly rare, and the el-\\nevated cerebrospinal fluid protein level and hypogly-\\ncorrhachia in this case are not consistent with the di-\\nagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.21\\nAmong the abnormal laboratory findings typical\\nof this disease is leukocytosis rather than leukopenia.\\nThe test for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\\nhas a sensitivity of 90 percent for active Wegener's\\ngranulomatosis, but in the limited form of the dis-\\nease, the test is positive in 60 to 70 percent of cas-\\nes. 18,22 Recent studies have shown a depression in the\\nCD4+ lymphocyte count and peripheral-lympho-\\ncyte subtyping similar to that seen in AIDS.23 The\\nangiotensin-converting-enzyme level was normal in\\nthe small number of cases of Wegener's granuloma-\\ntosis in which it has been reported.4,24\\nThe presence of multiple pulmonary nodules and\\nperipheral neuropathy, especially mononeuropathy\\nmultiplex, should suggest Wegener's granulomatosis,\\ndespite the negative test for antineutrophil cytoplas-\\nmic antibodies. The liver is seldom a major site of\\nclinical involvement in Wegener's granulomatosis, and\\nthere are no published reports of liver nodules on im-\\naging studies. The presence of hepatic nodules, the\\nmeningeal involvement, and the inconsistent labora-\\ntory values in this case argue against that diagnosis.\\nNecrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis can cause\\ncough, dyspnea, chest pain, and hemoptysis. Up to 25\\npercent of patients may be asymptomatic and present\\nonly with radiologic evidence of bilateral pulmonary\\nnodules. Hilar lymph-node involvement may be more\\ncommon than initially recognized.25,26 Extrathoracic\\nlesions are very rare, and the serum angiotensin-con- verting-enzyme level is only occasionally elevated.26\\nAlthough this disorder sounds ominous, the prog-\\nnosis is excellent with or without corticosteroid\\ntherapy; indeed, some observers have favored the\\nterm “nodular sarcoid granulomatosis” over “necro-\\ntizing sarcoid granulomatosis.”27,28 Vascular involve-\\nment, which is common in sarcoidosis, is unusually\\nsevere in necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis and was\\ninitially the basis for differentiating this entity from\\ntypical sarcoidosis. 29\\nThe presence of large pulmonary nodules is well\\ndocumented in sarcoidosis.30 In the pseudoalveolar\\nform, parenchymal granulomas become confluent\\nand compress air spaces and bronchi. On CT scan-\\nning, opacities, 1 to 4 cm in diameter, are located\\nalong bronchovascular bundles and in the subpleural\\nparenchyma; air bronchograms are common. Ground-\\nglass opacities may also be seen, reflecting the alveo-\\nlitis of sarcoidosis.31 In this case, however, the ab-\\nsence of bronchovascular beading or acinar rosettes\\nand enlarged hilar lymph nodes is strong evidence\\nagainst the diagnosis.\\nWhen sarcoidosis involves the liver, it is usually\\nmanifested as organomegaly, but a normal-size liver\\nwith multiple low-attenuation nodules on CT scan-\\nning is present in 5 to 15 percent of cases. In one\\nseries of 32 patients, all 32 also had splenic nod-\\nules.32 Intraabdominal and periportal lymphade-\\nnopathy was present in 78 percent of the patients.\\nThe serum angiotensin-converting-enzyme level was\\nmarkedly elevated an average of 2.5 times the up-\\nper limit of control values and distinguished nod-\\nular sarcoidosis from lymphoma involving the liver.\\nNeurologic manifestations occur in 5 percent of\\ncases of sarcoidosis. Cranial neuropathy is common,\\nbut peripheral neuropathy is rare. A chronic sensory\\nand motor polyneuropathy is most common, al-\\nthough mononeuropathy multiplex and chronic\\ninflammatory polyneuropathy resembling the Guil-\\nlain-Barré syndrome have also been reported. Lep-\\ntomeningeal sarcoidosis may be characterized only\\nby an elevated protein level and a slightly low glu-\\ncose level without pleocytosis. Also, meningeal in-\\nvolvement may be asymptomatic and accompany\\nother neurologic manifestations, such as peripheral\\nneuropathy or cranial neuropathy. 33,34\\nLaboratory abnormalities in patients with sar-\\ncoidosis may include leukopenia and lymphopenia.\\nThere is a decreased number of CD4+ helper cells\\nand a decreased ratio of CD4+ cells to CD8+ cells\\nin the blood.35 Hypergammaglobulinemia is present\\nin 50 percent of cases, but hypoalbuminemia is very\\nrare. The angiotensin-converting–enzyme level is el-\\nevated in 60 percent of patients, and the elevation is\\ncorrelated with the activity and extent of the disease,\\nbut it is not a specific marker of sarcoidosis.\\nAlthough sarcoidosis can have protean manifes-\\ntations with multisystem involvement, patients are rarely as ill as this woman appeared to be. Her skin\\ninvolvement is also difficult to explain. Herpes zoster\\nis infrequently associated with sarcoidosis, occurs in\\nthe inactive stage of the disease, and typically has a\\nbenign course. 36\\nLymphomatoid granulomatosis is an angiocentric\\nand angiodestructive infiltrating lesion composed of\\natypical lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes.\\nMany organs can be involved, including the lungs,\\nskin, liver, kidneys, and central and peripheral nerv-\\nous systems. 37-39 The lymph nodes, spleen, and bone\\nmarrow are spared until late in the course of the ill-\\nness, usually after its progression to lymphoma. The\\nhigh frequency of skin lesions, the central nervous\\nsystem involvement, and the absence of glomerulo-\\nnephritis distinguish this disorder from Wegener's\\ngranulomatosis. Benign lymphocytic angiitis with\\ngranulomatosis and angiocentric lymphoma proba-\\nbly represent the two ends of a spectrum of cytologic\\natypia and clinical aggressiveness. The term “angio-\\ncentric immunoproliferative lesion” has been pro-\\nposed to encompass these entities.40\\nThe primary presenting symptoms in patients\\nwith lymphomatoid granulomatosis include fever,\\ncough, weight loss, malaise, dyspnea, and neurologic\\nsymptoms. The disease presents in middle age, and\\nmen are affected more often than women. There is\\nfrequently an interval of many months from the on-\\nset of symptoms to the establishment of the diag-\\nnosis.\\nThe most common radiographic abnormality is\\nthe presence of bilateral pulmonary nodules with a\\nlower-lobe predominance and a tendency toward a\\nperipheral location. Hilar lymphadenopathy is rare.\\nCavitation is observed in 30 percent of cases. Air\\nbronchograms can be seen within the nodules, which\\nmay become confluent, with an infiltrative char-\\nacter.\\nPatients with lymphomatoid granulomatosis have a\\nnormal or slightly decreased hematocrit. Leukopenia\\nis observed in 20 percent of patients, and lymphope-\\nnia in 33 percent. The CD4+ lymphocyte count may\\nbe low.41 The erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be\\nnormal or elevated. Serum immunoglobulin levels\\nare most often normal, but the serum albumin level\\ncan be very low. Tests for rheumatoid factor and an-\\ntinuclear antibodies are infrequently positive. The se-\\nrum angiotensin-converting-enzyme level was nor-\\nmal or low in three reported cases.24\\nHepatic involvement is common at autopsy (29\\npercent)37 but is rarely clinically important. Hepato-\\nmegaly is found in approximately 12 percent of cas-\\nes.38 Neurologic manifestations, including mental-\\nstatus changes, ataxia, hemiparesis, and seizures, are\\npresent in 20 percent of patients at presentation and\\ndevelop in 30 percent during the course of the ill-\\nness. Cranial neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy\\noccur, with the latter characterized by paresthesias involving the legs. Mononeuropathy multiplex has\\nalso been reported.42 The nervous system lesions are\\ncharacterized by an extensive infiltration of lympho-\\ncytes and histiocytes in the meninges and cerebral\\nvessels, within the brain parenchyma, and along the\\ncourse of peripheral nerves.37\\nThe skin is involved in 40 to 45 percent of patients\\nand may be the presenting manifestation of the dis-\\nease. Erythematous macules, papules, and plaques\\nmay be seen over the gluteal areas and legs. Nodules,\\nwhich can occasionally ulcerate, may resemble ery-\\nthema nodosum but are more common over the\\ntrunk than over the arms and legs. The skin biopsy\\ncan be diagnostic, and immunofluorescence studies\\ndo not show cross-reactivity with herpesvirus anti-\\nbodies.43 Although the distribution of the skin le-\\nsions in this case was consistent with lymphomatoid\\ngranulomatosis, I favor a diagnosis of herpes zoster.\\nLymphomatoid granulomatosis progresses to an-\\ngiocentric lymphoma, a peripheral T-cell lymphoma,\\nin 13 to 45 percent of cases. The differentiation of\\nWegener's granulomatosis from lymphomatoid gran-\\nulomatosis requires a large tissue sample. A small but\\nadequate sample obtained by transbronchoscopic\\nlung biopsy usually suffices for the confirmation of\\nsarcoidosis, if the clinical picture is compatible. The\\npresence of granulomas is evidence against a diagno-\\nsis of lymphomatoid granulomatosis, however, since\\nsarcoid-like granulomas and multinucleated giant\\ncells are most often absent in this disorder. The sin-\\ngle granuloma in the biopsy specimen is nonspecific,\\nas are the multinucleated giant cells in the broncho-\\nalveolar-lavage specimen, because these cells can be\\nseen in the lungs of smokers.\\nOn the other hand, the findings on fine-needle as-\\npiration biopsy in this case are not consistent with\\nthe diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Microscopical granulo-\\nmas and multinucleated giant cells are ubiquitous in\\nnodular sarcoidosis and should have been present in\\nthe aspirated material. The atypical glandular cells\\nwould be unusual in aspirates obtained from sarcoid\\nlesions.44 Atypical epithelial cells and multinucleated\\ngiant cells can be seen in needle aspirates of necrotic\\nnodules in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis,\\nbut neutrophils and some eosinophils are typically\\npresent rather than mononuclear cells.45 The degen-\\nerated atypical mononuclear cells associated with\\nhighly reactive pneumocytes or epithelial cells indi-\\ncate that in this case, the aspiration-biopsy sample\\nwas obtained from an area of necrosis, which can\\npredominate in a pulmonary nodule in lymphoma-\\ntoid granulomatosis or angiocentric lymphoma.\\nIn view of the aggressive course of this disease and\\nthe cytologic atypia, I suspect that the diagnostic pro-\\ncedure was an open-lung biopsy. My diagnosis is\\nlymphomatoid granulomatosis or angiocentric lym-\\nphoma with involvement of the lungs, liver, lepto-\\nmeninges, and peripheral nerves.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\n? Lymphomatoid granulomatosis, ? bronchioloal-\\nveolar-cell carcinoma, ? sarcoidosis.\\n\\nDR. WALTER E. DONAT'S DIAGNOSES\\nLymphomatoid granulomatosis or angiocentric\\nlymphoma with involvement of the lungs, liver,\\nleptomeninges, and peripheral nerves.\\nHerpes zoster of the skin.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. ELENA SAVILO: The diagnostic procedure was\\nan open biopsy of the lower lobe of the left lung.\\nGross examination of the specimen showed several\\ndiscrete tan nodules. Microscopical examination re-\\nvealed multiple parenchymal and subpleural nodules\\ncomposed of pleomorphic, medium-to-large cells with\\nabundant, eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nu-\\ncleoli; mitoses were frequent. These cells surrounded\\nand infiltrated blood vessels and bronchioles and ex-\\npanded interalveolar septa (Fig. 2 and 3). These\\nfindings suggest lymphoma and are within the spec-\\ntrum of changes designated as lymphomatoid gran-\\nulomatosis.\\nThe tumor cells were immunocytochemically pos-\\nitive for leukocyte common antigen (CD45) and for\\nCD45RO (UCHL1), CD43, and CD2, which are\\nT-cell-associated antigens, and were negative for im-\\nmunoglobulin, B-cell-lineage antigens (CD19, CD20,\\nCD22, and L26), other T-cell-associated antigens\\n(CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, and CD8), and epithelial\\nmembrane antigen. In some areas, many cells were\\npositive for CD30 (Ki-1). Stains for Epstein-Barr vi-\\nrus nuclear antigen and latent membrane protein\\nwere negative. An in situ hybridization study for Ep-\\nstein-Barr virus was also negative.\\nOn the basis of the morphologic features and the\\npredominance of T cells, lesions previously described\\nas lymphomatoid vasculitis (skin lesions), lymphoma-\\ntoid granulomatosis (lesions in the lungs, central\\nnervous system, or kidneys), and midfacial lesions,\\nincluding lethal midline granuloma, polymorphic re-\\nticulosis, and midline malignant reticulosis, were ini-\\ntially considered to be biologically related entities of\\nthe T-cell phenotype.46,47 Recent studies, however,\\nsuggest that the pulmonary and midfacial lesions\\nmay be distinct diseases. The cells in nasal lesions have\\nfeatures of natural killer cells (large granular lym-\\nphocytes). They express natural-killer-cell markers\\n(CD16 and CD56), are positive for Epstein-Barr vi-\\nrus, and do not have rearrangements of the T-cell-\\nreceptor gene.48 In contrast, the large atypical cells\\nof pulmonary lymphomatoid granulomatosis have\\nbeen shown to be B cells containing Epstein-Barr\\nvirus sequences, and molecular genetic studies have\\ndemonstrated rearrangements of the immunoglobu-\\nlin gene in some cases.49 Thus, it has been suggested that the midfacial lesions are T-cell or natural-killer-\\ncell lymphomas, and the lesions of lymphomatoid\\ngranulomatosis are B-cell lymphomas related to Ep-\\nstein-Barr virus with a prominent T-cell reaction.\\nA recent study of 17 cases diagnosed as lym-\\nphomatoid granulomatosis involving the lungs50 il-\\nlustrates the complex nature of this disease. In 10 of\\nthe cases, there was double staining for the B-cell\\nmarker CD20 and Epstein-Barr virus RNA (by in\\nsitu hybridization), indicating a B-cell process; 1 of\\nthese cases involved a rearrangement of the immu-\\nnoglobulin gene. In three cases, however, the large\\ncells expressed T-cell markers and were negative for\\nEpstein-Barr virus. Thus, although most cases with\\nhistologic features of lymphomatoid granulomato-\\nsis appear to be B-cell lymphomas associated with\\nEpstein-Barr virus infection, a minority appear to be\\nT-cell lymphomas. It is not clear whether these\\nT-cell lymphomas are related to the nasal cases that\\ntend to be of natural-killer-cell origin and are posi-\\ntive for Epstein-Barr virus.\\nIn summary, this patient had a high-grade extra-\\nnodal T-cell lymphoma, which can be subclassified\\nas a CD30+, anaplastic, large-cell lymphoma. It is\\nwithin the spectrum of diseases described as lym-\\nphomatoid granulomatosis. However, recent data\\nsuggest that this term should be replaced by one that\\ndenotes a more specific subtype of lymphoma.\\n\\nADDENDUM\\nDR. SAVILO: After six cycles of chemotherapy\\nwith cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and\\nprednisone, the patient underwent restaging studies,\\nwhich revealed multiple liver nodules. Five months\\nafter the diagnosis, examination of a specimen from\\na CT-guided liver biopsy showed a recurrence of the\\nlymphoma. A review of the bone marrow-biopsy\\nspecimen from the other hospital showed a focus\\nconsistent with involvement by lymphoma.\",\n",
       " 'A 37-year-old right-handed man with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was admitted to the hospital because of increasing confusion and disorientation.\\nThe patient had tested positive for antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) several years earlier. Thirty-eight months before admission the CD4+ cell count was 200 per cubic millimeter, and zidovudine treatment was begun. Seven months later he was treated successfully for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Ten months before admission a disseminated varicella-zoster rash developed and was complicated by abdominal pain attributed to pancreatitis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, acyclovir, fluconazole, and rifampin were added to the treatment regimen. In the next month the CD4+ cell count was 16 per cubic millimeter.\\nOne month before admission the patient began to bump into objects on his right side; neurologic evaluation showed a right homonymous hemianopia. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed hypointensity on T₁-weighted images, hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, and swelling that involved the left midtemporal and inferior parietal gyri and subcortical white matter. Pyrimethamine, clindamycin, and leucovorin treatment was begun empirically. One week later the patient had a burning sensation in the chest and throat. An endoscopic examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain (Fig. 1), performed before and after the intravenous injection of contrast material, revealed hemorrhage in the left temporal, parietal, and posterior frontal lobes, with slight enhancement. During the next two weeks the patient became increasingly confused and agitated. He was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient\\'s medications on admission consisted of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, leucovorin, acyclovir, fluconazole, and pyrimethamine. There was no history of recent fever, contact with ill persons, invasive procedures, use of alcohol or illicit drugs, psychiatric disorders, seizures, loss of consciousness, or headache and no family history of neurologic disease.\\nThe temperature was 36.4°C, the pulse was 64, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 125/85 mm Hg. A general physical examination revealed oral thrush.\\nOn neurologic examination the patient was confused and agitated, with fluent speech; he refused to answer questions and demanded to be left alone. He could count only from one to five; he obeyed one-step commands but did not register the information. He calculated that two plus four equals two, and he showed his knee when asked to show his thumb. A dense right homonymous hemianopia was present; the patient resisted funduscopic examination. There was diminished sensation of light touch in all three divisions of the right trigeminal nerve. He moved all extremities symmetrically, and muscle tone was normal. Pinprick sensation was preserved; light touch was diminished in the right arm, trunk, and right leg. He neglected the right side on double simultaneous stimulation. The gait could not be tested. No dysmetria was detected on the finger-to-nose test. The deep-tendon reflexes were + + in the upper extremities and left lower extremity and +++ in the right lower extremity; a right Babinski sign was present. No frontal release signs were detected.\\nThe urine was normal. Laboratory tests were performed (Table 1). The blood chemical values, including enzyme values, were normal. A serologic test for syphilis was negative. An electrocardiogram disclosed a normal rhythm at a rate of 91, with an R-wave axis of +103 degrees, a P-wave axis of +82 degrees, and clockwise rotation. A radiograph of the chest was normal. A lumbar puncture was performed (Table 2).\\nPhenytoin, thiamine, and folic acid were added to the patient\\'s usual medications. Minidose heparin was injected subcutaneously, and haloperidol and lorazepam were injected intravenously for agitation. The patient remained confused and uncooperative and ate poorly. His temperature rose to 38.3°C on the third hospital day but was normal at other times. On the sixth hospital day a mild right hemiparesis was noted, and two days later a left ptosis was present without pupillary changes. A cardiac ultrasonographic study was normal. A blood test for cytomegalovirus antibody was positive (110 U on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay); tests for cryptococcal antigen, toxoplasma IgG antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody, and hepatitis C antibody were negative. Nine blood cultures and bacterial and fungal cultures of urine were sterile. A CT scan of the brain showed new areas of low attenuation and swelling of right-parietal-lobe gyri and subcortical white matter and new petechiae and edema in the left frontal and right temporal lobes. Microscopical examination of an open-biopsy specimen of the left parieto-occipital region revealed necrosis and gliosis consistent with infarction; examination with special stains, including immunohistochemical stains, disclosed no microorganisms. The possibility of vasculitis was raised.\\nOn the 12th hospital day a cranial MRI scan (Fig. 2, 3, and 4) showed hypointensity on T₁-weighted images, hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, petechiae, and swelling of most of the left temporal and parietal lobes, the left insula, and regions in both frontal lobes, the right parietal lobe, and the right temporal lobe, with slight associated gyral enhancement. T2-weighted hyperintensity was also seen in the left pons and the left thalamus.\\nThe patient\\'s condition deteriorated progressively, with the development of a urinary tract infection and intermittent fever. A neuro-ophthalmologic examination revealed no evidence of vasculitis or retinitis on the 21st hospital day. A percutaneous cerebral angiographic study revealed segmental narrowing of the supraclinoid portions of both internal carotid arteries at the proximal anterior cerebral arteries, the proximal and distal branches of the left middle cerebral artery, and the right posterior communicating artery; multiple regions of decreased parenchymal blush were noted in the right and left middle cerebral arterial distributions.\\nThe patient died on the 30th hospital day.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. STUART A. LIPTON*: The important features of this case are the presence of AIDS and the progressive, multifocal neurologic deficits. Parenchymal lesions were complicated by the development of hemorrhages in abnormal regions of hypointensity and enhancement shown on MRI scanning, first in the left midtemporal and inferior parietal gyri, but also in the subcortical white matter and later in the posterosuperior left frontal lobe. Neurologically, the patient presented with a visual-field deficit consisting of a right homonymous hemianopia compatible with the lesions in the left temporal and parietal lobes, as demonstrated with the imaging techniques. The patient then became confused and agitated, necessitating admission to this hospital and further investigation.\\nAlthough the patient had fluent speech, we have too little knowledge of his speech content, comprehension of yes-or-no questions, repetition of phrases, and ability to name objects to determine whether he had aphasia, as would be expected with a focal ischemic lesion in the left temporal or parietal lobe. The acalculia and finger agnosia raise the possibility of Gerstmann\\'s syndrome, a diagnosis consistent with a lesion in the left inferior parietal lobe. However, this syndrome cannot be diagnosed with certainty because the patient may not have been fully attentive or may not have fully comprehended the questions. Also, we have no information about other features of the syndrome, such as right-left confusion and agraphia.\\nThe diminished sensation of light touch on the right side of the face, right arm, trunk, and right leg is possibly consistent with his left parietal lesion, but the burning sensation in the throat and his neglect of double simultaneous stimulation on the right side may have reflected extension of the process into the left thalamus, as noted on a subsequent imaging study. The decrease in primary sensation may also account for the relative neglect of double simultaneous touch on the right side. Right-sided neglect in right-handed patients has been noted in Gerstmann\\'s syndrome, however, and that may be the explanation in this case; a left parietal lesion and disconnection of thalamocortical circuits could account for this finding.1-3 Another possible reason for the diminished sensation in the trigeminal distribution is his recent disseminated varicella-zoster infection, which could have affected the ophthalmic branch; this site of infection can facilitate viral entry into the central nervous system. The subsequent mild right hemiparesis is consistent with extension of the lesion into the left frontal lobe.\\nAn important question is whether the lesions shown on the CT and MRI scans fit into single vascular territories. May we therefore review the imaging studies?\\nDR. PAMELA W. SCHAEFER: The initial MRI images demonstrate diffuse T₁-weighted hypointensity, T2-weighted hyperintensity, and a mass effect involving the subcortical white matter and adjacent gray matter of the left temporal lobe. A CT scan without contrast enhancement (Fig. 1) obtained one week later demonstrates hemorrhage in the left temporal area of abnormality, with some extension into the left parietal and posterior frontal lobes. MRI scans (Fig. 2, 3, and 4) obtained on the 12th hospital day demonstrate multiple new regions of swelling, T₁-weighted hypointensity, T2-weighted hyperintensity, and hemorrhage involving subcortical white matter and adjacent gray matter. These lesions are in both temporal lobes, both occipital lobes, both parietal lobes, the left frontal lobe, and the left insular region. There are also new T2-weighted hyperintense lesions in the left pons and midbrain and the left thalamus.\\nDR. LIPTON: The lesions in the brain were therefore in both the gray and the white matter, were multifocal, and subsequently became hemorrhagic. On radiologic grounds the differential diagnosis includes multifocal infarcts and encephalitis.\\nApproximately a third of adult patients with AIDS eventually have decreased concentration or confusion and predominantly nonfocal cognitive and motor deficits, known as the AIDS dementia complex4 or the HIV-1-associated cognitive-motor complex. This disorder occurs in the absence of the superinfections or malignant tumors that complicate AIDS and is apparently associated with neurotoxins released from HIV-1-infected or -activated macrophages and microglia in the brain.5 However, this diagnosis is partly one of exclusion, and the multifocal nature of the clinical deficits in this case is more suggestive of vascular complications, superinfection, or a neoplasm.\\nA number of superinfections with opportunistic organisms occur in the central nervous system of immunocompromised patients, including those with AIDS, and several can cause focal neurologic signs (Table 3). In addition, Lyme disease, although not necessarily more frequent in HIV-1-infected patients, is indigenous to this part of the United States, and a negative test might have been useful to rule out that disorder.\\nSeveral of these diagnoses are unlikely in this case, in view of the clinical presentation, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and imaging studies. In the absence of CT evidence of calcified abscesses, toxoplasmosis is unlikely. Typical manifestations of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy include hemiparesis, aphasia, visual-field defects, and confusional states. Demyelinated lesions in the cerebral hemispheres and abnormal reactive and gigantic astrocytes were not observed, however, in the open-biopsy specimen of the brain, and the detection of JC virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was not reported, making the diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy unlikely. Similarly, there was no serologic, cerebrospinal fluid, microbiologic, or biopsy evidence of syphilitic, fungal, or acid-fast bacillary infection.\\nIn patients with AIDS, neurologic manifestations due to a metabolic encephalopathy or other infections are primarily nonfocal in their presentation. They include HIV-1-related encephalitis, cytomegalovirus encephalitis, and herpes simplex virus encephalitis, although the last can also produce focal signs. Many patients without central nervous system symptoms of cytomegalovirus infection have positive antibody titers in the blood, as did this patient, and recent evidence suggests that a PCR assay of the cerebrospinal fluid is a more specific test for disease of the nervous system. Although these disorders cannot be ruled out in this case, the predominantly focal nature of the deficits argues against them.\\nOther neurologic complications in patients with HIV-1 infection that produce focal or multifocal signs are cerebral hemorrhages due to thrombocytopenia and nonbacterial endocarditis. In this case they cannot be diagnosed, since the platelet count is not given and the echocardiographic study was normal. In some patients with AIDS the cause of evolving hemiparesis, hemianopia, and aphasia is unclear, and the disorder has been interpreted as a pathologically distinct form of HIV-1-associated encephalopathy, which sometimes resembles subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy.” In addition, primary central nervous system lymphoma, metastatic systemic lymphoma, and metastatic Kaposi\\'s sarcoma must be considered in patients with AIDS. The biopsy in this case failed to reveal a neoplasm, and this diagnosis will not be considered further.\\nFinally, the multifocal vascular nature of the clinical presentation and the cerebral angiographic evidence suggesting widespread segmental narrowing and multiple regions of decreased parenchymal blush raise the possibility of noninflammatory vasculopathy or arteritis, a diagnosis that is consistent with the brain-biopsy findings. The ischemic necrosis and gliosis in the biopsy specimen, the multiple foci of T₁-weighted hypointensity and T2-weighted hyperintensity, edema, and hemorrhage with slight gyral enhancement shown on the MRI scan, and the angiographic findings all suggest the diagnosis of a noninflammatory vasculopathy or vasculitis, of which there are a number of forms. In drug addicts with AIDS, arteritis may be due to cocaine or amphetamine abuse. There was no history of illicit-drug abuse in this case, and special consideration must therefore be given to opportunistic superinfections that can be associated with a noninflammatory vasculopathy or vasculitis and that present clinically with cerebral infarction or hemorrhage (Table 4).\\nThe hematogenous spread of toxoplasma or aspergillus or other fungi can result in a picture resembling that of vasculitis. Toxoplasma can invade and spread along segments of small-artery walls, producing intimal thickening and thrombosis. Diagnosis by immunostaining of brain-biopsy specimens and a rapid response to chemotherapy, including sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine, distinguish that entity from the disorder in this case. Aspergillus as well as other fungi, including those of the order Mucorales and the genera bipolaris and exserohilum, can invade blood vessels, resulting in ischemic or hemorrhagic infarction with focal clinical deficits.10-13 At autopsy, aspergillus arteritis has been noted to have caused cerebral hemorrhage.14 Cerebral aspergillosis is usually associated with pulmonary infection, of which there was no evidence in this case. Also, aspergillus hyphae were not seen in the brain-biopsy specimen.\\nIn other reported cases of cerebral vasculitis in patients with AIDS, the lesions have been interpreted as caused by HIV-1 itself, as primary cerebral granulomatous angiitis, or as of unknown cause.15-22 Generally, the angiitis has been discovered at autopsy in adults or children with neurologic symptoms attributed to stroke, either ischemic or hemorrhagic. Also, cerebral vasculitis has been reported to be more frequent in HIV-1-seropositive patients without AIDS who are drug abusers than in a control group of seronegative drug abusers,23,24 but the cause of these central nervous system changes in HIV-1 infection is unclear. Rarely, cerebral vasculitis in patients with AIDS is associated with granulomatous amebic encephalitis,25 trypanosomiasis with necrotizing encephalitis,26 or cat scratch-related encephalitis due to Rochalimaea henselae.27 No factors predisposing the patient to any of these infections were present, however.\\nRecent reports have emphasized the possible association of the herpes family of viruses with cerebral vasculitis, which, it has been suggested, occurs with ocular herpes simplex infection28 and with cytomegalovirus infection.29 The well-known gastrointestinal vasculitis of cytomegalovirus infection can be accompanied by retinitis (even in the absence of suggestive findings on ophthalmologic examination, as in this case), encephalitis, and occlusive cerebral arteritis.30 Also, cerebral and ocular vasculitis can complicate cytomegalovirus infection in immunocompromised patients in the absence of systemic symptoms.31\\nIn this case the history of a disseminated varicella-zoster rash before admission suggests the possible implication of this virus. Varicella-zoster has been associated with multifocal leukoencephalitis and ventriculitis, with vasculopathy causing cerebral infarcts, and with necrotizing cerebral vasculitis, probably of hematogenous origin. 32-34 Both children and adults with AIDS have been reported, albeit rarely, to have multiple ischemic or hemorrhagic infarcts due to central nervous system vasculitis, probably resulting from a varicella-zoster virus infection that persisted because of an immunodeficient state.35 Rarely, varicella-zoster angiitis is associated with the formation of a mycotic aneurysm, followed by rupture and hemorrhage.36 Examination of leptomeningeal vessels can reveal a zoster-induced vasculopathy, and in addition to infarction and hemiplegia from cerebral vasculitis, demyelinated lesions similar to those of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy have been described in the cerebral white matter.37 In such cases, evidence of vascular and parenchymal central nervous system infection with varicella-zoster virus was found.\\nIn summary, I believe that this patient had leukoencephalitis and either a noninflammatory vasculopathy or vasculitis due to varicella-zoster virus infection, with multiple ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebral infarcts despite treatment with acyclovir. The diagnosis raises the possibility of direct viral invasion of vessel walls from neighboring nerves, but the delay in onset and the vasculitic nature of the lesions are also consistent with an immunopathologic or allergic reaction during convalescence from the infection. Even if viral protein, viral particles, or the viral genome were demonstrated to be present in the walls of the damaged cerebral vessels, as I suspect they could be, they might also have been present in the leptomeninges and brain parenchyma. That finding would raise the possibility, at least in some cases, of an indirect pathogenesis – through cerebrospinal fluid pathways, for example.32\\nFinally, lesions due to multiple agents are not unusual in patients with AIDS. The arterial changes associated with varicella-zoster virus infection can resemble the endarteritis obliterans found in several forms of chronic meningitis, including those due to syphilis and tuberculosis.32 Nonetheless, the absence of evidence of these other central nervous system infections leads me to favor the diagnosis of varicella-zoster virus infection in this case. Moreover, a synergism between HIV and varicella-zoster virus infection has been suggested by Gilden et al.38 Gray et al.32 observed multinucleated giant cells containing HIV proteins in their cytoplasm and Cowdry type A inclusion bodies in their nuclei in cases of varicella-zoster virus infection of the nervous system. In the absence of evidence of varicella-zoster virus infection, one would have to consider the diagnosis of cerebrovasculitis associated with HIV-1 itself.\\nAt autopsy the diagnosis of varicella-zoster virus infection could have been confirmed by immunocytochemical examination, by in situ hybridization, and by a PCR study of the arteries. An elevated titer of antibodies to varicella-zoster virus might have been found in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. PCR analysis of varicella-zoster virus DNA extracted from the cerebrospinal fluid could have rapidly confirmed the diagnosis, 39 and elevated IgG indexes might have also been found in the cerebrospinal fluid. Cells might have been encountered with Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusions that stained immunocytochemically for varicella-zoster virus, with herpesvirus nucleocapsids detected on electron-microscopical examination.\\nDR. RAYMOND D. ADAMS: The brusqueness of the onset, the temporary plateau of the symptoms, and the bilateral gray-matter and white-matter lesions in a vascular pattern favor the diagnosis of a vascular rather than a viral or neoplastic lesion. The hemorrhagic nature of the infarcts suggests the possibility that a carotid arteritis gave rise to emboli.\\nDR. LIPTON: Although it is true that the hemorrhage appeared to occur in preexisting infarcts, Amlie-Lefond et al.40 emphasized that multifocal ischemic and hemorrhagic infarction suggests the possibility of varicella-zoster encephalitis with either large-vessel or small-vessel arteritis. The small-vessel vasculopathy can lead to demyelination, whereas occlusion of large vessels leads to infarction, and the combination of ischemic and demyelinative lesions suggests varicella-zoster virus infection.40\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nHemorrhagic multifocal leukoencephalopathy, with hemorrhagic infarcts, possibly due to toxoplasmosis.\\nDR. STUART A. LIPTON\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nMultifocal leukoencephalitis, with occlusive noninflammatory vasculopathy or arteritis and hemorrhage, associated with varicella-zoster virus infection.\\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. M. JOE MA: An autopsy was limited to the brain, which weighed 1420 g. Coronal sections revealed multiple round-to-oval, discrete and confluent, well-demarcated, translucent areas, 2 to 10 mm in diameter, in the cerebral white matter and along the corticomedullary junction (Fig. 5). Some larger lesions had a target-like appearance, with granular, hemorrhagic centers. Subcortical areas of both temporal lobes contained multiple irregular foci of recent hemorrhage (Fig. 5). The left putamen and claustrum were included in one of the hemorrhagic lesions. Another hemorrhagic lesion extended from the midbrain to the pons.\\nMicroscopical examination showed necrotic centers in the white-matter lesions, surrounded by sheets of lipid-laden macrophages, paucicellular zones of myelin loss and vacuolation (Fig. 6), and small blood vessels lined by proliferative endothelial cells. Some of the reactive astrocytes with enlarged, optically clear nuclei contained eosinophilic intranuclear viral inclusion bodies with clear halos (Cowdry type A inclusions) (Fig. 7, left-hand panel). Viral inclusions were also found in many cortical neurons and occasional macrophages. Rare cytoplasmic viral inclusions were found in infected cells (Fig. 7, right-hand panel). Immunohistochemical staining for varicella-zoster viral antigens was positive in these inclusions. The presence of genomic DNA specific for varicella-zoster virus in paraffin-embedded tissue was confirmed by PCR.41 Examination of the proximal left middle cerebral artery showed focal, eccentric spindle-cell hyperplasia of the intima, causing mild-to-moderate luminal stenosis. The nucleus and cytoplasm of some of the intimal spindle cells in major cerebral arteries were immunoreactive with varicella-zoster virus antibody (Fig. 8). Ultrastructurally, the viral inclusions in glial cells contained many hexagonal nucleocapsids, 90 to 100 nm in diameter, characteristic of human herpesvirus. Silver impregnation by the Bodian method showed relative sparing of axons in the peripheral zone of myelin pallor. Staining for toxoplasma organisms, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, and HIV was negative. Retrospective attempts to identify varicella-zoster virus antigens and DNA in this case were unsuccessful because the biopsy specimens were too small.\\nThe neuropathology of varicella-zoster encephalitis and vasculopathy has recently been reviewed.32,40 The demonstration of varicella-zoster virus antigens in brain-biopsy specimens and DNA in cerebrospinal fluid42 and the culture of varicella-zoster virus43 have been reported. Examination of small biopsy specimens may reveal only nonspecific changes, and the sensitivity of virus-specific tests may be reduced owing to a limited amount of available tissue. Specimens from the edges of lesions are more likely to contain viral inclusions. The diagnosis is important, because effective therapy for varicella-zoster virus infection is available. To date, postmortem evaluation remains the basis of diagnosis in most cases.\\nTarget-like lesions with central necrosis and surrounding myelin pallor and Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusions in surrounding glia and neurons are the pathological hallmarks of varicella-zoster multifocal leukoencephalitis.32 Cowdry type A inclusions are virtually specific for herpesviruses, but their absence does not rule out subtle infections. Sensitive, specific diagnostic tests, such as immunohistochemical localization of viral antigens and in situ hybridization or PCR detection of viral DNA, are required for the unequivocal demonstration of virus-specific antigens or nucleic acids. The same techniques have also been used in testing samples of cerebrospinal fluid, with variable success.42\\nSeveral mechanisms for the development of varicella-zoster leukoencephalopathy have been proposed, including hematogenous or transneural spread40 and an immune-mediated mechanism. 44 The finding of an active \"centrifugal wave\" of infection at the periphery of lesions and their random distribution in the brain are most consistent with a hematogenous spread during viremia. Both noninflammatory vasculopathy and vasculitis have been associated with varicella-zoster virus infection. 37,45-48 The former involves mainly large cerebral arteries with noninflammatory hyperplasia of intima and media, sometimes resulting in thrombosis and ischemic infarction,37,45,46 whereas the latter involves mainly small vessels with fibrinoid necrosis and inflammatory infiltrates with thrombosis and hemorrhage.40,47,48\\nPetechiae, necrosis, and edema of the brain are common in herpes simplex virus encephalitis. However, important degrees of intracerebral hemorrhage, as were seen in this case, are more often associated with varicella-zoster leukoencephalitis.49\\nDR. LIPTON: Only the proximal left middle cerebral artery was examined at autopsy. Moreover, an in situ PCR examination of the blood vessels for the presence of the varicella-zoster virus could not be performed. Therefore, it is possible that there were areas of arteritis as suggested on the angiogram. In addition, owing to the temporal sequence of the disease, vasculitis may already have subsided by the time of death.',\n",
