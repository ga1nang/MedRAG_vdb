The patient is a Sudanese refugee living in a camp in the region. She denies any contact with sick people. Clinical Findings The patient is prostrate and semiconscious on admission. Vital signs: temperature 39.6°C, (103.3°F) blood pressure 90/60mmHg, pulse 90 bpm, and respiratory rate 24 cycles per minute. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness, especially in the right upper quadrant, hepatosplenomegaly and bleeding from the gums. The lungs were clear.

    "\"Discussion: This patient was seen during an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in northern Uganda, so the diagnosis was strongly suspected. She was admitted to the isolation ward that had been established as part of the international outbreak response. No clinical laboratory data were available because, for biosafety reasons, such testing was suspended. Although it is a reasonable precaution, the suspension of routine testing often causes difficulty in ruling out the many other febrile syndromes in the differential diagnosis and increases mortality from other non-Ebola disease. Fortunately, many clinical laboratory tests can now be safely performed with point-of-care instruments, often brought into a specialized laboratory in the isolation ward, as long as the laboratory personnel are properly trained and equipped. Answer to Question 1 Is the Patient’s History and Clinical Presentation Consistent with an HF Syndrome? The clinical presentation is indeed one of classic viral HF. However, most times the diagnosis is not so easy. Although some patients, such as this one, do progress to the classic syndrome with haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and shock, haemorrhage is not invariably seen (and may even be noted in only a minority of cases with some virus species), and severe and fatal disease may still occur in its absence. The clinical presentation of viral HF is often very non-specific. Furthermore, haemorrhage may be seen in numerous other syndromes, such as complicated malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis and leptospirosis, which are the primary differential diagnoses, depending on the region. Answer to Question 2 What Degree of Nursing Precautions Needs to be Implemented? The spread of Ebola virus between humans is through direct contact with blood or bodily fluids. Secondary attack rates are generally 15% to 20% during outbreaks in Africa, and much lower if proper universal precautions are maintained. Specialized viral HF precautions and personal protective equipment are warranted when there is a confirmed case or high index of suspicion, such as in this case.\\n\" \\\n",
