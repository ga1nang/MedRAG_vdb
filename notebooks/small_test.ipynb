      "\n",
      "*   **Travel History:** The patient's recent travel to Tây Ninh Province, Vietnam, is a significant risk factor for Ebola.\n",
      "*   **Symptoms:** The patient presents with fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and night sweats, which are common symptoms of Ebola.\n",
      "*   **Physical Exam:** Crackles over the right upper lobe could indicate pneumonia, which can be a complication of Ebola.\n",
      "*   **Laboratory Findings:** The elevated WBC count and the patient's age are consistent with Ebola.\n",
      "*   **Imaging:** The chest X-ray showing a cavitary lesion is also consistent with Ebola.\n",
      "\n",
      "While other conditions could present with some of these symptoms, the combination of travel history, symptoms, and physical exam findings strongly points towards Ebola.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   This is a preliminary diagnosis based on limited information. A definitive diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation (e.g., Ebola virus testing).\n",
      "*   Other conditions, such as other viral hemorrhagic fevers (e.g., Marburg, Lassa), should be considered and ruled out.\n",
      "*   The patient's history of pulmonary tuberculosis is relevant, but less likely to be the primary cause of the current symptoms.\n",
      "*   The patient's smoking history is a risk factor for various respiratory illnesses, but less directly related to the current presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Laboratory Confirmation:** Perform Ebola virus testing on blood samples.\n",
      "2.  **Contact Tracing:** Identify and monitor individuals who may have been exposed to the patient.\n",
      "3.  **Isolation:** Isolate the patient to prevent further spread of the virus.\n",
      "4.  **Supportive Care:** Provide supportive care, including fluid and electrolyte replacement, and management of complications.\n",
      "5.  **Public Health Measures:** Implement public health measures to control the outbreak, such as contact tracing, quarantine, and vaccination.\n",
