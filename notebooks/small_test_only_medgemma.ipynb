Four months before admission he had been\\ntransferred to this hospital because of acute bacterial\\nendocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, with\\naortic regurgitation. A test for antibodies to the hu-\\nman immunodeficiency virus was negative. A trans-\\nesophageal ultrasonographic examination of the\\nheart (Fig. 1) revealed a large prolapsing vegetation\\non the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve, with\\nsevere aortic regurgitation; there was a small mobile\\nvegetation on the septal leaflet, associated with mod-\\nerate tricuspid regurgitation. Oxacillin, gentamicin,\\nceftriaxone, and metronidazole were administered.\\nA computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain\\nshowed three enhancing foci, each less than 1 cm in\\ndiameter, in the subcortical white matter, a finding\\nconsistent with septic embolism. An abdominal CT\\nscan showed multiple splenic infarcts and probable\\nfocal infarction or necrosis of an ileal loop, with per-\\nforation. The infarcted, perforated segment of termi-\\nnal ileum and the infarcted spleen were resected, and\\na pelvic abscess was drained. Subsequently, the aortic\\nvalve and a large vegetation were excised (Fig. 2),\\nand a Carpentier-Edwards prosthetic pericardial valve\\nwas inserted; an adjacent abscess and a vegetation on\\nthe septum near the tricuspid valve were débrided.\\nThe patient was discharged, free of symptoms, on the\\n46th hospital day, after having received oxacillin intra-\\nvenously for 42 days; warfarin therapy was continued.\\nFive weeks after discharge, a low-grade fever devel-\\noped, with occasional chest pain, cough, chilliness,\\nFigure 1.

The left atrium and ventricle\\nwere dilated but without wall-motion abnormalities.\\nThe left ventricular ejection fraction was 59 percent.\\nThe prosthetic aortic valve was stable, with a peak\\ntransvalvular gradient of 18 mm Hg. There was se-\\nvere tricuspid regurgitation. The right ventricular\\nsystolic pressure was estimated to be 58 mm Hg.\\nRight ventricular systolic function was normal, and\\nno vegetations were seen on the valves.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. PATRICK T. O'GARA*: Dr. Weyman, may we\\nreview the echocardiographic studies?\\nDR. ARTHUR E. WEYMAN: The first transesopha-\\ngeal echocardiogram (Fig. 1) shows a large echogenic\\nmass attached to the aortic valve, predominantly in-\\nvolving the right coronary cusp but lying very close\\nto the orifice of the left coronary artery as the valve\\nopens. There is also a separation between the layers\\nof the wall of the aortic root, a finding consistent\\nwith the presence of a small abscess. An echogenic\\nmass on the base of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid\\nvalve is consistent with the spread of infection to the\\nright side of the heart.\\nThe second transesophageal echocardiogram (Fig.\\n2), obtained after replacement of the aortic valve,\\nshows normal opening and closing of the prosthetic\\nvalve; the tricuspid valve is free of vegetation. There\\nis severe prolapse of the anterior leaflet of the mitral\\nvalve, with malcoaptation and moderate-to-severe\\ninsufficiency of flow. The anterolateral papillary mus-\\ncle appears much longer than on the previous exam-\\nination, reaching almost to the tip of the mitral-valve\\nleaflet. It does not contract, and its head is connected\\nto the myocardium by a long, thin stalk. At the base\\nof the papillary muscle the contraction of the myo-\\ncardium is normal.\\nDR. O'GARA: Infective endocarditis occurs in 2 to\\n5 percent of intravenous drug abusers each year, a fre-\\nquency far exceeding that in patients with rheumatic\\nheart disease or prosthetic valves. 1,2 Most of the\\nreported cases are in men, and the age at presentation\\nis usually in the third or fourth decade.3 S. aureus is\\nthe causative organism in more than half the cases and\\nin more than 70 percent of cases involving the tricus-\\npid valve.4 Not more than 20 to 25 percent of patients\\nhave preexisting valvular or congenital heart dis-\\nease.4,5 The mechanism by which certain virulent or-\\nganisms, such as S. aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae,\\ninfect structurally normal valves without apparent\\nantecedent endothelial damage remains unknown.\\nRepeated injections of foreign material may trauma-\\ntize the tricuspid valve, or immunologic phenomena\\nmay cause nonspecific valvulitis.4,6 The clinical man-\\nifestations of infective endocarditis in intravenous\\ndrug abusers depend on the valve (or valves) infected\\nand, to a lesser extent, on the causative organism.\\nThe manifestations are similar to those observed in\\npersons with native-valve infective endocarditis who\\nare not abusing drugs.\\nEvidence of septic pulmonary emboli can be\\nfound in as many as 75 percent of patients with in-\\nvolvement of the tricuspid valve, and systemic emboli\\nare apparent in as many as 40 percent of patients\\nwith involvement of left-sided valves.4,5,7 Cerebral,\\ncoronary, and mesenteric arterial emboli may never-\\ntheless elude clinical detection. Embolism may be\\nmore frequent when S. aureus is the infectious\\nagent. Relapse of an initial infection with S. aureus\\nusually suggests that primary therapy was inadequate,\\nbut intravenous drug abuse is the most common risk\\nfactor for recurrence.9\\nMany of the symptoms reported by this patient\\nbefore his current hospital admission raise the pos-\\nsibility that he had an infection of the tricuspid\\nvalve with septic pulmonary emboli or transient\\nbacteremia, either of which can be related to intra-\\nvenous drug abuse. This possibility was not verified,\\nhowever, by subsequent clinical, radiographic, and\\nlaboratory data. The patient's clinical improvement\\nafter treatment for pulmonary edema suggests that\\nthe edema may have caused most or all of his symp-\\ntoms at that point. A more detailed description of\\nthe chest pain would have been useful in the light\\nof later concern about the integrity of the mitral-\\nvalve apparatus. Chest pain may have been a marker\\nfor either papillary-muscle infarction or chordal\\nrupture.\\nClinicians caring for patients in whom heart fail-\\nure develops after valve replacement must remain\\nvigilant for signs of prosthetic-valve dysfunction.\\nPrimary structural degeneration of the Carpentier-\\nEdwards pericardial-valve prosthesis within the time\\nframe reported in this case would have been very\\nunlikely. More pertinent areas of concern, alone or\\nin combination, would have been destruction of the\\nleaflet of the prosthesis, paravalvular regurgitation,\\nor dehiscence of the sewing ring due to residual or\\nrecurrent infection, inadequate tissue integrity at the\\ntime of the initial operation, or an improper suturing\\ntechnique. The risk of prosthetic-valve endocarditis\\nis highest within the first six months after surgery,\\nparticularly the first six weeks; the risk is increased\\nin patients with a history of native-valve endocar-\\nditis. 10,11 Prosthetic-valve endocarditis of early onset,\\ndefined as developing within 60 days after surgery,\\nusually results from nosocomial infection, whereas\\nendocarditis of later onset is more commonly due to\\nVolume 339 Number 7 461\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Coagulase-negative\\nstaphylococci, most of which are S. epidermidis, are\\nthe most common causes of early-onset prosthetic-\\nvalve endocarditis, although S. aureus, diphtheroids,\\ngram-negative bacilli, and fungi have also been im-\\nplicated. There is a high frequency of methicillin\\nresistance among strains of coagulase-negative staph-\\nylococci, commensurate with their nosocomial ori-\\ngin. Involvement of the prosthetic aortic valve and\\ninfection within the first postoperative year impart\\nan increased risk of local tissue invasion. Dysfunc-\\ntion of the prosthetic valve was not observed in this\\npatient.\\nSeveral well-described subaortic complications of\\naortic-valve infective endocarditis, seen particularly\\nwith infection by S. aureus, were not observed in\\nthis patient.5,12-14 These include extension of the in-\\nfection from the left or noncoronary aortic-valve\\ncusp into the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa,\\nresulting in abscess formation, aneurysm, or fistu-\\nlous perforation into the left atrium or pericardial\\nspace; transport of infective vegetative material along\\nthe aortic regurgitant stream onto the subjacent an-\\nterior leaflet of the mitral valve, with formation of\\nan aneurysm or fistulous perforation; similar delivery\\nof septic material onto the chordae tendineae, with\\nerosion and rupture; extension of the infection from\\nthe right or noncoronary cusp beyond the annulus,\\nwith involvement of the conduction system, produc-\\ning varying degrees of atrioventricular or left bundle-\\nbranch block; extension from the right coronary\\ncusp to the region of the membranous interventric-\\nular septum, with rupture into the right ventricle;\\nand periannular burrowing, with the creation of aor-\\ntocameral fistulas, usually involving the right atrium\\nor right ventricle. Transesophageal echocardiographic\\ndemonstration of one or more of the first three\\ncomplications would have provided a plausible ex-\\nplanation for the mitral regurgitation observed in this\\npatient. A well-performed transesophageal echocar-\\ndiographic study should have detected either in-\\nvolvement of the intervalvular fibrosa or an acquired\\nlesion of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet. However,\\nthis technique can overlook limited chordal rupture\\nor erosion, which in some cases is confirmed only at\\nsurgery or autopsy.\\nMitral regurgitation can result from anatomical or\\nfunctional impairment of the mitral-valve apparatus\\nat one or more of its four major components: the\\nleaflets, the annulus, the chordae tendineae, and the\\npapillary muscles and contiguous left ventricular\\nmyocardium. The mechanism of the mitral-valve\\nregurgitation in this patient is clearly defined by the\\nserial echocardiographic studies. They demonstrate\\nprolapse (abnormal superior and posterior systolic\\ndisplacement beyond the annular plane) of at least\\nthe lateral half of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet,\\nleading to malcoaptation of the leaflet and regurgi-\\ntation. Mitral-valve prolapse is most commonly asso-\\nciated with myxomatous changes within the spongiosa\\nof the valve, resulting in thickening and redundancy,\\nalong with elongation of the chordae and dilatation\\nof the annulus. Such valvular changes were not ob-\\nserved in this patient.\\nThe later echocardiographic studies suggest mild,\\ndiffuse thickening of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet,\\nwhich may reflect a nonspecific postinflammatory\\nchange in the architecture of the leaflet.15 Mitral-\\nvalve prolapse has been described in patients with\\nenlargement of structures of the right side of the\\nheart. In Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve or\\nin an atrial septal ostium secundum defect, for exam-\\nple, the left ventricular chamber becomes distorted\\nand smaller, resulting in an excess of mitral-valve\\ntissue relative to the reduced ventricular volume.16\\nHowever, the right ventricular enlargement that de-\\nveloped in this patient was only slight and probably\\ndid not cause the observed prolapse. Mitral-valve\\nprolapse may also coexist with rheumatic mitral-\\nvalve disease and with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\\nas a result of abnormal positioning of the papillary\\nmuscles, but neither of these disorders is pertinent\\nto this case.17 Mitral-valve prolapse has developed in\\nsome patients after myocardial infarction, possibly in\\nrelation to papillary-muscle dysfunction.18\\nThe transesophageal echocardiographic study per-\\nformed during this patient's second hospitalization\\ndemonstrated elongation of the papillary muscle with\\nexaggerated systolic excursion toward the mitral-valve\\nannulus during systole and a reduction in the nor-\\nmal distance between the head of the anterolateral\\npapillary muscle and the plane of the annulus.18 The\\nelongation might suggest abnormal stretching of the\\nmuscle, as if it were extending superiorly rather than\\ncontracting apically, or thinning of the muscle due\\nto necrosis and tissue loss. At issue is whether such\\nabnormal movement, which has been clearly delin-\\neated in patients with typical mitral-valve prolapse in\\nthe setting of myxomatous thickening, is due pri-\\nmarily to chordae-leaflet derangement, papillary-\\nmuscle dysfunction, or both.18 Chordal rupture with\\npartial leaflet flail would be expected to cause ever-\\nsion of the affected portion of the leaflet into the left\\natrium.19 In the current case, the echocardiographic\\nimages suggest instead that the lateral half of the an-\\nterior leaflet rises above and somewhat parallel to\\nthe annular plane, without such marked angulation\\ntoward the left atrium. Loss of chordal attachment\\nwould not allow the superior traction on the papil-\\nlary muscle that is seen with typical leaflet prolapse.\\nOur attention must shift, then, to the papillary mus-\\ncle and to processes than can interfere with its con-\\ntribution to the integrity of the mitral apparatus.\\nContractile dysfunction of the papillary muscle\\ncan result from ischemia, infarction, infection (with\\nabscess), infiltration (amyloidosis or sarcoidosis), or\\n462\\nAugust 13, 1998\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Edwards37\\nhad previously reported a case of fatal rupture of the\\nanterolateral papillary muscle due to coronary em-\\nbolism in a patient who had aortic-valve infective\\nendocarditis without apparent involvement of the\\nmitral leaflet or chordae.\\nThe nature and temporal evolution of this patient's\\nmitral regurgitation suggest that the inciting event\\nwas a subclinical insult to the anterolateral papillary\\nmuscle, possibly due to small-vessel embolism from\\nthe infective endocarditis of the aortic valve. The he-\\nmodynamic changes may have caused further injury,\\nand the severe aortic regurgitation may have reduced\\nperfusion pressure. Cardiac surgery would impose\\nthe additional stress of ischemia and reperfusion.\\nTissue necrosis and impairment of wound healing\\nwould explain the observed elongation, dysfunction,\\nand abnormal movement of the papillary muscle,\\nwhich eventually resulted in prolapse of the leaflet\\nand progressively more severe regurgitation. Chordal\\nrupture or erosion may have contributed to this\\nprocess but does not appear to have been an impor-\\ntant factor. I would have recommended a transesoph-\\nageal echocardiographic study as the next diagnostic\\nprocedure, to reassess the mitral-valve apparatus as a\\nprelude to surgery for correction of the mitral regur-\\ngitation. In the absence of additional information\\npointing to a process other than necrosis and dys-\\nfunction of the anterolateral papillary muscle, valve\\nreplacement rather than repair would have been nec-\\nessary.38 Histologic analysis and culture of the spec-\\nimens submitted at the time of surgery would have\\nprovided further insight.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nProlapse of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve,\\nwith noncontractility of the papillary muscle.\\nDR. PATRICK T. O'GARA'S DIAGNOSIS\\nNecrosis of the anterolateral papillary muscle,\\nwith severe mitral regurgitation.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. NAVNEET NARULA: The patient underwent a\\nmitral-valve replacement. The specimen consisted of\\nfragments of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve\\nwith attached chordae tendineae and a small fragment\\nof the head of the anterolateral papillary muscle.\\nThere was no evidence of endocarditis. The head of\\nthe papillary muscle was mummified, with necrotic,\\nhypereosinophilic myocytes lacking nuclei (Fig. 4);\\nthere was no evidence of repair. We did not find any\\nemboli.\\nPapillary muscle can form a finger-like projection\\nor can be tethered to the ventricular wall. 39,40 Finger-\\nlike papillary muscle derives its blood supply from a\\ncentral artery, which has no collateral connections\\nwith the subendocardial plexus of vessels. Tethered\\npapillary muscle receives its blood supply segmentally\\nand has extensive collateral circulation with the sub-\\nendocardial plexus.41 In transesophageal echocardio-\\ngraphic studies of 20 patients undergoing coronary-\\nartery bypass surgery,42 the posteromedial papillary\\nmuscles were supplied by a single artery in 67 per-\\ncent of the patients, and the anterolateral papillary\\nmuscles received a dual vascular supply in 71 per-\\ncent. Mitral regurgitation did not occur in any of the\\npatients who had previously had an inferior myocar-\\ndial infarction and who had a dual vascular supply to\\neither papillary muscle, whereas it occurred in 60\\npercent of the patients with a single-vessel supply.\\nThese data indicate that infarction of posteromedial\\npapillary muscle is more common than infarction of\\nanterolateral papillary muscle.\\nDR. JOREN C. MADSEN: After the mitral-valve\\nreplacement, the patient had an excellent recovery\\nand was discharged. Six weeks later, however, he was\\nreadmitted with septic shock. Blood cultures were\\npositive for S. aureus, and there was a large vegeta-\\ntion on the aortic-valve prosthesis.

      "Answer: \n",
      "Based on the patient's history, clinical presentation, and diagnostic findings, the most likely diagnosis is **prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Information Gathering:**\n",
      "    *   **Key Signs/Symptoms:** Dyspnea, increasing mitral regurgitation, fever, chest pain, cough, chills, dyspnea, and increasing mitral regurgitation.\n",
      "    *   **Duration:** The initial episode of endocarditis was 4 months prior, and the current episode developed 5 weeks after discharge.\n",
      "    *   **Epidemiologic Context:** History of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) is a significant risk factor for endocarditis, particularly involving the tricuspid valve.\n",
      "    *   **Relevant Comorbidities/Medications:** History of aortic valve replacement, warfarin therapy, and recent antibiotic treatment for bacterial endocarditis.\n",
      "    *   **Red-Flag Features:** The presence of a large vegetation on the aortic valve, the development of new vegetations on the prosthetic valve, and the patient's clinical deterioration despite antibiotic treatment are all concerning for PVE.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\n",
      "    *   **Anatomical System:** The primary concern is the prosthetic valve, given the history of aortic valve replacement.\n",
      "    *   **Timing/Progression:** The initial episode of endocarditis was likely related to the IVDA, and the current episode is a recurrence of PVE.\n",
      "    *   **Broad Differential:** PVE, other forms of endocarditis (native valve), septic emboli, and other causes of heart failure.\n",
      "    *   **Illness Scripts:** Prosthetic valve endocarditis, septic emboli, acute heart failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
      "    *   **Defining vs. Discriminatory Features:** The presence of a large vegetation on the prosthetic valve, the development of new vegetations, and the patient's clinical deterioration are highly suggestive of PVE. The negative blood cultures for the initial episode of endocarditis, while not definitive, make native valve endocarditis less likely.\n",
      "    *   **Point-of-Care Tests/Labs:** Blood cultures (repeat), echocardiogram (repeat), transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to visualize vegetations and assess valve function, and cardiac biomarkers (troponin) to rule out myocardial infarction.\n",
      "    *   **Potential Diagnostic Biases:** Anchoring bias (the initial diagnosis of endocarditis may influence subsequent interpretations), availability bias (the presence of a prosthetic valve may lead to a focus on PVE), and framing bias (the presentation of the patient's symptoms may influence the diagnosis).\n",
      "    *   **Early Empiric Considerations:** Given the high suspicion for PVE, empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly, covering common pathogens such as *Staphylococcus aureus*, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and gram-negative bacilli.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:**\n",
      "    *   The patient's history of IVDA, aortic valve replacement, and the presence of a large vegetation on the prosthetic valve strongly suggest PVE. The clinical deterioration despite antibiotic treatment further supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "    *   The negative blood cultures for the initial episode of endocarditis make native valve endocarditis less likely, but it cannot be completely ruled out.\n",
      "    *   The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with heart failure secondary to mitral regurgitation caused by the PVE.\n",
      "    *   The presence of multiple vegetations on the prosthetic valve suggests a high risk of further complications, such as valve dysfunction, abscess formation, and embolic events.\n",

PATRICK T. O'GARA*: Dr. Weyman, may we\\nreview the echocardiographic studies?\\nDR. ARTHUR E. WEYMAN: The first transesopha-\\ngeal echocardiogram (Fig. 1) shows a large echogenic\\nmass attached to the aortic valve, predominantly in-\\nvolving the right coronary cusp but lying very close\\nto the orifice of the left coronary artery as the valve\\nopens. There is also a separation between the layers\\nof the wall of the aortic root, a finding consistent\\nwith the presence of a small abscess. An echogenic\\nmass on the base of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid\\nvalve is consistent with the spread of infection to the\\nright side of the heart.\\nThe second transesophageal echocardiogram (Fig.\\n2), obtained after replacement of the aortic valve,\\nshows normal opening and closing of the prosthetic\\nvalve; the tricuspid valve is free of vegetation. There\\nis severe prolapse of the anterior leaflet of the mitral\\nvalve, with malcoaptation and moderate-to-severe\\ninsufficiency of flow. The anterolateral papillary mus-\\ncle appears much longer than on the previous exam-\\nination, reaching almost to the tip of the mitral-valve\\nleaflet. It does not contract, and its head is connected\\nto the myocardium by a long, thin stalk. At the base\\nof the papillary muscle the contraction of the myo-\\ncardium is normal.\\nDR. O'GARA: Infective endocarditis occurs in 2 to\\n5 percent of intravenous drug abusers each year, a fre-\\nquency far exceeding that in patients with rheumatic\\nheart disease or prosthetic valves. 1,2 Most of the\\nreported cases are in men, and the age at presentation\\nis usually in the third or fourth decade.3 S. aureus is\\nthe causative organism in more than half the cases and\\nin more than 70 percent of cases involving the tricus-\\npid valve.4 Not more than 20 to 25 percent of patients\\nhave preexisting valvular or congenital heart dis-\\nease.4,5 The mechanism by which certain virulent or-\\nganisms, such as S. aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae,\\ninfect structurally normal valves without apparent\\nantecedent endothelial damage remains unknown.\\nRepeated injections of foreign material may trauma-\\ntize the tricuspid valve, or immunologic phenomena\\nmay cause nonspecific valvulitis.4,6 The clinical man-\\nifestations of infective endocarditis in intravenous\\ndrug abusers depend on the valve (or valves) infected\\nand, to a lesser extent, on the causative organism.\\nThe manifestations are similar to those observed in\\npersons with native-valve infective endocarditis who\\nare not abusing drugs.\\nEvidence of septic pulmonary emboli can be\\nfound in as many as 75 percent of patients with in-\\nvolvement of the tricuspid valve, and systemic emboli\\nare apparent in as many as 40 percent of patients\\nwith involvement of left-sided valves.4,5,7 Cerebral,\\ncoronary, and mesenteric arterial emboli may never-\\ntheless elude clinical detection. Embolism may be\\nmore frequent when S. aureus is the infectious\\nagent. Relapse of an initial infection with S. aureus\\nusually suggests that primary therapy was inadequate,\\nbut intravenous drug abuse is the most common risk\\nfactor for recurrence.9\\nMany of the symptoms reported by this patient\\nbefore his current hospital admission raise the pos-\\nsibility that he had an infection of the tricuspid\\nvalve with septic pulmonary emboli or transient\\nbacteremia, either of which can be related to intra-\\nvenous drug abuse. This possibility was not verified,\\nhowever, by subsequent clinical, radiographic, and\\nlaboratory data. The patient's clinical improvement\\nafter treatment for pulmonary edema suggests that\\nthe edema may have caused most or all of his symp-\\ntoms at that point. A more detailed description of\\nthe chest pain would have been useful in the light\\nof later concern about the integrity of the mitral-\\nvalve apparatus. Chest pain may have been a marker\\nfor either papillary-muscle infarction or chordal\\nrupture.\\nClinicians caring for patients in whom heart fail-\\nure develops after valve replacement must remain\\nvigilant for signs of prosthetic-valve dysfunction.\\nPrimary structural degeneration of the Carpentier-\\nEdwards pericardial-valve prosthesis within the time\\nframe reported in this case would have been very\\nunlikely. More pertinent areas of concern, alone or\\nin combination, would have been destruction of the\\nleaflet of the prosthesis, paravalvular regurgitation,\\nor dehiscence of the sewing ring due to residual or\\nrecurrent infection, inadequate tissue integrity at the\\ntime of the initial operation, or an improper suturing\\ntechnique. The risk of prosthetic-valve endocarditis\\nis highest within the first six months after surgery,\\nparticularly the first six weeks; the risk is increased\\nin patients with a history of native-valve endocar-\\nditis. 10,11 Prosthetic-valve endocarditis of early onset,\\ndefined as developing within 60 days after surgery,\\nusually results from nosocomial infection, whereas\\nendocarditis of later onset is more commonly due to\\nVolume 339 Number 7 461\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Coagulase-negative\\nstaphylococci, most of which are S. epidermidis, are\\nthe most common causes of early-onset prosthetic-\\nvalve endocarditis, although S. aureus, diphtheroids,\\ngram-negative bacilli, and fungi have also been im-\\nplicated. There is a high frequency of methicillin\\nresistance among strains of coagulase-negative staph-\\nylococci, commensurate with their nosocomial ori-\\ngin. Involvement of the prosthetic aortic valve and\\ninfection within the first postoperative year impart\\nan increased risk of local tissue invasion. Dysfunc-\\ntion of the prosthetic valve was not observed in this\\npatient.\\nSeveral well-described subaortic complications of\\naortic-valve infective endocarditis, seen particularly\\nwith infection by S. aureus, were not observed in\\nthis patient.5,12-14 These include extension of the in-\\nfection from the left or noncoronary aortic-valve\\ncusp into the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa,\\nresulting in abscess formation, aneurysm, or fistu-\\nlous perforation into the left atrium or pericardial\\nspace; transport of infective vegetative material along\\nthe aortic regurgitant stream onto the subjacent an-\\nterior leaflet of the mitral valve, with formation of\\nan aneurysm or fistulous perforation; similar delivery\\nof septic material onto the chordae tendineae, with\\nerosion and rupture; extension of the infection from\\nthe right or noncoronary cusp beyond the annulus,\\nwith involvement of the conduction system, produc-\\ning varying degrees of atrioventricular or left bundle-\\nbranch block; extension from the right coronary\\ncusp to the region of the membranous interventric-\\nular septum, with rupture into the right ventricle;\\nand periannular burrowing, with the creation of aor-\\ntocameral fistulas, usually involving the right atrium\\nor right ventricle. Transesophageal echocardiographic\\ndemonstration of one or more of the first three\\ncomplications would have provided a plausible ex-\\nplanation for the mitral regurgitation observed in this\\npatient. A well-performed transesophageal echocar-\\ndiographic study should have detected either in-\\nvolvement of the intervalvular fibrosa or an acquired\\nlesion of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet. However,\\nthis technique can overlook limited chordal rupture\\nor erosion, which in some cases is confirmed only at\\nsurgery or autopsy.\\nMitral regurgitation can result from anatomical or\\nfunctional impairment of the mitral-valve apparatus\\nat one or more of its four major components: the\\nleaflets, the annulus, the chordae tendineae, and the\\npapillary muscles and contiguous left ventricular\\nmyocardium. The mechanism of the mitral-valve\\nregurgitation in this patient is clearly defined by the\\nserial echocardiographic studies. They demonstrate\\nprolapse (abnormal superior and posterior systolic\\ndisplacement beyond the annular plane) of at least\\nthe lateral half of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet,\\nleading to malcoaptation of the leaflet and regurgi-\\ntation. Mitral-valve prolapse is most commonly asso-\\nciated with myxomatous changes within the spongiosa\\nof the valve, resulting in thickening and redundancy,\\nalong with elongation of the chordae and dilatation\\nof the annulus. Such valvular changes were not ob-\\nserved in this patient.\\nThe later echocardiographic studies suggest mild,\\ndiffuse thickening of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet,\\nwhich may reflect a nonspecific postinflammatory\\nchange in the architecture of the leaflet.15 Mitral-\\nvalve prolapse has been described in patients with\\nenlargement of structures of the right side of the\\nheart. In Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve or\\nin an atrial septal ostium secundum defect, for exam-\\nple, the left ventricular chamber becomes distorted\\nand smaller, resulting in an excess of mitral-valve\\ntissue relative to the reduced ventricular volume.16\\nHowever, the right ventricular enlargement that de-\\nveloped in this patient was only slight and probably\\ndid not cause the observed prolapse. Mitral-valve\\nprolapse may also coexist with rheumatic mitral-\\nvalve disease and with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\\nas a result of abnormal positioning of the papillary\\nmuscles, but neither of these disorders is pertinent\\nto this case.17 Mitral-valve prolapse has developed in\\nsome patients after myocardial infarction, possibly in\\nrelation to papillary-muscle dysfunction.18\\nThe transesophageal echocardiographic study per-\\nformed during this patient's second hospitalization\\ndemonstrated elongation of the papillary muscle with\\nexaggerated systolic excursion toward the mitral-valve\\nannulus during systole and a reduction in the nor-\\nmal distance between the head of the anterolateral\\npapillary muscle and the plane of the annulus.18 The\\nelongation might suggest abnormal stretching of the\\nmuscle, as if it were extending superiorly rather than\\ncontracting apically, or thinning of the muscle due\\nto necrosis and tissue loss. At issue is whether such\\nabnormal movement, which has been clearly delin-\\neated in patients with typical mitral-valve prolapse in\\nthe setting of myxomatous thickening, is due pri-\\nmarily to chordae-leaflet derangement, papillary-\\nmuscle dysfunction, or both.18 Chordal rupture with\\npartial leaflet flail would be expected to cause ever-\\nsion of the affected portion of the leaflet into the left\\natrium.19 In the current case, the echocardiographic\\nimages suggest instead that the lateral half of the an-\\nterior leaflet rises above and somewhat parallel to\\nthe annular plane, without such marked angulation\\ntoward the left atrium. Loss of chordal attachment\\nwould not allow the superior traction on the papil-\\nlary muscle that is seen with typical leaflet prolapse.\\nOur attention must shift, then, to the papillary mus-\\ncle and to processes than can interfere with its con-\\ntribution to the integrity of the mitral apparatus.\\nContractile dysfunction of the papillary muscle\\ncan result from ischemia, infarction, infection (with\\nabscess), infiltration (amyloidosis or sarcoidosis), or\\n462\\nAugust 13, 1998\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Edwards37\\nhad previously reported a case of fatal rupture of the\\nanterolateral papillary muscle due to coronary em-\\nbolism in a patient who had aortic-valve infective\\nendocarditis without apparent involvement of the\\nmitral leaflet or chordae.\\nThe nature and temporal evolution of this patient's\\nmitral regurgitation suggest that the inciting event\\nwas a subclinical insult to the anterolateral papillary\\nmuscle, possibly due to small-vessel embolism from\\nthe infective endocarditis of the aortic valve. The he-\\nmodynamic changes may have caused further injury,\\nand the severe aortic regurgitation may have reduced\\nperfusion pressure. Cardiac surgery would impose\\nthe additional stress of ischemia and reperfusion.\\nTissue necrosis and impairment of wound healing\\nwould explain the observed elongation, dysfunction,\\nand abnormal movement of the papillary muscle,\\nwhich eventually resulted in prolapse of the leaflet\\nand progressively more severe regurgitation. Chordal\\nrupture or erosion may have contributed to this\\nprocess but does not appear to have been an impor-\\ntant factor. I would have recommended a transesoph-\\nageal echocardiographic study as the next diagnostic\\nprocedure, to reassess the mitral-valve apparatus as a\\nprelude to surgery for correction of the mitral regur-\\ngitation. In the absence of additional information\\npointing to a process other than necrosis and dys-\\nfunction of the anterolateral papillary muscle, valve\\nreplacement rather than repair would have been nec-\\nessary.38 Histologic analysis and culture of the spec-\\nimens submitted at the time of surgery would have\\nprovided further insight.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nProlapse of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve,\\nwith noncontractility of the papillary muscle.\\nDR. PATRICK T. O'GARA'S DIAGNOSIS\\nNecrosis of the anterolateral papillary muscle,\\nwith severe mitral regurgitation.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. NAVNEET NARULA: The patient underwent a\\nmitral-valve replacement. The specimen consisted of\\nfragments of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve\\nwith attached chordae tendineae and a small fragment\\nof the head of the anterolateral papillary muscle.\\nThere was no evidence of endocarditis. The head of\\nthe papillary muscle was mummified, with necrotic,\\nhypereosinophilic myocytes lacking nuclei (Fig. 4);\\nthere was no evidence of repair. We did not find any\\nemboli.\\nPapillary muscle can form a finger-like projection\\nor can be tethered to the ventricular wall. 39,40 Finger-\\nlike papillary muscle derives its blood supply from a\\ncentral artery, which has no collateral connections\\nwith the subendocardial plexus of vessels. Tethered\\npapillary muscle receives its blood supply segmentally\\nand has extensive collateral circulation with the sub-\\nendocardial plexus.41 In transesophageal echocardio-\\ngraphic studies of 20 patients undergoing coronary-\\nartery bypass surgery,42 the posteromedial papillary\\nmuscles were supplied by a single artery in 67 per-\\ncent of the patients, and the anterolateral papillary\\nmuscles received a dual vascular supply in 71 per-\\ncent. Mitral regurgitation did not occur in any of the\\npatients who had previously had an inferior myocar-\\ndial infarction and who had a dual vascular supply to\\neither papillary muscle, whereas it occurred in 60\\npercent of the patients with a single-vessel supply.\\nThese data indicate that infarction of posteromedial\\npapillary muscle is more common than infarction of\\nanterolateral papillary muscle.\\nDR. JOREN C. MADSEN: After the mitral-valve\\nreplacement, the patient had an excellent recovery\\nand was discharged. Six weeks later, however, he was\\nreadmitted with septic shock. Blood cultures were\\npositive for S. aureus, and there was a large vegeta-\\ntion on the aortic-valve prosthesis. After vigorous\\ntreatment, the patient recovered, but two weeks later\\nnew vegetations appeared on the prosthesis. Since he\\nFigure 4.

Microscopical examination revealed a\\nhealed myocardial infarct and a few small foci of my-\\nocyte loss and fibrosis. The coronary arteries were\\nwidely patent. We did not find a lesion that account-\\ned for the papillary-muscle necrosis. There was no\\nevidence of recent or earlier embolic material in the\\nintramyocardial arteries. We cannot rule out the\\npossibility that an earlier embolus lysed or became\\nobliterated at the base of the papillary muscle.\\n\", 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"Based on the patient's history, clinical presentation, and diagnostic findings, the most likely diagnosis is **prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE)**.\\n\\nHere's the reasoning:\\n\\n1.  **Information Gathering:**\\n    *   **Key Signs/Symptoms:** Dyspnea, increasing mitral regurgitation, fever, chest pain, cough, chills, dyspnea, and increasing mitral regurgitation.\\n    *   **Duration:** The initial episode of endocarditis was 4 months prior, and the current episode developed 5 weeks after discharge.\\n    *   **Epidemiologic Context:** History of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) is a significant risk factor for endocarditis, particularly involving the tricuspid valve.\\n    *   **Relevant Comorbidities/Medications:** History of aortic valve replacement, warfarin therapy, and recent antibiotic treatment for bacterial endocarditis.\\n    *   **Red-Flag Features:** The presence of a large vegetation on the aortic valve, the development of new vegetations on the prosthetic valve, and the patient's clinical deterioration despite antibiotic treatment are all concerning for PVE.\\n\\n2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\\n    *   **Anatomical System:** The primary concern is the prosthetic valve, given the history of aortic valve replacement.\\n    *   **Timing/Progression:** The initial episode of endocarditis was likely related to the IVDA, and the current episode is a recurrence of PVE.\\n    *   **Broad Differential:** PVE, other forms of endocarditis (native valve), septic emboli, and other causes of heart failure.\\n    *   **Illness Scripts:** Prosthetic valve endocarditis, septic emboli, acute heart failure.\\n\\n3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\\n    *   **Defining vs. Discriminatory Features:** The presence of a large vegetation on the prosthetic valve, the development of new vegetations, and the patient's clinical deterioration are highly suggestive of PVE.

Chest radiographs\\n(Fig. 1) showed densely opacified right lower and\\nmiddle lobes, which were sharply marginated, asso-\\nciated with volume loss and areas of bronchiectasis.\\nThere was an area of poorly defined opacification\\nin the left lower lobe. An antibiotic was prescribed,\\nbut repeated radiographs remained abnormal. Two\\nmonths before admission, a computed tomographic\\n(CT) scan of the chest (Fig. 2) revealed atelectasis\\nand bronchiectasis of the right middle and lower\\nlobes and scattered areas of air-space disease in the\\nleft upper lobe. A noncalcified endobronchial lesion\\nwas noted in the bronchus intermedius of the right\\nlung, at the upper margin of the bronchiectatic seg-\\nment. Examination of stool specimens showed cysts\\nof Entamoeba coli and ova of Ascaris lumbricoides.\\nThe patient was referred to this hospital.\\nThe boy was a native of El Salvador. His health had\\nbeen good until two years before admission, when he\\nwas admitted to another hospital because of pneu-\\nmonia with night sweats and spikes of fever (tempera-\\nture of up to 40°C). A tuberculin skin test was strong-\\nly positive, and he was treated with a triple-antibiotic\\nregimen for tuberculosis, although no tubercle bacilli\\nwere detected in his sputum and there was no known\\nsource of exposure. He was discharged after six\\nmonths and continued to receive treatment for a\\nyear. His family had immigrated to this country nine\\nmonths before his admission. There was no history of\\nrecurrent respiratory tract infections or of aspiration,\\nand the family history was unremarkable.\\nThe temperature was 37.4°C, the pulse was 98,\\nand the respirations were 24. The blood pressure\\nwas 90/60 mm Hg.\\nThe results of a physical examination were normal\\nexcept for dullness and bronchial breathing over the\\nright lung base and right axilla.\\nThe levels of urea nitrogen, creatinine, bilirubin,\\nalbumin, electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, lac-\\ntate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase were\\nnormal. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplas-\\ntin times were normal. The results of other hemato-\\nlogic laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Chest ra-\\ndiographs showed a right perihilar opacity, a finding\\nconsistent with the presence of pneumonia. Areas of\\nserpiginous radiolucency in the medial portion of\\nthe right lung base were consistent with the pres-\\nence of bronchiectasis. The mediastinum, heart, and\\nbone appeared normal.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. ROBERT H. CLEVELAND*: The case history\\nindicates previous exposure to three organisms that\\nare endemic in El Salvador (the tubercle bacillus,\\nEnt. coli, and A. lumbricoides) and that may be relat-\\ned to this boy\\'s current illness.\\nThe diagnosis, I believe, lies in a few subtle find-\\nings on the chest films and CT scan. The films ob-\\ntained three months before admission (Fig. 1) show\\nsharply bordered, dense opacifications of the right\\nlower and middle lobes, a finding associated with\\nvolume loss, which indicates the presence of atelecta-\\nsis. Bronchiectasis is present within the involved ar-\\neas of the right lung. A poorly defined opacification\\nis present in the left lower lobe, a finding consistent\\nwith the presence of an area of remote air-space dis-\\nease, possibly due to pneumonia. The CT scan ob-\\ntained two months before admission (Fig. 2) con-\\nfirms the presence of atelectasis and bronchiectasis in\\nthe right middle and lower lobes and also shows fo-\\ncal alveolar opacifications within the lateral and lin-\\ngular segments of the left upper lobe. Particularly\\nnotable is a noncalcified endobronchial lesion in the\\nbronchus intermedius of the right lung, at the prox-\\nimal margin of the bronchiectatic segments (Fig. 2,\\nlower panel). An endobronchial lesion may be present\\nwithin the bronchus of the right middle lobe. There\\nis no evidence of calcified tissue, lymphadenopathy,\\na mass (except for the endobronchial lesion), or ab-\\nnormal vessels.\\nThe main finding, bronchiectasis, warrants the con-\\nsideration of anatomical, infectious, and other causes.\\nPossible anatomical disorders include a mass com-\\npressing a bronchus and causing chronic obstruction,\\nan endobronchial tumor, an anatomical abnormality\\nof the bronchus, the dysmotile cilia syndrome, Kartag-\\nener\\'s syndrome (dysmotile cilia with situs inversus),\\npulmonary sequestration, the Williams-Campbell\\nsyndrome (deficient bronchial cartilage), tracheomeg-\\naly, the Mounier-Kuhn syndrome (tracheobroncho-\\nmegaly), severe pectus excavatum, and scoliosis. Pos-\\nsible infectious disorders include previous measles,\\npertussis, or other viral infections; chronic pyogenic\\ninfection; tuberculosis or histoplasmosis; bronchio-\\nlitis obliterans; and allergic bronchopulmonary asper-\\ngillosis. In the third category are cystic fibrosis, asth-\\nma, genetic defects (including Marfan\\'s syndrome),\\nimmunodeficiency, heroin addiction, Young\\'s syn-\\ndrome (sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and azoospermia),\\naspiration of a foreign body, gastroesophageal reflux\\nwith aspiration, other causes of aspiration,1-4 lung\\ntransplantation,5,6 inhalation of toxic gases, familial or\\ncongenital disorders,8,9 and alpha-antitrypsin defi-\\nciency.10\\nSeveral diagnostic possibilities can be immediately\\nruled out, including previous viral infections, heroin\\naddiction, Young\\'s syndrome, genetic defects, lung\\ntransplantation, inhalation of toxic gases, and famil-\\nial or congenital disorders. Since the tracheobron-\\nchial system was normal except for bronchiectasis\\nand atelectasis of the right lung base, we can also\\nrule out anatomical abnormalities, Kartagener\\'s syn-\\ndrome (this boy\\'s heart is on the left side), trache-\\nomegaly, and the Mounier-Kuhn syndrome. Since\\nbronchiectasis was limited to the right lung base,\\ncystic fibrosis, the dysmotile cilia syndrome (with si-\\ntus solitus), and the Williams-Campbell syndrome\\nare unlikely. An immunodeficiency is improbable be-\\ncause the boy did not have multisystem infections\\nand was in generally good health, and allergic bron-\\nchopulmonary aspergillosis is unlikely because there\\nwas no history of reactive airway disease (asthma) or\\nevidence of cystic fibrosis. The absence of evidence\\nof emphysema or liver disease rules out alpha₁-anti-\\ntrypsin deficiency. Chronic unremitting bacterial\\npneumonia and gastroesophageal reflux with recur-\\nrent aspiration are not suggested by the history.\\nThere was also no history of exposure to mineral oil.\\nNo mass compressing a bronchus was seen on the\\nCT scan or the chest films. Bronchiolitis obliterans\\nis characterized by areas of relative hyperinflation\\nand decreased vascularity, which are often asymmet-\\nric findings that were absent in this case.11 There\\nwas no physical or radiographic evidence of scoliosis\\nor pectus excavatum, and the boy did not have the\\ncharacteristic body habitus of Marfan\\'s syndrome.\\nThe remaining possibilities are pulmonary seques-\\ntration, an endobronchial tumor, fibrogranuloma-\\ntous disease (tuberculosis or histoplasmosis), and as-\\npiration of a foreign body. Before discussing those\\ndiagnoses, I shall comment briefly on the two doc-\\numented parasitic infestations.\\nPneumonia associated with ascariasis is an acute\\ndisorder characterized by peripheral eosinophilia and\\nrapidly changing parenchymal opacifications a type\\nof Löffler\\'s syndrome.12 Since the boy had an eosin-\\nophil count of 1 percent and atypical pulmonary ra-\\ndiographic findings, ascariasis should be considered\\nas a possible, although unlikely, diagnosis. It has not\\nbeen associated with bronchiectasis.\\nAmebic infestation, however, has been accompa-\\nnied by bronchiectasis in rare cases. 13,14 The most\\ncommon route of pulmonary involvement is direct\\nextension from a hepatic amebic abscess, accounting\\nfor the high frequency of right-lower-lobe involve-\\nment. This boy\\'s liver was normal on CT scanning.\\nPulmonary involvement in the absence of a liver ab-\\nscess occurs infrequently, presumably as a result of\\nsystemic spread.13,14 The normal erythrocyte sedi-\\nmentation rate also makes amebic infestation unlike-\\nly in this case.\\nPulmonary sequestration is a spectrum of disor-\\nders characterized by a mass of abnormal pulmonary\\ntissue that does not communicate with the tracheo-\\nbronchial tree through a normally located bronchus\\nand is supplied by an abnormal feeding artery.15 Se-\\nquestration is classified as either extralobar or intra-\\nlobar. The extralobar type has its own pleural invest-\\nment, a feeding artery that is usually systemic but\\nmay be pulmonary, and a vein that drains into the\\nsystemic venous system, usually into the azygos or\\nhemiazygos vein. Eighty to 90 percent of extralobar\\nsequestrations are left-sided; they are more common\\nin males than in females and may communicate with\\nthe esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Other com-\\nmonly associated anomalies include diaphragmatic\\nhernia and eventration. Extralobar sequestrations\\nmay be found below the diaphragm and are usually\\ndiscovered incidentally, appearing as a persistent\\nbasilar opacification on chest films or on prenatal or\\nneonatal ultrasonographic examination.15,16\\nIn the past, an intralobar sequestration was con-\\nsidered a congenital lesion, with a feeding artery\\narising from the aorta or a major branch and a vein\\ndraining into the pulmonary venous system, with no\\nseparate pleural investment. Sixty percent of intralo-\\nbar sequestrations are left-sided, and most are within\\nthe posterior basilar segments of the lower lobes.\\nMales and females are affected in equal numbers. A\\nforegut communication and other associated anom-\\nalies are very rare. Intralobar sequestrations usually\\npresent with recurrent infection and are occasionally\\naccompanied by postinfectious bronchiectasis in old-\\ner children or adults. 15,16 The current opinion is that\\nthese sequestrations are not congenital and may in-\\nstead result from recurrent infection. The presence\\nof a normal connection with the tracheobronchial\\nsystem in many cases supports this view. Although\\nintralobar sequestration with postinfectious bron-\\nchiectasis is a possible diagnosis in this case, the ab-\\nsence of a recognizable feeding artery or draining\\nvein on the CT scan is evidence against it. Also, the\\ninvolvement of two lobes is uncharacteristic of the\\ndisorder.\\nThe presence of an endobronchial mass on the\\nCT scan suggests the diagnosis of an endobronchial\\ntumor, which is rare in children. Carcinoids and mu-\\ncoepidermoid carcinomas are the most common\\ntypes.17,18 Other reported types include inflammato-\\nry pseudotumor (plasma-cell granuloma),18 leiomy-\\noma,19 fibrosarcoma,18 rhabdomyosarcoma,18 hamar-\\ntoma, 20 fibrous histiocytoma,21 and schwannoma.22\\nIn advanced cases of juvenile laryngeal papillomato-\\nsis, there are multiple polypoid masses within the\\ntracheobronchial tree, and nodules, which can cavi-\\ntate, may be found within the lung parenchyma.\\nThere is one case report of an endobronchial polyp\\nassociated with a foreign body.23 Since the CT find-\\nings in this case suggest the possible presence of\\nmore than one endobronchial lesion and since bron-\\nchial tumors are rare in children, a neoplastic cause\\nis unlikely. The absence of diffuse tracheobronchial\\nand pulmonary parenchymal lesions rules out the di-\\nagnosis of papillomatosis.\\nAmong granulomatous infections, tuberculosis is\\nthe most likely, since the boy had had a positive tu-\\nberculin skin test. If there had been abnormal find-\\nings on a chest film obtained during his illness in El\\nSalvador, I assume they would have been reported in\\nthe medical record there. In primary tuberculosis,\\nperibronchial lymph nodes may become infected,\\nenlarge, and compress a bronchus, which leads to\\nobstruction and eventual bronchiectasis, or an in-\\nfected lymph node may erode directly into a bron-\\nchus and cause obstruction as an endobronchial for-\\neign body. When the intrabronchial node is calcified,\\nit is called a broncholith. With chronic obstruction,\\nbronchiectasis, or both, low-grade bacterial superin-\\nfection may lead to bronchogenic spread of infection\\nto other segments of the lung. The cause of the\\noriginal infection of the peribronchial lymph nodes\\nmay be unrelated to the organism responsible for the\\nlater pulmonary infection.1\\nIn children, only 17 percent of primary parenchy-\\nmal tuberculous lesions eventually calcify, as com-\\npared with 36 percent of infected lymph nodes.24 In\\nadolescents, calcification occurs over a period of five\\nyears or more; in younger children, it develops after\\na shorter period.25 Calcium may disappear in up to\\na third of previously calcified lesions.26 Therefore,\\nthe absence of calcium in the lung parenchyma, the\\nhilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and the endo-\\nbronchial lesion does not rule out the diagnosis of\\ntuberculosis. However, in cases of histoplasmosis,\\nmost, if not all, endobronchial masses that are com-\\nposed of peribronchial nodal tissue are calcified.27\\nThus, histoplasmosis is a less likely diagnosis than\\ntuberculosis.\\nIn children, endobronchial tuberculosis is usually\\na complication of primary tuberculosis.28 Although\\nwith modern medical management, most patients are\\ncured, late sequelae, including bronchiectasis, bron-\\nchial stricture, airless fibrotic segments, and bron-\\ncholiths, 1,29 have been reported in up to 68 percent\\nof patients. 29 In one series, bronchiectasis accounted\\nfor 39 percent of the late sequelae,29 and in another\\nseries, endobronchial masses accounted for 62 per-\\ncent of late complications. 28\\nYoung children often refuse to take medication,\\nespecially when they feel well. Had this boy been\\ntreated only at home, my leading diagnosis might\\nhave been tuberculosis. Since he was treated in the\\nhospital for six months, I must assume that he re-\\nceived adequate treatment. Also, there was a two-\\nyear hiatus between the treatment for tuberculosis\\nand the current three-month illness characterized by\\na cough and low-grade fever.\\nAlthough the case record does not include a his-\\ntory of aspiration, aspiration of one or more foreign\\nbodies is my leading diagnosis. In 16 to 46 percent\\nof cases in some series, aspiration of foreign bodies\\nin children was not recognized initially, 30-33 and no\\nhistory of aspiration was recorded in 14 to 25 percent\\nof cases. 30,31,34 Delayed diagnosis of an endobronchi-\\nal foreign body may result in bronchiectasis, atelec-\\ntasis, abscess formation, chronic pneumonia, bronchi-\\nal stenosis, empyema, and fistula formation.33,35,36 In\\na child with chronic cough and atelectasis, bronchial\\nobstruction from a foreign body should always be\\nconsidered as a possible diagnosis.33 Wheezing37,38\\nand hemoptysis33,35,36 are frequent symptoms.\\nUp to two thirds of cases of aspiration of foreign\\nbodies30,32,37,39 occur in boys, and peanuts account\\nfor approximately a third of the aspirated items.32,34,37,38\\nIn young children, aspiration involves the right and\\nleft lungs with approximately equal frequency, but\\nin older children, the right lung is more commonly\\ninvolved. 37,38,40 Multiple foreign bodies have been\\nrecovered in up to 5 percent of cases.39 About two\\nthirds of foreign bodies are lodged in the main\\nbronchi, and the remaining third are lodged distal-\\nly.38 Distal foreign bodies are more difficult to di-\\nagnose.31\\nAn endobronchial lesion is present in the bron-\\nchus intermedius in this patient, and there may be\\nanother lesion near the origin of the right-middle-\\nlobe bronchus. The density of the mass on the CT\\nscan is that of soft tissue and is therefore not specific.\\nA peanut or a grass inflorescence could have this ap-\\npearance. Although I do not recommend magnetic\\nresonance imaging to determine the nature of endo-\\nbronchial foreign bodies, it can detect the oil in a\\npeanut and might therefore allow a specific diagnosis.\\nMy final diagnosis is aspiration of one or more\\nforeign bodies, with postobstructive bronchiectasis\\nand a spillover of infection to other lung segments.\\nThe diagnostic procedure was probably a broncho-\\nscopic examination followed by resection of the af-\\nfected right lower and middle lobes.\\nDR. KON-TAIK KHAW: Does the finding of a\\nwell-defined area of atelectasis and bronchiectasis on\\nthe CT scan help reject or confirm the diagnosis of\\naspiration of a foreign body?\\nDR. CLEVELAND: The bronchiectasis, which was\\nfairly severe in this case, could be classified as cystic\\nbronchiectasis, suggesting that it was at least moder-\\nately chronic. Experimental studies have shown that\\nreversible, mild bronchial dilatation may develop if a\\nbronchus is transiently obstructed. However, with\\nongoing obstruction, particularly in association with\\nsuperimposed infection, the development of severe\\nbronchiectasis is much more likely. The severity of\\nthe bronchiectasis does not necessarily indicate the\\ncause of the obstruction, but peanuts and other veg-\\netable matter may exude toxins or swell as water in-\\nfiltrates the foreign body, and these effects, in turn,\\nmay be associated with severe bronchiectasis.\\nDR. JOHN BRADFORD: How do you explain the\\nchanges in the left lingula?\\nDR. CLEVELAND: A low-grade pyogenic superin-\\nfection of the bronchiectatic lung probably spread to\\nother segments, resulting in foci of pneumonia.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Dr. Casavant, as the pri-\\nmary physician, would you give us your impressions\\nas you cared for this boy?\\nDR. DAVID W. CASAVANT: He was referred to me\\nby the local public health office. Except for de-\\ncreased breath sounds at the right base, I did not\\nfind any abnormalities on examination. What con-\\ncerned me most was his history of tuberculosis. The\\nboy told me that his mother was not in El Salvador\\nwhen he was treated, and we did not have any of the\\nrecords from El Salvador at that time. Other diag-\\nnoses I considered were a vascular malformation,\\npulmonary sequestration, and a parasitic infection.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\n? Pulmonary sequestration.\\nDR. ROBERT H. CLEVELAND\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nAspiration of a foreign body, with postobstructive\\nbronchiectasis and infection of other lung seg-\\nments.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. MARK: Dr. Kinane, will you tell us your im-\\npressions at the time of admission and during the di-\\nagnostic procedure?\\nDR. T. BERNARD KINANE: We thought it was un-\\nlikely that the child had active tuberculosis, since he\\nwas well, there was no calcification in the lungs, the\\nlower lobe was involved, and the sedimentation rate\\nwas low.\\nAspiration of a foreign body was a major consid-\\neration. We questioned family members on several\\noccasions, but they did not recall any episode that\\nsuggested the aspiration of a foreign body. The\\nphysical examination was unusual. There was bron-\\nchial breathing over the area of the right lower lobe.\\nThe pitch of the sound was lower than that of typi-\\ncal bronchial breathing and was similar to that asso-\\nciated with bronchial stenosis. The boy\\'s mother was\\nalso concerned about a whistling sound he made\\nwhile sleeping. We were not as convinced as Dr.\\nCleveland that there was an intrabronchial object\\npresent. We favored a congenital lesion such as se-\\nquestration that had been infected, resulting in\\nbronchiectasis, even though no feeding artery was\\nidentified on the CT scan. A bronchoscopy was per-\\nformed, however, to rule out a foreign body.\\nA flexible bronchoscope was inserted and revealed\\nan anatomical abnormality of the right lung (Fig. 3).\\nWhen the bronchoscope passed the carina, it en-\\ntered the right upper lobe easily, suggesting that the\\nmiddle and lower lobes had collapsed and that the\\nright-upper-lobe bronchus had rotated downward.\\nWe were puzzled initially. We then passed the bron-\\nchoscope into a stenotic bronchus intermedius and\\nfound only granulation tissue. As the bronchoscope\\nwas retracted, however, some of the surface granula-\\ntion tissue was removed, revealing a yellow surface\\nand suggesting the presence of a foreign body.\\nAt this point, we asked the boy\\'s father whether a\\nyellow piece of plastic \"had gone down the wrong\\nway.\" He immediately remembered that the child\\nhad had a severe coughing spasm after “swallowing\"\\na piece of plastic while wrapping Christmas presents.\\nThis event occurred just before his first episode of\\npneumonia.\\nA rigid bronchoscope was then introduced, but\\nwe were unable to remove the foreign body with\\nforceps because it was deeply embedded in the\\nbronchus. We concluded that a resection was re-\\nquired.\\nDR. MARK: A right-sided exploratory thoracotomy\\nwas performed. The surgeon incised the bronchus\\nintermedius and attempted to remove the foreign\\nobject with wide-angled forceps but was unsuccess-\\nful. The atelectatic, scarred right middle and lower\\nlobes were resected. The right bronchial tree re-\\nceives aspirated objects twice as frequently as the left\\nbecause it branches from the trachea at a less acute\\nangle.41\\nThe sectioned surface of the lung showed exten-\\nsive bronchiectasis (Fig. 4). Embedded within the\\nscarred bronchus was a pale-yellow plastic object\\n(Fig. 5), 12 mm long and shaped roughly like an ar-\\nrow. The conical head of the object was directed to-\\nward the distal end of the bronchus. The tail had four\\ncurved flanges that were directed toward the proxi-\\nmal end of the bronchus. The flanges were moder-\\nately pliable but were impacted in the bronchial wall,\\naccounting for the inability to remove the object ei-\\nther at bronchoscopy or at thoracotomy. The family\\ntold Dr. Kinane that in El Salvador this object is used\\nas a fastener when one is tying ribbons around pack-\\nages. The size, shape, and relative inflexibility of the\\nforeign object, which had a leading edge and trailing\\nfins, were remarkably similar to those of an aspirated\\nplastic top of a ballpoint pen that was pointed at one\\nend and frayed at the other, discussed at a previous\\nclinicopathological exercise.35 An inspired inflores-\\ncence of grass with the stem pointing forward into\\nthe bronchus and the spikes of seeds pointing back-\\nward has the same mechanical effect, preventing both\\nexpectoration and surgical extraction.42-44 A similar\\nmechanical effect may lead to the migration of an in-\\nhaled inflorescence or nail from the lung into the\\npericardium, diaphragm, or skin.45-47\\nBronchi proximal to, surrounding, and distal to\\nthe impacted plastic fastener had abnormal contours\\nand diameters, densely sclerotic walls with destruc-\\ntion of cartilage and hypertrophy of bronchial arter-\\nies, and inflamed and fibrotic mucosa (Fig. 6). These\\nchanges are characteristic of bronchiectasis,48 which\\nhas been recognized as a complication of aspirated\\nobjects for 50 years.49-52 In this case, the site of the\\nforeign body within the bronchus had a cushion of\\ngranulation tissue and an ulcerated surface, with ex-\\nudation of fibrin and neutrophils (Fig. 7). The gran-\\nulation tissue adhered to and obscured the fastener.\\nThe tissue response to a foreign body varies accord-\\ning to the composition of the aspirated material and\\nany associated bacterial infection. Vegetable frag-\\nments such as nuts and grains cause more acute in-\\nflammation than pieces of metal, plastic, or bone.\\nAbout 80 percent of foreign-body aspirations in\\nchildren occur in those under the age of six years,\\nand in most cases, the foreign bodies are organic.52\\nAtelectasis of the lung distal to the obstruction\\nwas probably due to two factors: a valvular effect of\\ngranulation tissue such that it allowed air to exit but\\nnot to enter and postinflammatory scarring. The ter-\\nminal bronchioles were surrounded by inflammation\\nand fibrosis with distal extension of respiratory epi-\\nthelium — findings indicative of bronchiolar scar-\\nring. Such scarring is always associated with bron-\\nchiectasis and ultimately results in blunt-ended, small\\nair tubes disconnected from alveoli, which become\\naerated by collateral ventilation.48 There was no evi-\\ndence of acute purulent bronchiolitis, bronchopneu-\\nmonia, or active or old tuberculosis in the lung. No\\nlymph nodes were sampled.\\nDR. CASAVANT: I saw the patient about five months\\nafter the thoracotomy. He was well and had stopped\\nmaking the whistling noise at night.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "The patient is an eight-year-old boy with a history of respiratory problems and bronchiectasis. The boy had been well until three months before admission, when he was seen by a physician because of a cough and low-grade fever. Chest radiographs (Fig. 1) showed densely opacified right lower and middle lobes, which were sharply marginated, associated with volume loss and areas of bronchiectasis. There was an area of poorly defined opacification in the left lower lobe. An antibiotic was prescribed, but repeated radiographs remained abnormal. Two months before admission, a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest (Fig. 2) revealed atelectasis and bronchiectasis of the right middle and lower lobes and scattered areas of air-space disease in the left upper lobe. A noncalcified endobronchial lesion was noted in the bronchus intermedius of the right lung, at the upper margin of the bronchiectatic segment. Examination of stool specimens showed cysts of Entamoeba coli and ova of Ascaris lumbricoides. The patient was referred to this hospital. The boy was a native of El Salvador. His health had been good until two years before admission, when he was admitted to another hospital because of pneumonia with night sweats and spikes of fever (temperature of up to 40°C). A tuberculin skin test was strongly positive, and he was treated with a triple-antibiotic regimen for tuberculosis, although no tubercle bacilli were detected in his sputum and there was no known source of exposure. He was discharged after six months and continued to receive treatment for a year. His family had immigrated to this country nine months before his admission. There was no history of recurrent respiratory tract infections or of aspiration, and the family history was unremarkable. The temperature was 37.4°C, the pulse was 98, and the respirations were 24. The blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg. The results of a physical examination were normal except for dullness and bronchial breathing over the right lung base and right axilla. The levels of urea nitrogen, creatinine, bilirubin, albumin, electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times were normal. The results of other hematologic laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Chest radiographs showed a right perihilar opacity, a finding consistent with the presence of pneumonia. Areas of serpiginous radiolucency in the medial portion of the right lung base were consistent with the presence of bronchiectasis. The mediastinum, heart, and bone appeared normal. A diagnostic procedure was performed.\n",

      "2) Hypothesis Generation — organize by anatomical system and by timing/progression; consider age and risk factors; generate a broad differential for tropical/infectious causes; apply illness scripts (e.g., dengue, malaria, leptospirosis, TB, rickettsioses, typhoid, chikungunya, Zika, acute HIV, etc.).\n",
      "The patient has a history of bronchiectasis, which is a chronic condition. The recent pneumonia and positive tuberculin skin test suggest a possible infectious etiology. The history of fever and night sweats could be consistent with TB, but the lack of sputum cultures and a known source of exposure makes this less likely. The history of aspiration is a significant risk factor for bronchiectasis. The patient's age (8 years old) makes aspiration a more likely cause of bronchiectasis than in adults. The patient's origin from El Salvador is relevant, as some tropical infections are endemic there. The presence of Entamoeba coli and Ascaris lumbricoides in the stool suggests parasitic infections, which can sometimes cause respiratory symptoms.\n",

      "The key features are the history of bronchiectasis, the recent pneumonia, the positive tuberculin skin test, and the history of aspiration.

The presence of Entamoeba coli and Ascaris lumbricoides suggests parasitic infections, which can sometimes cause respiratory symptoms. The patient's initial supportive care priorities should include antibiotics to treat the pneumonia and bronchodilators to relieve bronchospasm.

CLEVELAND*: The case history\\nindicates previous exposure to three organisms that\\nare endemic in El Salvador (the tubercle bacillus,\\nEnt. coli, and A. lumbricoides) and that may be relat-\\ned to this boy\\'s current illness.\\nThe diagnosis, I believe, lies in a few subtle find-\\nings on the chest films and CT scan. The films ob-\\ntained three months before admission (Fig. 1) show\\nsharply bordered, dense opacifications of the right\\nlower and middle lobes, a finding associated with\\nvolume loss, which indicates the presence of atelecta-\\nsis. Bronchiectasis is present within the involved ar-\\neas of the right lung. A poorly defined opacification\\nis present in the left lower lobe, a finding consistent\\nwith the presence of an area of remote air-space dis-\\nease, possibly due to pneumonia. The CT scan ob-\\ntained two months before admission (Fig. 2) con-\\nfirms the presence of atelectasis and bronchiectasis in\\nthe right middle and lower lobes and also shows fo-\\ncal alveolar opacifications within the lateral and lin-\\ngular segments of the left upper lobe. Particularly\\nnotable is a noncalcified endobronchial lesion in the\\nbronchus intermedius of the right lung, at the prox-\\nimal margin of the bronchiectatic segments (Fig. 2,\\nlower panel). An endobronchial lesion may be present\\nwithin the bronchus of the right middle lobe. There\\nis no evidence of calcified tissue, lymphadenopathy,\\na mass (except for the endobronchial lesion), or ab-\\nnormal vessels.\\nThe main finding, bronchiectasis, warrants the con-\\nsideration of anatomical, infectious, and other causes.\\nPossible anatomical disorders include a mass com-\\npressing a bronchus and causing chronic obstruction,\\nan endobronchial tumor, an anatomical abnormality\\nof the bronchus, the dysmotile cilia syndrome, Kartag-\\nener\\'s syndrome (dysmotile cilia with situs inversus),\\npulmonary sequestration, the Williams-Campbell\\nsyndrome (deficient bronchial cartilage), tracheomeg-\\naly, the Mounier-Kuhn syndrome (tracheobroncho-\\nmegaly), severe pectus excavatum, and scoliosis. Pos-\\nsible infectious disorders include previous measles,\\npertussis, or other viral infections; chronic pyogenic\\ninfection; tuberculosis or histoplasmosis; bronchio-\\nlitis obliterans; and allergic bronchopulmonary asper-\\ngillosis. In the third category are cystic fibrosis, asth-\\nma, genetic defects (including Marfan\\'s syndrome),\\nimmunodeficiency, heroin addiction, Young\\'s syn-\\ndrome (sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and azoospermia),\\naspiration of a foreign body, gastroesophageal reflux\\nwith aspiration, other causes of aspiration,1-4 lung\\ntransplantation,5,6 inhalation of toxic gases, familial or\\ncongenital disorders,8,9 and alpha-antitrypsin defi-\\nciency.10\\nSeveral diagnostic possibilities can be immediately\\nruled out, including previous viral infections, heroin\\naddiction, Young\\'s syndrome, genetic defects, lung\\ntransplantation, inhalation of toxic gases, and famil-\\nial or congenital disorders. Since the tracheobron-\\nchial system was normal except for bronchiectasis\\nand atelectasis of the right lung base, we can also\\nrule out anatomical abnormalities, Kartagener\\'s syn-\\ndrome (this boy\\'s heart is on the left side), trache-\\nomegaly, and the Mounier-Kuhn syndrome. Since\\nbronchiectasis was limited to the right lung base,\\ncystic fibrosis, the dysmotile cilia syndrome (with si-\\ntus solitus), and the Williams-Campbell syndrome\\nare unlikely. An immunodeficiency is improbable be-\\ncause the boy did not have multisystem infections\\nand was in generally good health, and allergic bron-\\nchopulmonary aspergillosis is unlikely because there\\nwas no history of reactive airway disease (asthma) or\\nevidence of cystic fibrosis. The absence of evidence\\nof emphysema or liver disease rules out alpha₁-anti-\\ntrypsin deficiency. Chronic unremitting bacterial\\npneumonia and gastroesophageal reflux with recur-\\nrent aspiration are not suggested by the history.\\nThere was also no history of exposure to mineral oil.\\nNo mass compressing a bronchus was seen on the\\nCT scan or the chest films. Bronchiolitis obliterans\\nis characterized by areas of relative hyperinflation\\nand decreased vascularity, which are often asymmet-\\nric findings that were absent in this case.11 There\\nwas no physical or radiographic evidence of scoliosis\\nor pectus excavatum, and the boy did not have the\\ncharacteristic body habitus of Marfan\\'s syndrome.\\nThe remaining possibilities are pulmonary seques-\\ntration, an endobronchial tumor, fibrogranuloma-\\ntous disease (tuberculosis or histoplasmosis), and as-\\npiration of a foreign body. Before discussing those\\ndiagnoses, I shall comment briefly on the two doc-\\numented parasitic infestations.\\nPneumonia associated with ascariasis is an acute\\ndisorder characterized by peripheral eosinophilia and\\nrapidly changing parenchymal opacifications a type\\nof Löffler\\'s syndrome.12 Since the boy had an eosin-\\nophil count of 1 percent and atypical pulmonary ra-\\ndiographic findings, ascariasis should be considered\\nas a possible, although unlikely, diagnosis. It has not\\nbeen associated with bronchiectasis.\\nAmebic infestation, however, has been accompa-\\nnied by bronchiectasis in rare cases. 13,14 The most\\ncommon route of pulmonary involvement is direct\\nextension from a hepatic amebic abscess, accounting\\nfor the high frequency of right-lower-lobe involve-\\nment. This boy\\'s liver was normal on CT scanning.\\nPulmonary involvement in the absence of a liver ab-\\nscess occurs infrequently, presumably as a result of\\nsystemic spread.13,14 The normal erythrocyte sedi-\\nmentation rate also makes amebic infestation unlike-\\nly in this case.\\nPulmonary sequestration is a spectrum of disor-\\nders characterized by a mass of abnormal pulmonary\\ntissue that does not communicate with the tracheo-\\nbronchial tree through a normally located bronchus\\nand is supplied by an abnormal feeding artery.15 Se-\\nquestration is classified as either extralobar or intra-\\nlobar. The extralobar type has its own pleural invest-\\nment, a feeding artery that is usually systemic but\\nmay be pulmonary, and a vein that drains into the\\nsystemic venous system, usually into the azygos or\\nhemiazygos vein. Eighty to 90 percent of extralobar\\nsequestrations are left-sided; they are more common\\nin males than in females and may communicate with\\nthe esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Other com-\\nmonly associated anomalies include diaphragmatic\\nhernia and eventration. Extralobar sequestrations\\nmay be found below the diaphragm and are usually\\ndiscovered incidentally, appearing as a persistent\\nbasilar opacification on chest films or on prenatal or\\nneonatal ultrasonographic examination.15,16\\nIn the past, an intralobar sequestration was con-\\nsidered a congenital lesion, with a feeding artery\\narising from the aorta or a major branch and a vein\\ndraining into the pulmonary venous system, with no\\nseparate pleural investment. Sixty percent of intralo-\\nbar sequestrations are left-sided, and most are within\\nthe posterior basilar segments of the lower lobes.\\nMales and females are affected in equal numbers. A\\nforegut communication and other associated anom-\\nalies are very rare. Intralobar sequestrations usually\\npresent with recurrent infection and are occasionally\\naccompanied by postinfectious bronchiectasis in old-\\ner children or adults. 15,16 The current opinion is that\\nthese sequestrations are not congenital and may in-\\nstead result from recurrent infection. The presence\\nof a normal connection with the tracheobronchial\\nsystem in many cases supports this view. Although\\nintralobar sequestration with postinfectious bron-\\nchiectasis is a possible diagnosis in this case, the ab-\\nsence of a recognizable feeding artery or draining\\nvein on the CT scan is evidence against it. Also, the\\ninvolvement of two lobes is uncharacteristic of the\\ndisorder.\\nThe presence of an endobronchial mass on the\\nCT scan suggests the diagnosis of an endobronchial\\ntumor, which is rare in children. Carcinoids and mu-\\ncoepidermoid carcinomas are the most common\\ntypes.17,18 Other reported types include inflammato-\\nry pseudotumor (plasma-cell granuloma),18 leiomy-\\noma,19 fibrosarcoma,18 rhabdomyosarcoma,18 hamar-\\ntoma, 20 fibrous histiocytoma,21 and schwannoma.22\\nIn advanced cases of juvenile laryngeal papillomato-\\nsis, there are multiple polypoid masses within the\\ntracheobronchial tree, and nodules, which can cavi-\\ntate, may be found within the lung parenchyma.\\nThere is one case report of an endobronchial polyp\\nassociated with a foreign body.23 Since the CT find-\\nings in this case suggest the possible presence of\\nmore than one endobronchial lesion and since bron-\\nchial tumors are rare in children, a neoplastic cause\\nis unlikely. The absence of diffuse tracheobronchial\\nand pulmonary parenchymal lesions rules out the di-\\nagnosis of papillomatosis.\\nAmong granulomatous infections, tuberculosis is\\nthe most likely, since the boy had had a positive tu-\\nberculin skin test. If there had been abnormal find-\\nings on a chest film obtained during his illness in El\\nSalvador, I assume they would have been reported in\\nthe medical record there. In primary tuberculosis,\\nperibronchial lymph nodes may become infected,\\nenlarge, and compress a bronchus, which leads to\\nobstruction and eventual bronchiectasis, or an in-\\nfected lymph node may erode directly into a bron-\\nchus and cause obstruction as an endobronchial for-\\neign body. When the intrabronchial node is calcified,\\nit is called a broncholith. With chronic obstruction,\\nbronchiectasis, or both, low-grade bacterial superin-\\nfection may lead to bronchogenic spread of infection\\nto other segments of the lung. The cause of the\\noriginal infection of the peribronchial lymph nodes\\nmay be unrelated to the organism responsible for the\\nlater pulmonary infection.1\\nIn children, only 17 percent of primary parenchy-\\nmal tuberculous lesions eventually calcify, as com-\\npared with 36 percent of infected lymph nodes.24 In\\nadolescents, calcification occurs over a period of five\\nyears or more; in younger children, it develops after\\na shorter period.25 Calcium may disappear in up to\\na third of previously calcified lesions.26 Therefore,\\nthe absence of calcium in the lung parenchyma, the\\nhilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and the endo-\\nbronchial lesion does not rule out the diagnosis of\\ntuberculosis. However, in cases of histoplasmosis,\\nmost, if not all, endobronchial masses that are com-\\nposed of peribronchial nodal tissue are calcified.27\\nThus, histoplasmosis is a less likely diagnosis than\\ntuberculosis.\\nIn children, endobronchial tuberculosis is usually\\na complication of primary tuberculosis.28 Although\\nwith modern medical management, most patients are\\ncured, late sequelae, including bronchiectasis, bron-\\nchial stricture, airless fibrotic segments, and bron-\\ncholiths, 1,29 have been reported in up to 68 percent\\nof patients. 29 In one series, bronchiectasis accounted\\nfor 39 percent of the late sequelae,29 and in another\\nseries, endobronchial masses accounted for 62 per-\\ncent of late complications. 28\\nYoung children often refuse to take medication,\\nespecially when they feel well. Had this boy been\\ntreated only at home, my leading diagnosis might\\nhave been tuberculosis. Since he was treated in the\\nhospital for six months, I must assume that he re-\\nceived adequate treatment. Also, there was a two-\\nyear hiatus between the treatment for tuberculosis\\nand the current three-month illness characterized by\\na cough and low-grade fever.\\nAlthough the case record does not include a his-\\ntory of aspiration, aspiration of one or more foreign\\nbodies is my leading diagnosis. In 16 to 46 percent\\nof cases in some series, aspiration of foreign bodies\\nin children was not recognized initially, 30-33 and no\\nhistory of aspiration was recorded in 14 to 25 percent\\nof cases. 30,31,34 Delayed diagnosis of an endobronchi-\\nal foreign body may result in bronchiectasis, atelec-\\ntasis, abscess formation, chronic pneumonia, bronchi-\\nal stenosis, empyema, and fistula formation.33,35,36 In\\na child with chronic cough and atelectasis, bronchial\\nobstruction from a foreign body should always be\\nconsidered as a possible diagnosis.33 Wheezing37,38\\nand hemoptysis33,35,36 are frequent symptoms.\\nUp to two thirds of cases of aspiration of foreign\\nbodies30,32,37,39 occur in boys, and peanuts account\\nfor approximately a third of the aspirated items.32,34,37,38\\nIn young children, aspiration involves the right and\\nleft lungs with approximately equal frequency, but\\nin older children, the right lung is more commonly\\ninvolved. 37,38,40 Multiple foreign bodies have been\\nrecovered in up to 5 percent of cases.39 About two\\nthirds of foreign bodies are lodged in the main\\nbronchi, and the remaining third are lodged distal-\\nly.38 Distal foreign bodies are more difficult to di-\\nagnose.31\\nAn endobronchial lesion is present in the bron-\\nchus intermedius in this patient, and there may be\\nanother lesion near the origin of the right-middle-\\nlobe bronchus. The density of the mass on the CT\\nscan is that of soft tissue and is therefore not specific.\\nA peanut or a grass inflorescence could have this ap-\\npearance. Although I do not recommend magnetic\\nresonance imaging to determine the nature of endo-\\nbronchial foreign bodies, it can detect the oil in a\\npeanut and might therefore allow a specific diagnosis.\\nMy final diagnosis is aspiration of one or more\\nforeign bodies, with postobstructive bronchiectasis\\nand a spillover of infection to other lung segments.\\nThe diagnostic procedure was probably a broncho-\\nscopic examination followed by resection of the af-\\nfected right lower and middle lobes.\\nDR. KON-TAIK KHAW: Does the finding of a\\nwell-defined area of atelectasis and bronchiectasis on\\nthe CT scan help reject or confirm the diagnosis of\\naspiration of a foreign body?\\nDR. CLEVELAND: The bronchiectasis, which was\\nfairly severe in this case, could be classified as cystic\\nbronchiectasis, suggesting that it was at least moder-\\nately chronic. Experimental studies have shown that\\nreversible, mild bronchial dilatation may develop if a\\nbronchus is transiently obstructed. However, with\\nongoing obstruction, particularly in association with\\nsuperimposed infection, the development of severe\\nbronchiectasis is much more likely. The severity of\\nthe bronchiectasis does not necessarily indicate the\\ncause of the obstruction, but peanuts and other veg-\\netable matter may exude toxins or swell as water in-\\nfiltrates the foreign body, and these effects, in turn,\\nmay be associated with severe bronchiectasis.\\nDR. JOHN BRADFORD: How do you explain the\\nchanges in the left lingula?\\nDR. CLEVELAND: A low-grade pyogenic superin-\\nfection of the bronchiectatic lung probably spread to\\nother segments, resulting in foci of pneumonia.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Dr. Casavant, as the pri-\\nmary physician, would you give us your impressions\\nas you cared for this boy?\\nDR. DAVID W. CASAVANT: He was referred to me\\nby the local public health office. Except for de-\\ncreased breath sounds at the right base, I did not\\nfind any abnormalities on examination. What con-\\ncerned me most was his history of tuberculosis. The\\nboy told me that his mother was not in El Salvador\\nwhen he was treated, and we did not have any of the\\nrecords from El Salvador at that time. Other diag-\\nnoses I considered were a vascular malformation,\\npulmonary sequestration, and a parasitic infection.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\n? Pulmonary sequestration.\\nDR. ROBERT H. CLEVELAND\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nAspiration of a foreign body, with postobstructive\\nbronchiectasis and infection of other lung seg-\\nments.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. MARK: Dr. Kinane, will you tell us your im-\\npressions at the time of admission and during the di-\\nagnostic procedure?\\nDR. T. BERNARD KINANE: We thought it was un-\\nlikely that the child had active tuberculosis, since he\\nwas well, there was no calcification in the lungs, the\\nlower lobe was involved, and the sedimentation rate\\nwas low.\\nAspiration of a foreign body was a major consid-\\neration. We questioned family members on several\\noccasions, but they did not recall any episode that\\nsuggested the aspiration of a foreign body. The\\nphysical examination was unusual. There was bron-\\nchial breathing over the area of the right lower lobe.\\nThe pitch of the sound was lower than that of typi-\\ncal bronchial breathing and was similar to that asso-\\nciated with bronchial stenosis. The boy\\'s mother was\\nalso concerned about a whistling sound he made\\nwhile sleeping. We were not as convinced as Dr.\\nCleveland that there was an intrabronchial object\\npresent. We favored a congenital lesion such as se-\\nquestration that had been infected, resulting in\\nbronchiectasis, even though no feeding artery was\\nidentified on the CT scan. A bronchoscopy was per-\\nformed, however, to rule out a foreign body.\\nA flexible bronchoscope was inserted and revealed\\nan anatomical abnormality of the right lung (Fig. 3).\\nWhen the bronchoscope passed the carina, it en-\\ntered the right upper lobe easily, suggesting that the\\nmiddle and lower lobes had collapsed and that the\\nright-upper-lobe bronchus had rotated downward.\\nWe were puzzled initially. We then passed the bron-\\nchoscope into a stenotic bronchus intermedius and\\nfound only granulation tissue. As the bronchoscope\\nwas retracted, however, some of the surface granula-\\ntion tissue was removed, revealing a yellow surface\\nand suggesting the presence of a foreign body.\\nAt this point, we asked the boy\\'s father whether a\\nyellow piece of plastic \"had gone down the wrong\\nway.\" He immediately remembered that the child\\nhad had a severe coughing spasm after “swallowing\"\\na piece of plastic while wrapping Christmas presents.\\nThis event occurred just before his first episode of\\npneumonia.\\nA rigid bronchoscope was then introduced, but\\nwe were unable to remove the foreign body with\\nforceps because it was deeply embedded in the\\nbronchus. We concluded that a resection was re-\\nquired.\\nDR. MARK: A right-sided exploratory thoracotomy\\nwas performed. The surgeon incised the bronchus\\nintermedius and attempted to remove the foreign\\nobject with wide-angled forceps but was unsuccess-\\nful. The atelectatic, scarred right middle and lower\\nlobes were resected. The right bronchial tree re-\\nceives aspirated objects twice as frequently as the left\\nbecause it branches from the trachea at a less acute\\nangle.41\\nThe sectioned surface of the lung showed exten-\\nsive bronchiectasis (Fig. 4). Embedded within the\\nscarred bronchus was a pale-yellow plastic object\\n(Fig. 5), 12 mm long and shaped roughly like an ar-\\nrow. The conical head of the object was directed to-\\nward the distal end of the bronchus. The tail had four\\ncurved flanges that were directed toward the proxi-\\nmal end of the bronchus. The flanges were moder-\\nately pliable but were impacted in the bronchial wall,\\naccounting for the inability to remove the object ei-\\nther at bronchoscopy or at thoracotomy. The family\\ntold Dr. Kinane that in El Salvador this object is used\\nas a fastener when one is tying ribbons around pack-\\nages. The size, shape, and relative inflexibility of the\\nforeign object, which had a leading edge and trailing\\nfins, were remarkably similar to those of an aspirated\\nplastic top of a ballpoint pen that was pointed at one\\nend and frayed at the other, discussed at a previous\\nclinicopathological exercise.35 An inspired inflores-\\ncence of grass with the stem pointing forward into\\nthe bronchus and the spikes of seeds pointing back-\\nward has the same mechanical effect, preventing both\\nexpectoration and surgical extraction.42-44 A similar\\nmechanical effect may lead to the migration of an in-\\nhaled inflorescence or nail from the lung into the\\npericardium, diaphragm, or skin.45-47\\nBronchi proximal to, surrounding, and distal to\\nthe impacted plastic fastener had abnormal contours\\nand diameters, densely sclerotic walls with destruc-\\ntion of cartilage and hypertrophy of bronchial arter-\\nies, and inflamed and fibrotic mucosa (Fig. 6). These\\nchanges are characteristic of bronchiectasis,48 which\\nhas been recognized as a complication of aspirated\\nobjects for 50 years.49-52 In this case, the site of the\\nforeign body within the bronchus had a cushion of\\ngranulation tissue and an ulcerated surface, with ex-\\nudation of fibrin and neutrophils (Fig. 7). The gran-\\nulation tissue adhered to and obscured the fastener.\\nThe tissue response to a foreign body varies accord-\\ning to the composition of the aspirated material and\\nany associated bacterial infection. Vegetable frag-\\nments such as nuts and grains cause more acute in-\\nflammation than pieces of metal, plastic, or bone.\\nAbout 80 percent of foreign-body aspirations in\\nchildren occur in those under the age of six years,\\nand in most cases, the foreign bodies are organic.52\\nAtelectasis of the lung distal to the obstruction\\nwas probably due to two factors: a valvular effect of\\ngranulation tissue such that it allowed air to exit but\\nnot to enter and postinflammatory scarring. The ter-\\nminal bronchioles were surrounded by inflammation\\nand fibrosis with distal extension of respiratory epi-\\nthelium — findings indicative of bronchiolar scar-\\nring. Such scarring is always associated with bron-\\nchiectasis and ultimately results in blunt-ended, small\\nair tubes disconnected from alveoli, which become\\naerated by collateral ventilation.48 There was no evi-\\ndence of acute purulent bronchiolitis, bronchopneu-\\nmonia, or active or old tuberculosis in the lung. No\\nlymph nodes were sampled.\\nDR. CASAVANT: I saw the patient about five months\\nafter the thoracotomy. He was well and had stopped\\nmaking the whistling noise at night.', 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"WORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Bronchiectasis, likely secondary to aspiration of a foreign body.\\n\\nDISEASE_NAME: Bronchiectasis\\n1) Information Gathering — key signs/symptoms and duration; epidemiologic context (travel, residence, occupation, exposures); relevant comorbidities/medications; red-flag features (e.g., hemorrhage, shock, AMS, jaundice).\\nThe patient is an eight-year-old boy with a history of respiratory problems and bronchiectasis. The boy had been well until three months before admission, when he was seen by a physician because of a cough and low-grade fever. Chest radiographs (Fig. 1) showed densely opacified right lower and middle lobes, which were sharply marginated, associated with volume loss and areas of bronchiectasis. There was an area of poorly defined opacification in the left lower lobe. An antibiotic was prescribed, but repeated radiographs remained abnormal. Two months before admission, a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest (Fig. 2) revealed atelectasis and bronchiectasis of the right middle and lower lobes and scattered areas of air-space disease in the left upper lobe. A noncalcified endobronchial lesion was noted in the bronchus intermedius of the right lung, at the upper margin of the bronchiectatic segment. Examination of stool specimens showed cysts of Entamoeba coli and ova of Ascaris lumbricoides. The patient was referred to this hospital. The boy was a native of El Salvador. His health had been good until two years before admission, when he was admitted to another hospital because of pneumonia with night sweats and spikes of fever (temperature of up to 40°C). A tuberculin skin test was strongly positive, and he was treated with a triple-antibiotic regimen for tuberculosis, although no tubercle bacilli were detected in his sputum and there was no known source of exposure. He was discharged after six months and continued to receive treatment for a year. His family had immigrated to this country nine months before his admission. There was no history of recurrent respiratory tract infections or of aspiration, and the family history was unremarkable. The temperature was 37.4°C, the pulse was 98, and the respirations were 24. The blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg. The results of a physical examination were normal except for dullness and bronchial breathing over the right lung base and right axilla. The levels of urea nitrogen, creatinine, bilirubin, albumin, electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal. The prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times were normal. The results of other hematologic laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Chest radiographs showed a right perihilar opacity, a finding consistent with the presence of pneumonia. Areas of serpiginous radiolucency in the medial portion of the right lung base were consistent with the presence of bronchiectasis. The mediastinum, heart, and bone appeared normal. A diagnostic procedure was performed.\\n\\n2) Hypothesis Generation — organize by anatomical system and by timing/progression; consider age and risk factors; generate a broad differential for tropical/infectious causes; apply illness scripts (e.g., dengue, malaria, leptospirosis, TB, rickettsioses, typhoid, chikungunya, Zika, acute HIV, etc.).\\nThe patient has a history of bronchiectasis, which is a chronic condition. The recent pneumonia and positive tuberculin skin test suggest a possible infectious etiology. The history of fever and night sweats could be consistent with TB, but the lack of sputum cultures and a known source of exposure makes this less likely. The history of aspiration is a significant risk factor for bronchiectasis. The patient's age (8 years old) makes aspiration a more likely cause of bronchiectasis than in adults. The patient's origin from El Salvador is relevant, as some tropical infections are endemic there. The presence of Entamoeba coli and Ascaris lumbricoides in the stool suggests parasitic infections, which can sometimes cause respiratory symptoms.\\n\\n3) Hypothesis Testing — identify defining vs. discriminatory features; propose point-of-care tests, labs, or imaging that would confirm or refute candidates; note potential diagnostic biases (anchoring, availability, framing) and how you mitigate them; mention early empiric considerations at a general level when appropriate.\\nThe key features are the history of bronchiectasis, the recent pneumonia, the positive tuberculin skin test, and the history of aspiration. The absence of sputum cultures and a known source of exposure makes TB less likely, but it cannot be ruled out completely. The presence of Entamoeba coli and Ascaris lumbricoides suggests parasitic infections, which can sometimes cause respiratory symptoms. The history of aspiration is a significant risk factor for bronchiectasis.\\nPoint-of-care tests:\\n*   Chest X-ray: To assess the extent of bronchiectasis and pneumonia.\\n*   Sputum culture: To rule out bacterial infection.\\n*   Tuberculin skin test: To assess for TB infection.\\n*   Stool examination: To rule out parasitic infections.\\nLabs:\\n*   Complete blood count: To assess for infection or inflammation.\\n*   Liver function tests: To assess for liver involvement.\\n*   Kidney function tests: To assess for kidney involvement.\\n*   Inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR): To assess for inflammation.\\nImaging:\\n*   CT scan of the chest: To assess the extent of bronchiectasis and to rule out other causes of respiratory symptoms.\\n*   Bronchoscopy: To visualize the airways and to obtain samples for culture and biopsy.\\nThe patient's history of aspiration is a significant risk factor for bronchiectasis. The absence of a known source of exposure makes TB less likely, but it cannot be ruled out completely. The presence of Entamoeba coli and Ascaris lumbricoides suggests parasitic infections, which can sometimes cause respiratory symptoms. The history of aspiration is a significant risk factor for bronchiectasis.\\n\\n4) Reflection & Final Diagnosis — re-assess fit with expected disease course; consider multi-system disease or co-infection; state the most likely diagnosis and briefly outline initial supportive care priorities and warning signs to monitor.\\nThe most likely diagnosis is bronchiectasis secondary to aspiration. The history of aspiration, the presence of bronchiectasis, and the recent pneumonia all support this diagnosis. The positive tuberculin skin test is less specific and could be due to prior exposure or a false-positive test. The presence of Entamoeba coli and Ascaris lumbricoides suggests parasitic infections, which can sometimes cause respiratory symptoms. The patient's initial supportive care priorities should include antibiotics to treat the pneumonia and bronchodilators to relieve bronchospasm. The patient should be monitored for signs of worsening respiratory symptoms, such as increased cough, shortness of breath, and fever. The patient should also be monitored for signs of complications of bronchiectasis, such as recurrent infections and hemoptysis.\\nWORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Bronchiectasis, likely secondary to aspiration of a foreign body.\\n\\nDISEASE_NAME: Bronchiectasis\\n\", 'original_file': 'NEJM199810153391608.json'}\n",

There was a long history of hyper-\\ntension and a 10-year history of atrial fibrillation for\\nwhich she received no treatment. For two years she\\nhad had type 2 diabetes mellitus and unstable angina\\npectoris. She had never smoked and had no history\\nof tuberculosis, recent chest pain, chronic cough or\\nproduction of sputum, fever, symptoms of gastro-\\nesophageal reflux or aspiration, or recent travel. A\\nchest radiograph obtained elsewhere two months\\nbefore admission showed normal findings.\\nOne month before admission, the patient experi-\\nenced a worsening of long-standing exertional dysp-\\nnea, with the subsequent onset of coughing. Radio-\\ngraphs of the chest obtained at another hospital\\nshowed a few linear opacities in the left lower lung. A\\ncomputed tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax re-\\nvealed mild cylindrical bronchiectasis at both lung\\nbases. A cardiac ultrasonographic examination showed\\na left ventricular ejection fraction of 65 percent,\\nmild mitral and tricuspid insufficiency with biatrial\\nenlargement, and normal motion of the left ventric-\\nular wall. The glucose concentration ranged from\\n400 to 500 mg per deciliter (20 to 30 mmol per li-\\nter). Cultures of blood and urine specimens showed\\nno growth of organisms. Bronchodilator medica-\\ntions, methylprednisolone (40 mg given intrave-\\nnously three times a day), clindamycin, ciprofloxa-\\ncin, metronidazole, and warfarin were administered,\\nbut the cough and dyspnea persisted. On the 14th\\nhospital day, a radiograph of the chest showed\\npatchy, nodular consolidation in both lungs. The pa-\\ntient was transferred to this hospital.\\nThe temperature was 35.8°C, the pulse was 92,\\nand the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was\\n150/90 mm Hg.\\nExamination revealed a jugular venous pressure of\\n9 cm of water and bilateral diffuse pulmonary rhon-\\nchi with intermittent wheezes. The heart rhythm\\nwas irregular. There was an indwelling catheter.\\nThe urine was positive for protein (+) and glu-\\ncose (+++); the sediment contained 4 white cells\\nand innumerable red cells per high-power field. Lab-\\noratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). An\\nelectrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at a ven-\\ntricular rate of 121. A radiograph of the chest re-\\nvealed an increase in the bilateral nodular and patchy\\nconsolidations. Microscopical examination of a stained\\nspecimen of sputum showed no acid-fast bacilli. A\\nurine test for legionella antigen was negative.\\nSpecimens of blood, sputum, and urine were ob-\\ntained for culture. Clindamycin and warfarin were\\ncontinued, and diltiazem, digoxin, verapamil, furosem-\\nide, sucralfate, insulin, isosorbide, and glycopyrrolate\\nwere given, with prednisone administered at an ini-\\ntial dose of 60 mg daily and rapidly tapered. Oxy-\\ngen was administered by nasal prongs, with an oxy-\\ngen saturation of 95 percent. The temperature was\\nnormal on most occasions. The patient coughed up\\nyellow sputum for the first several days. Repeated\\nphysical examinations showed wheezing and bi-\\nlateral crackles that remained more prominent on\\nthe right side. The urine culture yielded abundant\\nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; two blood\\ncultures were sterile, and a sputum culture yielded\\nrespiratory tract flora and a few colonies of Asper-\\ngillus fumigatus. On the fourth hospital day, hema-\\ntologic laboratory tests were performed (Table 1).\\nA radiograph of the chest showed increased density\\nof the right basilar consolidations. On the following\\nday, a D-dimer test was positive (more than 8 µg per\\nmilliliter). Another radiograph of the chest (Fig. 1)\\nrevealed an increase in the bilateral consolidations.\\nA CT scan of the chest (Fig. 2) showed multifocal\\nconsolidations; some were poorly defined, but others\\nwere nodular. The largest nodule, 4 cm in diameter,\\nwas in the right upper lobe; precarinal, paratracheal,\\nand subcarinal lymph nodes were 1 to 2 cm in di-\\nameter. Evidence of bronchiectasis was obscured by\\nthe extensive consolidations. Warfarin was discon-\\ntinued, and vancomycin was added.\\nOn the sixth hospital day, laboratory tests were\\nperformed (Tables 1 and 2). A barium-swallow ex-\\namination showed no findings suggestive of aspira-\\ntion. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin,\\nand gentamicin were administered. That evening, ar-\\nterial-blood gases were measured (Table 3). A radio-\\ngraph of the chest showed an increase in the patchy\\nbilateral consolidations, which were more coalescent\\nin the right lung. The patient's breathing improved\\nafter an injection of furosemide.\\nOn the seventh hospital day, the cough persisted\\nbut produced little or no sputum. The urine was\\nnormal, except that the sediment contained 10 to 20\\nred cells and 4 white cells per high-power field. Lab-\\noratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2).\\nThree blood cultures remained sterile, and micro-\\nscopical examination of two specimens of sputum\\nshowed no acid-fast bacilli. Fiberoptic bronchoscop-\\nic examination showed mucosal edema with puru-\\nlent secretions in the right main bronchus. Further\\nexamination was curtailed because of respiratory in-\\nstability. Microscopical examination of a bronchoal-\\nveolar-lavage specimen from the right middle lobe\\nrevealed very few septate hyphae, moderate numbers\\nof neutrophils, a few yeast forms, and rare gram-\\npositive cocci in pairs. Examination of a lavage spec-\\nimen from the right lower lobe showed very rare\\nseptate hyphae, moderate numbers of neutrophils,\\nand a few yeast forms; rare gram-positive cocci in\\nclusters and very rare gram-positive cocci in chains\\nwere present. Wet-mount preparations of specimens\\nfrom both the middle and lower lobes showed bud-\\nding yeasts, pseudohyphae, and septate hyphae. No\\nacid-fast bacilli or Pneumocystis carinii microorgan-\\nisms were detected in a lavage specimen from the\\nright lower lobe. Cytologic examination showed no\\ntumor cells.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. RICHARD L. KRADIN*: We are faced with the\\nproblem of determining the cause of a rapidly pro-\\ngressing pneumonia in an elderly woman with asth-\\nma. She had been in good health before her admis-\\nsion to the hospital, except for asthma that began\\nduring childhood and the relatively recent onset of\\natrial fibrillation and type 2 diabetes mellitus.\\nMay we review the chest radiographs?\\nDR. ELIZABETH A. DRUCKER: A CT scan ob-\\ntained at the first hospital shows mild cylindrical\\nbronchiectasis at both lung bases. A chest radio-\\ngraph (Fig. 1), obtained two weeks later, reveals\\nnodular, patchy consolidation in both lungs. A tho-\\nracic CT scan (Fig. 2) shows asymmetric bilateral\\nconsolidation and multiple enlarged precarinal, para-\\ntracheal, and subcarinal lymph nodes. The consoli-\\ndation in the right lung became more confluent over\\nthe next several days, and diffuse air-space disease\\ndeveloped in the left lung.\\nDR. KRADIN: In formulating a diagnosis, I must\\nconsider the age of the patient, her underlying im-\\nmune status, and the distribution and course of the\\ndisease. The patient had a well-established history of\\nasthma dating back to childhood. In my opinion,\\nthere is little to suggest that her initial hospitaliza-\\ntion was precipitated by a disorder other than the\\nasthma, but we do not know whether the asthma\\nwas episodic or sustained. Furthermore, we do not\\nknow whether she had been taking corticosteroids\\non a long-term basis as an outpatient.\\nAsthma is defined physiologically as an episodic,\\nreversible disorder of bronchomotor tone. The caus-\\native factors are both allergic and nonimmune. Ato-\\npy, as evidenced by increased IgE levels and imme-\\ndiate hypersensitivity on skin testing, predominates\\nin childhood asthma; in contrast, nonallergic, or in-\\ntrinsic, asthma is associated with an older age and a\\ntendency toward intractable bronchospasm. This\\nwoman's childhood history of asthma suggests an al-\\nlergic basis, but the more recent history does not.\\nA variety of factors can trigger asthma: analgesics,\\ngastroesophageal reflux, severe dysphoria, environ-\\nmental pollutants, alcohol, and certain foods. Infec-\\ntions by viruses, including influenzavirus, rhinovirus,\\nand respiratory syncytial virus, have been implicated\\nin most exacerbations of asthma in childhood. How-\\never, evidence of antecedent viral infections is found\\nin only 10 percent of adults with acute exacerbations\\nof asthma.\\nViral infections can impair the already compro-\\nmised clearance of airway pathogens in patients with\\nasthma, conferring a predisposition to infections of\\nthe lower respiratory tract. Indeed, the bimodal\\ncourse of the disease in this patient an acute ep-\\nisode of asthma in the absence of parenchymal dis-\\nease followed days later by serious pneumonia\\nsuggests an infectious complication.\\nBefore considering the nature of this complica-\\ntion, I shall discuss other diseases that involve asth-\\nma with parenchymal infiltrates at presentation.\\nAsthma can accompany a variety of disorders associ-\\nated with pulmonary eosinophilia, including Löf-\\nfler's syndrome and other variants of eosinophilic\\npneumonia, as well as systemic vascular disorders,\\nincluding the Churg-Strauss syndrome and polyar-\\nteritis nodosa. These diagnoses are unlikely in this\\ncase, however, since the patient presented without\\nradiographic evidence of diffuse infiltrates or periph-\\neral eosinophilia.\\nThe rapid course of the disease and the negative\\nfindings on cytologic examination do not suggest\\nthe presence of a neoplasm, although certain pulmo-\\nnary infiltrative disorders, especially lymphoma and\\nsarcoidosis, can produce nodular radiographic infil-\\ntrates and wheezing if the pulmonary airways are di-\\nrectly involved.\\nPulmonary embolic disease must be considered in\\na hospitalized elderly woman with chronic atrial fi-\\nbrillation. In this case, there was a sporadic increase\\nin the plasma level of D-dimers, a finding consistent\\nwith the formation of intravascular clots and fibri-\\nnolysis. Pulmonary embolic disease may be associated\\nwith episodic bronchospasm and normal findings on\\nchest films. Air-space hemorrhage and pulmonary in-\\nfarction caused by chronic pulmonary emboli could\\nhave accounted for the development of bilateral in-\\nfiltrates. These processes are unlikely, however, in view\\nof the relatively normal blood oxygen values initially,\\nthe nodular appearance of the infiltrates, and the pro-\\ngression of the disease despite anticoagulation therapy.\\nThe most likely diagnosis is an infection. The\\nscanty sputum production and the failure to isolate\\nan infectious agent after multiple attempts argue\\nagainst the presence of common bacterial pathogens.\\nNodular pneumonia can result from infection with\\nmycobacteria or legionella, but these pathogens were\\nnot detected in this case. Infection with P. carinii\\ncan be associated with a variety of radiographic find-\\nings, but the bronchoalveolar-lavage specimens were\\nnegative for this organism.\\nThe presence of aspergillus species in a sputum\\nculture requires an explanation. Aspergillus is found\\nin water, soil, aerosols, and decaying organic matter.\\nA. fumigatus, A. niger, and A. flavus account for most\\ncases of clinical disease. Under conditions of high\\noxygen tension, which may occur in patients with as-\\npergillomas or aspergillus sinus infections, conidio-\\nphores, or fruiting bodies, may develop. They closely\\nresemble the Roman Catholic aspergillum (used to\\nsprinkle holy water), for which the fungus is named.\\nSince aspergillus species are widespread in the envi-\\nronment, growth on culture must always be inter-\\npreted in the context of the clinical presentation.\\nUnder most conditions, aspergillus hyphae are\\nseptate, with asymmetric dichotomous branching at\\n45-degree angles to the long axis of the organism.\\nAlthough this appearance is characteristic, it may be\\nimpossible to distinguish aspergillus morphological-\\nly from Pseudoallescheria boydii or the fusarium, al-\\nternaria, or Bipolarina fungal species. Fruiting bod-\\nies in tissue specimens, however, are diagnostic of\\naspergillus species.¹\\nThere are three major types of pulmonary patho-\\ngen-host interactions involving aspergillus organ-\\nisms2 (Table 4). The most clinically benign interac-\\ntion is saprophytic colonization of the pulmonary\\nairways, which may accompany chronic diseases of\\nthe airways associated with defective mucociliary\\nclearance, inspissation of mucus, and structural chang-\\nes in the bronchial wall. These diseases include asth-\\nma, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and cystic fi-\\nbrosis. Invasive aspergillosis does not develop in most\\npatients with these diseases, but immunosuppression\\nconfers a susceptibility to tissue invasion.\\nAspergillomas, or fungus balls, can form in areas\\nwhere pulmonary cysts have developed, most often\\nin healed tuberculous cavities or in the emphysema-\\ntous bullae or cystic lesions of sarcoidosis. In pa-\\ntients with this second type of pathogen-host inter-\\naction, an intracavitary nidus composed of fungus\\nand detritic lung tissue is identified radiologically\\nand may be seen to move within the cavity when the\\npatient changes position. Fruiting bodies may be de-\\ntected by histologic studies, with crystals of calcium\\noxalate identified between the mycelial layers. IgG\\nprecipitins to aspergillomas are detected in serum\\nsamples from 90 percent of patients with this type\\nof pathogen-host interaction. Most aspergillomas\\nare clinically silent, but some may result in cough\\nand hemoptysis, requiring surgical excision.\\nFinally, allergic responses to aspergillus may cause\\nclinical manifestations of pulmonary disease. Hyper-\\nsensitivity pneumonitis was first described in malt\\nworkers who had fever, leukocytosis, and pulmonary\\ninfiltrates within hours after exposure to the spores\\nof A. clavatus. As in most types of hypersensitivity\\npneumonitis, pathological examination of the lung\\nshows a lymphocytic and granulomatous alveolitis.\\nAsthma itself may be caused by an IgE-mediated\\nhypersensitivity response to aspergillus mold. This\\nform of asthma is an occupational hazard for some\\nfood preparers, particularly bakers who are susceptible\\nto asthma and who may be exposed to food addi-\\ntives in the form of enzymes produced by aspergillus\\norganisms. A related disorder, allergic bronchopul-\\nmonary aspergillosis, is characterized by asthma, the\\npresence of IgG precipitins to aspergillus, elevated\\nIgE levels, immediate reactivity to aspergillus on\\nskin testing, and central bronchiectasis, often with\\nmucoid impaction. Patients with preexisting asthma\\nor cystic fibrosis are at especially high risk for this\\ndisorder. Symptoms include wheezing, increased\\nsputum production with the expectoration of mu-\\ncous plugs laden with eosinophils, and occasionally,\\nfever, weight loss, and night sweats.\\nThe diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary as-\\npergillosis is confirmed on the basis of various clin-\\nical findings. Almost all patients have immediate re-\\nsponses to aspergillus extracts on skin testing. IgG\\nprecipitins are elevated, but this is not a specific find-\\ning, since IgG precipitins can be elevated in other\\nforms of pulmonary aspergillosis. Peripheral-blood\\neosinophilia is common. However, the most distinc-\\ntive feature of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillo-\\nsis is central bronchiectasis, with eosinophilic pneu-\\nmonia adjacent to areas of bronchiectasis with\\nmucoid impaction. Fragmented hyphal forms may\\nbe seen within the mucous plugs. Bronchocentric\\ngranulomatosis, a necrotizing granulomatous re-\\nsponse limited to the airway wall, or exudative bron-\\nchiolitis may be seen. Corticosteroids are the main-\\nstay of treatment, and there is little evidence that\\nfungicidal therapy is effective.\\nThe most malignant forms of aspergillus infection\\nare those that develop in persons with impaired im-\\nmunity and result in invasion and necrosis of pulmo-\\nnary tissue. A chronic necrotizing form of as-\\npergillosis that has been described appears to reflect\\na response intermediate in severity between that of\\nallergic aspergillosis and fulminant invasive disease.\\nPatients generally have an identifiable underlying\\nstructural deformity of the lung due to chronic air-\\nway disease, sarcoidosis, extensive interstitial fibrosis,\\nor aspergilloma, along with mild immunologic def-\\nicits due to diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid therapy,\\nalcoholism, or advanced age. Cavitary pneumonia\\npredominantly involving the upper lobe is the most\\ncommon presentation, and secondary aspergilloma\\nformation has been reported. Vascular spread of in-\\nfection is not a feature, however, and the disease lasts\\nfor months or years. Sputum cultures for aspergillus\\nmay be positive, but lung biopsy is required for a de-\\nfinitive diagnosis. Treatment includes systemic anti-\\nfungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine\\nor itraconazole. Surgical resection may be curative in\\ncases of limited disease.\\nI believe that the diagnosis in this case is invasive\\npulmonary aspergillosis. This feared form of infec-\\ntion is limited to the severely immunocompromised\\nhost who has marked neutropenia (less than 500 neu-\\ntrophils per cubic millimeter), neutrophil dysfunction\\ndue to chronic granulomatous disease, or iatrogenic\\nimmunosuppression due to treatment with cortico-\\nsteroids, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or broad-spectrum\\nantibiotics. The patient under discussion was probably\\nseverely immunosuppressed as a result of the combi-\\nnation of treatment with corticosteroids and broad-\\nspectrum antibiotics, hyperglycemia, and advanced\\nage. Invasive aspergillosis has also been documented,\\nhowever, in a patient with chronic obstructive pul-\\nmonary disease after a short intravenous course of\\ncorticosteroids.3 In two other patients with chronic\\nobstructive pulmonary disease, invasive aspergillosis\\ndeveloped after the air filters in their hospital rooms\\nhad been replaced.4 Inadequate filtration apparently\\nallowed an unusually high level of exposure to as-\\npergillus, a risk factor for invasive aspergillosis.\\nThe radiographic characteristics of invasive as-\\npergillosis generally reflect the underlying patho-\\nlogical features. The pulmonary disease is usually\\nmultifocal but may progress, as in this case, to con-\\nsolidate a segment or an entire lobe of the lung.\\nNodular disease, if present, suggests invasion of blood\\nvessels by the organism.5 Vascular invasion may pro-\\nduce radiographically detectable target lesions with\\ncentral necrosis of lung tissue and a characteristic\\nhemorrhagic rim. The lung may also undergo ische-\\nmic infarction due to thrombosis of medium-sized\\npulmonary arteries. Areas of necrotic lung are prone\\nto cavitation, which may promote further fungal\\ngrowth.\\nThe association of air-space disease with local ar-\\nterial thrombosis results in decreased ventilation and\\nperfusion in the same area of the lung. This combi-\\nnation probably accounts for the relatively small loss\\nof arterial oxygenation in this case, despite radio-\\ngraphic evidence of considerable lung involvement.\\nBlood-borne spread of organisms, which occurs in\\n25 to 33 percent of cases, is a very serious compli-\\ncation, because vital organs, including the brain,\\nheart, kidneys, and liver, are susceptible to hemor-\\nrhagic or embolic infarction and the development of\\nnew foci of infection. An unusual and noninfectious\\ncomplication is acute renal failure due to the depo-\\nsition of calcium oxalate crystals in renal tubules.\\nThe definitive diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis\\nrequires the identification of the fungi in lung tissue.\\nWhen the radiographic and clinical features suggest\\ninvasion, the repeated isolation of organisms from\\nsputum or bronchoalveolar-lavage specimens is\\nclosely correlated with biopsy confirmation of the\\ndiagnosis, but bronchoalveolar lavage yields organ-\\nisms in only about 50 percent of patients with the\\ndisease.7 The detection of circulating aspergillus an-\\ntigens may be a sensitive indicator of vascular inva-\\nsion. The elevated D-dimer level in this patient was\\nprobably related to intravascular thrombosis trig-\\ngered by the invading organisms. It would be inter-\\nesting to know whether elevated D-dimer levels\\ncommonly accompany invasive pulmonary infection.\\nAspergillus secretes a large number of factors,\\nsome of which may have a role in its virulence.\\nElastase and chymotrypsin-like proteinases can pro-\\nmote tissue invasion. Endotoxins, ribotoxins, and\\ngliotoxins also promote pathogenicity. Since innate\\ncellular immunity mediated by neutrophils and mac-\\nrophages is the main pathway of the host defense,\\nwhatever suppresses the activities of these cells, in-\\ncluding factors secreted by the organism itself, can\\ncontribute to tissue invasion.\\nAmphotericin B remains the mainstay of treat-\\nment for aspergillus infections, although flucytosine,\\nitraconazole, and terbinafine are also active against\\nthe organism. Surgery may be indicated for early lo-\\ncalized disease but is largely used to control the he-\\nmoptysis that can accompany vascular invasion and\\nlung infarction.\\nEither a video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy or an\\nopen-lung biopsy probably established the diagnosis\\nin this case. I believe that airway colonization, possi-\\nbly in a bronchiectatic segment of the right lower\\nlobe, combined with the patient's immunosuppressed\\ncondition, ultimately resulted in fungal air-space in-\\nfection that progressed to pulmonary vascular inva-\\nsion. With extensive pulmonary disease, metastatic\\nsites of infection are likely to develop, and such me-\\ntastases may have been a tertiary complication of this\\npatient's illness. I attribute the finding of pseudohy-\\nphae in the bronchoalveolar-lavage specimens to air-\\nway colonization by Candida albicans, but I cannot\\nrule out a concomitant candidal invasion.\\nUnfortunately, the rate of death from invasive pul-\\nmonary aspergillosis remains high despite aggressive\\nmedical therapy. In one study, the initiation of anti-\\nfungal treatment more than 10 days after the radio-\\ngraphic detection of disease was associated with a 90\\npercent mortality rate, 10 although earlier interven-\\ntions reduced the rate to 41 percent.\\nDR. ATUL MALHOTRA: The pulmonary consulta-\\ntion service favored the diagnosis of invasive pulmo-\\nnary aspergillosis, but our differential diagnosis also\\nincluded bronchocentric granulomatosis and chron-\\nic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis with bacterial\\nsuperinfection.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nInvasive pulmonary aspergillosis.\\nDR. RICHARD L. KRADIN'S DIAGNOSIS\\nInvasive pulmonary aspergillosis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: An exploratory right-sid-\\ned thoracotomy revealed many old pleural adhesions\\ncaused by previous bouts of pneumonia. A single\\nnodule in the superior segment of the right lower\\nlobe was aspirated for culture and then resected. The\\nnodule consisted of a cavity lined with necrotic tis-\\nsue, which was surrounded by dense inflammatory\\ntissue (Fig. 3). Necrotic tissue abutted an elastic pul-\\nmonary artery (Fig. 4). Inflammatory cells extended\\ninto the media and caused intimal hyperplasia, but\\nthe arterial wall remained intact. Necrotizing pneu-\\nmonia with an exudation of fibrin and neutrophils\\nwas present in some areas that were not adjacent to\\nthe nodule. Branching hyphae of aspergillus (Fig. 5)\\nwere present in the necrotic layer of the nodule and\\nin the nonadjacent areas of necrotizing pneumonia.\\nThe hyphae were highlighted by a silver stain (Fig.\\n6). Culture grew A. fumigatus. Some terminal bron-\\nchioles were plugged with mucus, necrotic histio-\\ncytes, and hyphae (Fig. 7), with erosion of epithelial\\nmetaplasia similar to that associated with broncho-\\ncentric granulomatosis. However, the palisading his-\\ntiocytes and eosinophils that are typical of that con-\\ndition were not present.\\nAfter the lung biopsy, antifungal therapy was ad-\\nministered, but the patient had increasing hyper-\\ntension and hypoxia. A bone marrow biopsy was\\nperformed to rule out leukemia and lymphoma. A\\nscanty bone marrow specimen revealed myeloid hy-\\nperplasia. Acute renal failure developed. The patient\\ndied on the 12th day in this hospital (the 26th day\\nof the combined hospitalization). Permission for an\\nautopsy was not obtained.\\nThis case is an example of a community-acquired\\npneumonia due to aspergillus.11 Invasive aspergillosis\\nis not common in immunocompetent patients but is\\nwell described.12-19 It can complicate viral pneu-\\nmonia in previously healthy persons. 20,21 The history\\nof asthma and recurrent pneumonia and the finding\\nof bronchiectasis are characteristic of various forms\\nof chronic intrabronchial aspergillosis, including bron-\\nchocentric granulomatosis, which can progress to a\\nchronic aspergillus pneumonia and even to tissue in-\\nvasion with cavitary necrosis. The clinicopathologi-\\ncal spectrum of aspergillus lung disease, including\\nthe chronic necrotizing forms, has been expanded\\nover the past three decades.22-27\\nThe severity of the conditions associated with\\nchronic necrotizing aspergillosis is generally inter-\\nmediate between those associated with the allergic\\nand the septic forms. These conditions include pul-\\nmonary aspergilloma with early invasion, bronchial\\ncolonization by aspergillus with early invasion, lobar\\npneumonia, aspergillosis with cavitary necrosis, and\\nsequestrum of lung in cavitary aspergillosis. 28,29 Al-\\nlergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis30 and aspergil-\\nloma31,32 can progress to invasive aspergillosis. This\\ncase is notable because of the presence of chronic\\nnecrotizing aspergillosis with cavitary necrosis and\\nelements of bronchocentric granulomatosis and in-\\nvasion. The terminal event was probably hematoge-\\nnous dissemination of the organism to the kidneys\\nand other viscera.\\nDR. DAVID R. SCHWARTZ: Can you distinguish\\nchronic necrotizing aspergillosis from invasive pul-\\nmonary aspergillosis on the basis of the pathological\\nchanges you have described?\\nDR. MARK: Invasive aspergillosis is generally asso-\\nciated with extensive invasion of blood vessels and\\nembolic spread, with little or no cellular or fibrous\\nreaction. In contrast, chronic necrotizing aspergillo-\\nsis is generally characterized by local penetration\\ninto tissue, but this process is contained by a cellular\\nor fibrous reaction.\\nDR. SCHWARTZ: Are there any prospective data\\non patients with saprophytic or hypersensitivity\\nforms of pulmonary aspergillosis in whom the infec-\\ntion progressed to the invasive form despite the ab-\\nsence of a clear-cut immunosuppressive status? Pre-\\nsumably such patients initially would have a greater\\nquantity of aspergillus in their lungs.\\nDR. KRADIN: I am not aware of any data of that\\ntype. Although this case is not an example of classic\\nimmunosuppression, retrospective analysis uncovers\\na constellation of findings that could have resulted\\nin substantial immunosuppression, particularly sup-\\npression of innate immunity. Phagocytosis by mac-\\nrophages and neutrophils is compromised by ad-\\nvanced age, marked hyperglycemia, a history of\\nasthma, underlying pulmonary disease, the use of\\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics, and the persistent pres-\\nence of the organism itself.33 All these factors prob-\\nably resulted in immunosuppression of a degree suf-\\nficient to permit the development of invasive\\ndisease.34 Do we know whether the patient had been\\ntaking corticosteroids for a long period as an outpa-\\ntient?\\nDR.

      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Information Gathering:**\n",
      "    *   **Age:** 83-year-old, elderly patient.\n",
      "    *   **Underlying Conditions:** Asthma, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, unstable angina. These conditions increase the risk of infection and complications.\n",
      "    *   **Symptoms:** Progressive dyspnea, cough, fever (though temperature is normal on most occasions), patchy, nodular consolidation in both lungs on chest radiograph, and CT scan showing multifocal consolidations with lymphadenopathy.\n",
      "    *   **Investigations:** Chest radiographs showing nodular consolidation, CT scan showing multifocal consolidations and enlarged lymph nodes, positive urine protein and glucose, elevated D-dimer, and microscopic examination of sputum showing septate hyphae, pseudohyphae, and budding yeasts.\n",
      "    *   **Treatment Response:** Unresponsive to antibiotic treatment, but improved with corticosteroids and other supportive measures.\n",
      "    *   **Red Flags:** The rapid progression of the pneumonia, the presence of multiple lung lesions, and the patient's immunocompromised state (elderly, multiple comorbidities, and corticosteroid use) are all concerning for a serious infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Infectious Causes:** Given the patient's age, comorbidities, and the presence of lung lesions, we need to consider a range of infectious causes, including:\n",
      "        *   **Bacterial Pneumonia:** While the patient was initially treated with antibiotics, the lack of response suggests a non-bacterial cause.\n",
      "        *   **Fungal Pneumonia:** Aspergillus is a common cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals.\n",
      "        *   **Viral Pneumonia:** While less likely given the nodular consolidation, it should be considered.\n",
      "        *   **Tuberculosis:** Although the sputum stain was negative for acid-fast bacilli, TB should still be considered, especially in an elderly patient.\n",
      "        *   **Other opportunistic infections:** Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is less likely given the negative PCP stain.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Non-Infectious Causes:**\n",
      "        *   **Lung Cancer:** The nodular consolidation could be a sign of lung cancer, but the rapid progression of the pneumonia makes this less likely.\n",
      "        *   **Pulmonary Embolism:** The positive D-dimer suggests a possible pulmonary embolism, but the clinical picture is more consistent with pneumonia.\n",
      "        *   **Drug-Induced Pneumonitis:** The patient was on several medications, but none are strongly associated with pneumonitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Aspergillus Pneumonia:** The presence of septate hyphae, pseudohyphae, and budding yeasts in the sputum is highly suggestive of Aspergillus infection. The nodular consolidation on chest imaging is also consistent with this diagnosis.\n",
      "    *   **Invasive Aspergillosis:** The rapid progression of the pneumonia, the presence of multiple lung lesions, and the patient's immunocompromised state raise concern for invasive aspergillosis.\n",

      "{'query': \"An 83-year-old woman was admitted to the hos-\\npital because of asthma complicated by pneumonia\\nthat was unresponsive to antibiotic treatment.\\nThe patient had had asthma since childhood, com-\\nplicated by seven bouts of pneumonia by the age of\\n12 years and several episodes of pneumonia or bron-\\nchitis as an adult. There was a long history of hyper-\\ntension and a 10-year history of atrial fibrillation for\\nwhich she received no treatment. For two years she\\nhad had type 2 diabetes mellitus and unstable angina\\npectoris. She had never smoked and had no history\\nof tuberculosis, recent chest pain, chronic cough or\\nproduction of sputum, fever, symptoms of gastro-\\nesophageal reflux or aspiration, or recent travel. A\\nchest radiograph obtained elsewhere two months\\nbefore admission showed normal findings.\\nOne month before admission, the patient experi-\\nenced a worsening of long-standing exertional dysp-\\nnea, with the subsequent onset of coughing. Radio-\\ngraphs of the chest obtained at another hospital\\nshowed a few linear opacities in the left lower lung. A\\ncomputed tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax re-\\nvealed mild cylindrical bronchiectasis at both lung\\nbases. A cardiac ultrasonographic examination showed\\na left ventricular ejection fraction of 65 percent,\\nmild mitral and tricuspid insufficiency with biatrial\\nenlargement, and normal motion of the left ventric-\\nular wall. The glucose concentration ranged from\\n400 to 500 mg per deciliter (20 to 30 mmol per li-\\nter). Cultures of blood and urine specimens showed\\nno growth of organisms. Bronchodilator medica-\\ntions, methylprednisolone (40 mg given intrave-\\nnously three times a day), clindamycin, ciprofloxa-\\ncin, metronidazole, and warfarin were administered,\\nbut the cough and dyspnea persisted. On the 14th\\nhospital day, a radiograph of the chest showed\\npatchy, nodular consolidation in both lungs. The pa-\\ntient was transferred to this hospital.\\nThe temperature was 35.8°C, the pulse was 92,\\nand the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was\\n150/90 mm Hg.\\nExamination revealed a jugular venous pressure of\\n9 cm of water and bilateral diffuse pulmonary rhon-\\nchi with intermittent wheezes. The heart rhythm\\nwas irregular. There was an indwelling catheter.\\nThe urine was positive for protein (+) and glu-\\ncose (+++); the sediment contained 4 white cells\\nand innumerable red cells per high-power field. Lab-\\noratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). An\\nelectrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at a ven-\\ntricular rate of 121. A radiograph of the chest re-\\nvealed an increase in the bilateral nodular and patchy\\nconsolidations. Microscopical examination of a stained\\nspecimen of sputum showed no acid-fast bacilli. A\\nurine test for legionella antigen was negative.\\nSpecimens of blood, sputum, and urine were ob-\\ntained for culture. Clindamycin and warfarin were\\ncontinued, and diltiazem, digoxin, verapamil, furosem-\\nide, sucralfate, insulin, isosorbide, and glycopyrrolate\\nwere given, with prednisone administered at an ini-\\ntial dose of 60 mg daily and rapidly tapered. Oxy-\\ngen was administered by nasal prongs, with an oxy-\\ngen saturation of 95 percent. The temperature was\\nnormal on most occasions. The patient coughed up\\nyellow sputum for the first several days. Repeated\\nphysical examinations showed wheezing and bi-\\nlateral crackles that remained more prominent on\\nthe right side. The urine culture yielded abundant\\nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; two blood\\ncultures were sterile, and a sputum culture yielded\\nrespiratory tract flora and a few colonies of Asper-\\ngillus fumigatus. On the fourth hospital day, hema-\\ntologic laboratory tests were performed (Table 1).\\nA radiograph of the chest showed increased density\\nof the right basilar consolidations. On the following\\nday, a D-dimer test was positive (more than 8 µg per\\nmilliliter). Another radiograph of the chest (Fig. 1)\\nrevealed an increase in the bilateral consolidations.\\nA CT scan of the chest (Fig. 2) showed multifocal\\nconsolidations; some were poorly defined, but others\\nwere nodular. The largest nodule, 4 cm in diameter,\\nwas in the right upper lobe; precarinal, paratracheal,\\nand subcarinal lymph nodes were 1 to 2 cm in di-\\nameter. Evidence of bronchiectasis was obscured by\\nthe extensive consolidations. Warfarin was discon-\\ntinued, and vancomycin was added.\\nOn the sixth hospital day, laboratory tests were\\nperformed (Tables 1 and 2). A barium-swallow ex-\\namination showed no findings suggestive of aspira-\\ntion. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin,\\nand gentamicin were administered. That evening, ar-\\nterial-blood gases were measured (Table 3). A radio-\\ngraph of the chest showed an increase in the patchy\\nbilateral consolidations, which were more coalescent\\nin the right lung. The patient's breathing improved\\nafter an injection of furosemide.\\nOn the seventh hospital day, the cough persisted\\nbut produced little or no sputum. The urine was\\nnormal, except that the sediment contained 10 to 20\\nred cells and 4 white cells per high-power field. Lab-\\noratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2).\\nThree blood cultures remained sterile, and micro-\\nscopical examination of two specimens of sputum\\nshowed no acid-fast bacilli. Fiberoptic bronchoscop-\\nic examination showed mucosal edema with puru-\\nlent secretions in the right main bronchus. Further\\nexamination was curtailed because of respiratory in-\\nstability. Microscopical examination of a bronchoal-\\nveolar-lavage specimen from the right middle lobe\\nrevealed very few septate hyphae, moderate numbers\\nof neutrophils, a few yeast forms, and rare gram-\\npositive cocci in pairs. Examination of a lavage spec-\\nimen from the right lower lobe showed very rare\\nseptate hyphae, moderate numbers of neutrophils,\\nand a few yeast forms; rare gram-positive cocci in\\nclusters and very rare gram-positive cocci in chains\\nwere present. Wet-mount preparations of specimens\\nfrom both the middle and lower lobes showed bud-\\nding yeasts, pseudohyphae, and septate hyphae. No\\nacid-fast bacilli or Pneumocystis carinii microorgan-\\nisms were detected in a lavage specimen from the\\nright lower lobe. Cytologic examination showed no\\ntumor cells.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. RICHARD L. KRADIN*: We are faced with the\\nproblem of determining the cause of a rapidly pro-\\ngressing pneumonia in an elderly woman with asth-\\nma. She had been in good health before her admis-\\nsion to the hospital, except for asthma that began\\nduring childhood and the relatively recent onset of\\natrial fibrillation and type 2 diabetes mellitus.\\nMay we review the chest radiographs?\\nDR. ELIZABETH A. DRUCKER: A CT scan ob-\\ntained at the first hospital shows mild cylindrical\\nbronchiectasis at both lung bases. A chest radio-\\ngraph (Fig. 1), obtained two weeks later, reveals\\nnodular, patchy consolidation in both lungs. A tho-\\nracic CT scan (Fig. 2) shows asymmetric bilateral\\nconsolidation and multiple enlarged precarinal, para-\\ntracheal, and subcarinal lymph nodes. The consoli-\\ndation in the right lung became more confluent over\\nthe next several days, and diffuse air-space disease\\ndeveloped in the left lung.\\nDR. KRADIN: In formulating a diagnosis, I must\\nconsider the age of the patient, her underlying im-\\nmune status, and the distribution and course of the\\ndisease. The patient had a well-established history of\\nasthma dating back to childhood. In my opinion,\\nthere is little to suggest that her initial hospitaliza-\\ntion was precipitated by a disorder other than the\\nasthma, but we do not know whether the asthma\\nwas episodic or sustained. Furthermore, we do not\\nknow whether she had been taking corticosteroids\\non a long-term basis as an outpatient.\\nAsthma is defined physiologically as an episodic,\\nreversible disorder of bronchomotor tone. The caus-\\native factors are both allergic and nonimmune. Ato-\\npy, as evidenced by increased IgE levels and imme-\\ndiate hypersensitivity on skin testing, predominates\\nin childhood asthma; in contrast, nonallergic, or in-\\ntrinsic, asthma is associated with an older age and a\\ntendency toward intractable bronchospasm. This\\nwoman's childhood history of asthma suggests an al-\\nlergic basis, but the more recent history does not.\\nA variety of factors can trigger asthma: analgesics,\\ngastroesophageal reflux, severe dysphoria, environ-\\nmental pollutants, alcohol, and certain foods. Infec-\\ntions by viruses, including influenzavirus, rhinovirus,\\nand respiratory syncytial virus, have been implicated\\nin most exacerbations of asthma in childhood. How-\\never, evidence of antecedent viral infections is found\\nin only 10 percent of adults with acute exacerbations\\nof asthma.\\nViral infections can impair the already compro-\\nmised clearance of airway pathogens in patients with\\nasthma, conferring a predisposition to infections of\\nthe lower respiratory tract. Indeed, the bimodal\\ncourse of the disease in this patient an acute ep-\\nisode of asthma in the absence of parenchymal dis-\\nease followed days later by serious pneumonia\\nsuggests an infectious complication.\\nBefore considering the nature of this complica-\\ntion, I shall discuss other diseases that involve asth-\\nma with parenchymal infiltrates at presentation.\\nAsthma can accompany a variety of disorders associ-\\nated with pulmonary eosinophilia, including Löf-\\nfler's syndrome and other variants of eosinophilic\\npneumonia, as well as systemic vascular disorders,\\nincluding the Churg-Strauss syndrome and polyar-\\nteritis nodosa. These diagnoses are unlikely in this\\ncase, however, since the patient presented without\\nradiographic evidence of diffuse infiltrates or periph-\\neral eosinophilia.\\nThe rapid course of the disease and the negative\\nfindings on cytologic examination do not suggest\\nthe presence of a neoplasm, although certain pulmo-\\nnary infiltrative disorders, especially lymphoma and\\nsarcoidosis, can produce nodular radiographic infil-\\ntrates and wheezing if the pulmonary airways are di-\\nrectly involved.\\nPulmonary embolic disease must be considered in\\na hospitalized elderly woman with chronic atrial fi-\\nbrillation. In this case, there was a sporadic increase\\nin the plasma level of D-dimers, a finding consistent\\nwith the formation of intravascular clots and fibri-\\nnolysis. Pulmonary embolic disease may be associated\\nwith episodic bronchospasm and normal findings on\\nchest films. Air-space hemorrhage and pulmonary in-\\nfarction caused by chronic pulmonary emboli could\\nhave accounted for the development of bilateral in-\\nfiltrates. These processes are unlikely, however, in view\\nof the relatively normal blood oxygen values initially,\\nthe nodular appearance of the infiltrates, and the pro-\\ngression of the disease despite anticoagulation therapy.\\nThe most likely diagnosis is an infection. The\\nscanty sputum production and the failure to isolate\\nan infectious agent after multiple attempts argue\\nagainst the presence of common bacterial pathogens.\\nNodular pneumonia can result from infection with\\nmycobacteria or legionella, but these pathogens were\\nnot detected in this case. Infection with P. carinii\\ncan be associated with a variety of radiographic find-\\nings, but the bronchoalveolar-lavage specimens were\\nnegative for this organism.\\nThe presence of aspergillus species in a sputum\\nculture requires an explanation. Aspergillus is found\\nin water, soil, aerosols, and decaying organic matter.\\nA. fumigatus, A. niger, and A. flavus account for most\\ncases of clinical disease. Under conditions of high\\noxygen tension, which may occur in patients with as-\\npergillomas or aspergillus sinus infections, conidio-\\nphores, or fruiting bodies, may develop. They closely\\nresemble the Roman Catholic aspergillum (used to\\nsprinkle holy water), for which the fungus is named.\\nSince aspergillus species are widespread in the envi-\\nronment, growth on culture must always be inter-\\npreted in the context of the clinical presentation.\\nUnder most conditions, aspergillus hyphae are\\nseptate, with asymmetric dichotomous branching at\\n45-degree angles to the long axis of the organism.\\nAlthough this appearance is characteristic, it may be\\nimpossible to distinguish aspergillus morphological-\\nly from Pseudoallescheria boydii or the fusarium, al-\\nternaria, or Bipolarina fungal species. Fruiting bod-\\nies in tissue specimens, however, are diagnostic of\\naspergillus species.¹\\nThere are three major types of pulmonary patho-\\ngen-host interactions involving aspergillus organ-\\nisms2 (Table 4). The most clinically benign interac-\\ntion is saprophytic colonization of the pulmonary\\nairways, which may accompany chronic diseases of\\nthe airways associated with defective mucociliary\\nclearance, inspissation of mucus, and structural chang-\\nes in the bronchial wall. These diseases include asth-\\nma, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and cystic fi-\\nbrosis. Invasive aspergillosis does not develop in most\\npatients with these diseases, but immunosuppression\\nconfers a susceptibility to tissue invasion.\\nAspergillomas, or fungus balls, can form in areas\\nwhere pulmonary cysts have developed, most often\\nin healed tuberculous cavities or in the emphysema-\\ntous bullae or cystic lesions of sarcoidosis. In pa-\\ntients with this second type of pathogen-host inter-\\naction, an intracavitary nidus composed of fungus\\nand detritic lung tissue is identified radiologically\\nand may be seen to move within the cavity when the\\npatient changes position. Fruiting bodies may be de-\\ntected by histologic studies, with crystals of calcium\\noxalate identified between the mycelial layers. IgG\\nprecipitins to aspergillomas are detected in serum\\nsamples from 90 percent of patients with this type\\nof pathogen-host interaction. Most aspergillomas\\nare clinically silent, but some may result in cough\\nand hemoptysis, requiring surgical excision.\\nFinally, allergic responses to aspergillus may cause\\nclinical manifestations of pulmonary disease. Hyper-\\nsensitivity pneumonitis was first described in malt\\nworkers who had fever, leukocytosis, and pulmonary\\ninfiltrates within hours after exposure to the spores\\nof A. clavatus. As in most types of hypersensitivity\\npneumonitis, pathological examination of the lung\\nshows a lymphocytic and granulomatous alveolitis.\\nAsthma itself may be caused by an IgE-mediated\\nhypersensitivity response to aspergillus mold. This\\nform of asthma is an occupational hazard for some\\nfood preparers, particularly bakers who are susceptible\\nto asthma and who may be exposed to food addi-\\ntives in the form of enzymes produced by aspergillus\\norganisms. A related disorder, allergic bronchopul-\\nmonary aspergillosis, is characterized by asthma, the\\npresence of IgG precipitins to aspergillus, elevated\\nIgE levels, immediate reactivity to aspergillus on\\nskin testing, and central bronchiectasis, often with\\nmucoid impaction. Patients with preexisting asthma\\nor cystic fibrosis are at especially high risk for this\\ndisorder. Symptoms include wheezing, increased\\nsputum production with the expectoration of mu-\\ncous plugs laden with eosinophils, and occasionally,\\nfever, weight loss, and night sweats.\\nThe diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary as-\\npergillosis is confirmed on the basis of various clin-\\nical findings. Almost all patients have immediate re-\\nsponses to aspergillus extracts on skin testing. IgG\\nprecipitins are elevated, but this is not a specific find-\\ning, since IgG precipitins can be elevated in other\\nforms of pulmonary aspergillosis. Peripheral-blood\\neosinophilia is common. However, the most distinc-\\ntive feature of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillo-\\nsis is central bronchiectasis, with eosinophilic pneu-\\nmonia adjacent to areas of bronchiectasis with\\nmucoid impaction. Fragmented hyphal forms may\\nbe seen within the mucous plugs. Bronchocentric\\ngranulomatosis, a necrotizing granulomatous re-\\nsponse limited to the airway wall, or exudative bron-\\nchiolitis may be seen. Corticosteroids are the main-\\nstay of treatment, and there is little evidence that\\nfungicidal therapy is effective.\\nThe most malignant forms of aspergillus infection\\nare those that develop in persons with impaired im-\\nmunity and result in invasion and necrosis of pulmo-\\nnary tissue. A chronic necrotizing form of as-\\npergillosis that has been described appears to reflect\\na response intermediate in severity between that of\\nallergic aspergillosis and fulminant invasive disease.\\nPatients generally have an identifiable underlying\\nstructural deformity of the lung due to chronic air-\\nway disease, sarcoidosis, extensive interstitial fibrosis,\\nor aspergilloma, along with mild immunologic def-\\nicits due to diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid therapy,\\nalcoholism, or advanced age. Cavitary pneumonia\\npredominantly involving the upper lobe is the most\\ncommon presentation, and secondary aspergilloma\\nformation has been reported. Vascular spread of in-\\nfection is not a feature, however, and the disease lasts\\nfor months or years. Sputum cultures for aspergillus\\nmay be positive, but lung biopsy is required for a de-\\nfinitive diagnosis. Treatment includes systemic anti-\\nfungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine\\nor itraconazole. Surgical resection may be curative in\\ncases of limited disease.\\nI believe that the diagnosis in this case is invasive\\npulmonary aspergillosis. This feared form of infec-\\ntion is limited to the severely immunocompromised\\nhost who has marked neutropenia (less than 500 neu-\\ntrophils per cubic millimeter), neutrophil dysfunction\\ndue to chronic granulomatous disease, or iatrogenic\\nimmunosuppression due to treatment with cortico-\\nsteroids, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or broad-spectrum\\nantibiotics. The patient under discussion was probably\\nseverely immunosuppressed as a result of the combi-\\nnation of treatment with corticosteroids and broad-\\nspectrum antibiotics, hyperglycemia, and advanced\\nage. Invasive aspergillosis has also been documented,\\nhowever, in a patient with chronic obstructive pul-\\nmonary disease after a short intravenous course of\\ncorticosteroids.3 In two other patients with chronic\\nobstructive pulmonary disease, invasive aspergillosis\\ndeveloped after the air filters in their hospital rooms\\nhad been replaced.4 Inadequate filtration apparently\\nallowed an unusually high level of exposure to as-\\npergillus, a risk factor for invasive aspergillosis.\\nThe radiographic characteristics of invasive as-\\npergillosis generally reflect the underlying patho-\\nlogical features. The pulmonary disease is usually\\nmultifocal but may progress, as in this case, to con-\\nsolidate a segment or an entire lobe of the lung.\\nNodular disease, if present, suggests invasion of blood\\nvessels by the organism.5 Vascular invasion may pro-\\nduce radiographically detectable target lesions with\\ncentral necrosis of lung tissue and a characteristic\\nhemorrhagic rim. The lung may also undergo ische-\\nmic infarction due to thrombosis of medium-sized\\npulmonary arteries. Areas of necrotic lung are prone\\nto cavitation, which may promote further fungal\\ngrowth.\\nThe association of air-space disease with local ar-\\nterial thrombosis results in decreased ventilation and\\nperfusion in the same area of the lung. This combi-\\nnation probably accounts for the relatively small loss\\nof arterial oxygenation in this case, despite radio-\\ngraphic evidence of considerable lung involvement.\\nBlood-borne spread of organisms, which occurs in\\n25 to 33 percent of cases, is a very serious compli-\\ncation, because vital organs, including the brain,\\nheart, kidneys, and liver, are susceptible to hemor-\\nrhagic or embolic infarction and the development of\\nnew foci of infection. An unusual and noninfectious\\ncomplication is acute renal failure due to the depo-\\nsition of calcium oxalate crystals in renal tubules.\\nThe definitive diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis\\nrequires the identification of the fungi in lung tissue.\\nWhen the radiographic and clinical features suggest\\ninvasion, the repeated isolation of organisms from\\nsputum or bronchoalveolar-lavage specimens is\\nclosely correlated with biopsy confirmation of the\\ndiagnosis, but bronchoalveolar lavage yields organ-\\nisms in only about 50 percent of patients with the\\ndisease.7 The detection of circulating aspergillus an-\\ntigens may be a sensitive indicator of vascular inva-\\nsion. The elevated D-dimer level in this patient was\\nprobably related to intravascular thrombosis trig-\\ngered by the invading organisms. It would be inter-\\nesting to know whether elevated D-dimer levels\\ncommonly accompany invasive pulmonary infection.\\nAspergillus secretes a large number of factors,\\nsome of which may have a role in its virulence.\\nElastase and chymotrypsin-like proteinases can pro-\\nmote tissue invasion. Endotoxins, ribotoxins, and\\ngliotoxins also promote pathogenicity. Since innate\\ncellular immunity mediated by neutrophils and mac-\\nrophages is the main pathway of the host defense,\\nwhatever suppresses the activities of these cells, in-\\ncluding factors secreted by the organism itself, can\\ncontribute to tissue invasion.\\nAmphotericin B remains the mainstay of treat-\\nment for aspergillus infections, although flucytosine,\\nitraconazole, and terbinafine are also active against\\nthe organism. Surgery may be indicated for early lo-\\ncalized disease but is largely used to control the he-\\nmoptysis that can accompany vascular invasion and\\nlung infarction.\\nEither a video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy or an\\nopen-lung biopsy probably established the diagnosis\\nin this case. I believe that airway colonization, possi-\\nbly in a bronchiectatic segment of the right lower\\nlobe, combined with the patient's immunosuppressed\\ncondition, ultimately resulted in fungal air-space in-\\nfection that progressed to pulmonary vascular inva-\\nsion. With extensive pulmonary disease, metastatic\\nsites of infection are likely to develop, and such me-\\ntastases may have been a tertiary complication of this\\npatient's illness. I attribute the finding of pseudohy-\\nphae in the bronchoalveolar-lavage specimens to air-\\nway colonization by Candida albicans, but I cannot\\nrule out a concomitant candidal invasion.\\nUnfortunately, the rate of death from invasive pul-\\nmonary aspergillosis remains high despite aggressive\\nmedical therapy. In one study, the initiation of anti-\\nfungal treatment more than 10 days after the radio-\\ngraphic detection of disease was associated with a 90\\npercent mortality rate, 10 although earlier interven-\\ntions reduced the rate to 41 percent.\\nDR. ATUL MALHOTRA: The pulmonary consulta-\\ntion service favored the diagnosis of invasive pulmo-\\nnary aspergillosis, but our differential diagnosis also\\nincluded bronchocentric granulomatosis and chron-\\nic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis with bacterial\\nsuperinfection.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nInvasive pulmonary aspergillosis.\\nDR. RICHARD L. KRADIN'S DIAGNOSIS\\nInvasive pulmonary aspergillosis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: An exploratory right-sid-\\ned thoracotomy revealed many old pleural adhesions\\ncaused by previous bouts of pneumonia. A single\\nnodule in the superior segment of the right lower\\nlobe was aspirated for culture and then resected. The\\nnodule consisted of a cavity lined with necrotic tis-\\nsue, which was surrounded by dense inflammatory\\ntissue (Fig. 3). Necrotic tissue abutted an elastic pul-\\nmonary artery (Fig. 4). Inflammatory cells extended\\ninto the media and caused intimal hyperplasia, but\\nthe arterial wall remained intact. Necrotizing pneu-\\nmonia with an exudation of fibrin and neutrophils\\nwas present in some areas that were not adjacent to\\nthe nodule. Branching hyphae of aspergillus (Fig. 5)\\nwere present in the necrotic layer of the nodule and\\nin the nonadjacent areas of necrotizing pneumonia.\\nThe hyphae were highlighted by a silver stain (Fig.\\n6). Culture grew A. fumigatus. Some terminal bron-\\nchioles were plugged with mucus, necrotic histio-\\ncytes, and hyphae (Fig. 7), with erosion of epithelial\\nmetaplasia similar to that associated with broncho-\\ncentric granulomatosis. However, the palisading his-\\ntiocytes and eosinophils that are typical of that con-\\ndition were not present.\\nAfter the lung biopsy, antifungal therapy was ad-\\nministered, but the patient had increasing hyper-\\ntension and hypoxia. A bone marrow biopsy was\\nperformed to rule out leukemia and lymphoma. A\\nscanty bone marrow specimen revealed myeloid hy-\\nperplasia. Acute renal failure developed. The patient\\ndied on the 12th day in this hospital (the 26th day\\nof the combined hospitalization). Permission for an\\nautopsy was not obtained.\\nThis case is an example of a community-acquired\\npneumonia due to aspergillus.11 Invasive aspergillosis\\nis not common in immunocompetent patients but is\\nwell described.12-19 It can complicate viral pneu-\\nmonia in previously healthy persons. 20,21 The history\\nof asthma and recurrent pneumonia and the finding\\nof bronchiectasis are characteristic of various forms\\nof chronic intrabronchial aspergillosis, including bron-\\nchocentric granulomatosis, which can progress to a\\nchronic aspergillus pneumonia and even to tissue in-\\nvasion with cavitary necrosis. The clinicopathologi-\\ncal spectrum of aspergillus lung disease, including\\nthe chronic necrotizing forms, has been expanded\\nover the past three decades.22-27\\nThe severity of the conditions associated with\\nchronic necrotizing aspergillosis is generally inter-\\nmediate between those associated with the allergic\\nand the septic forms. These conditions include pul-\\nmonary aspergilloma with early invasion, bronchial\\ncolonization by aspergillus with early invasion, lobar\\npneumonia, aspergillosis with cavitary necrosis, and\\nsequestrum of lung in cavitary aspergillosis. 28,29 Al-\\nlergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis30 and aspergil-\\nloma31,32 can progress to invasive aspergillosis. This\\ncase is notable because of the presence of chronic\\nnecrotizing aspergillosis with cavitary necrosis and\\nelements of bronchocentric granulomatosis and in-\\nvasion. The terminal event was probably hematoge-\\nnous dissemination of the organism to the kidneys\\nand other viscera.\\nDR. DAVID R. SCHWARTZ: Can you distinguish\\nchronic necrotizing aspergillosis from invasive pul-\\nmonary aspergillosis on the basis of the pathological\\nchanges you have described?\\nDR. MARK: Invasive aspergillosis is generally asso-\\nciated with extensive invasion of blood vessels and\\nembolic spread, with little or no cellular or fibrous\\nreaction. In contrast, chronic necrotizing aspergillo-\\nsis is generally characterized by local penetration\\ninto tissue, but this process is contained by a cellular\\nor fibrous reaction.\\nDR. SCHWARTZ: Are there any prospective data\\non patients with saprophytic or hypersensitivity\\nforms of pulmonary aspergillosis in whom the infec-\\ntion progressed to the invasive form despite the ab-\\nsence of a clear-cut immunosuppressive status? Pre-\\nsumably such patients initially would have a greater\\nquantity of aspergillus in their lungs.\\nDR. KRADIN: I am not aware of any data of that\\ntype. Although this case is not an example of classic\\nimmunosuppression, retrospective analysis uncovers\\na constellation of findings that could have resulted\\nin substantial immunosuppression, particularly sup-\\npression of innate immunity. Phagocytosis by mac-\\nrophages and neutrophils is compromised by ad-\\nvanced age, marked hyperglycemia, a history of\\nasthma, underlying pulmonary disease, the use of\\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics, and the persistent pres-\\nence of the organism itself.33 All these factors prob-\\nably resulted in immunosuppression of a degree suf-\\nficient to permit the development of invasive\\ndisease.34 Do we know whether the patient had been\\ntaking corticosteroids for a long period as an outpa-\\ntient?\\nDR.

She had become increasingly forgetful and occasionally got lost in her own neighborhood. On the morning of her admission, she had called one of her daughters at work in an agitated and disoriented state, which resolved spontaneously. The patient's daughters reported that one week earlier she had had slightly slurred speech, dizziness, and right-sided facial droop for a day. She had also fallen on her right side two weeks earlier and reported having a bruise and some discomfort in her right shoulder. She had lost 50 lb (23 kg) in weight in the preceding six months and reported having a poor appetite, with early satiety. She had no chest pain, cough, fever, chills, or night sweats. She had no other medical problems, had an unremarkable family history, and was taking no medications. She was a widow, had been a homemaker, and had had seven healthy children. She lived alone and did not use tobacco or alcohol.\\n\\nThe patient appears to have multifocal neurologic symptoms together with a constitutional syndrome of anorexia and weight loss. Neurologically, a single lesion could not explain the diverse focal or psychiatric symptoms. Progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms in an elderly patient suggest a diagnosis of dementia. The differential diagnosis includes Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disorders, and we must also rule out a number of metabolic disorders, particularly in the case of a patient who has waxing and waning mental acuity. The patient may really have two unrelated diseases, one resulting in a slow deterioration of her cognitive faculties and the other causing a more acute deterioration. The transient nature of both the facial weakness and the dizziness suggests the possibility of transient ischemic attacks. Her weight loss and multifocal neurologic symptoms raise the possibility of a primary neoplasm with metastatic spread; systemic vasculitis; an infectious process, including viral illnesses such as herpes and cytomegalovirus infection; and a chronic granulomatous disease, such as tuberculosis.\\n\\nThe patient was not in acute distress. She was alert and oriented to person and time, but not to place, and her speech was fluent though cautious. Her blood pressure was 190/70 mm Hg. Her pulse was 68 and regular. The temperature was 38.1°C (100.6°F). The results of a cranial-nerve examination were unremarkable. The neck was supple, without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy. A smooth, firm, fixed mass that was slightly tender and measured 5 cm by 5 cm was palpable in the right supraclavicular fossa. There were no palpable breast masses or retractions and no axillary adenopathy. The lungs were clear. There was a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border without radiation. On examination of the abdomen, a firm, smooth, nontender 10-cm mass was palpable 5 cm below the left costal margin. The results of rectal examination were normal, with brown stool that was negative for occult blood. There was no peripheral edema or rash. Motor strength was 5/5 throughout, and there were no sensory deficits. The patient's reflexes were normal, and her gait was normal though unsteady. Romberg's sign was not present. There was no finger-to-nose ataxia. The patient could not name the president, and her short-term recall was somewhat impaired.\\n\\nThe results of the neurologic examination fail to confirm a history suggesting cranial-nerve involvement, but there is an obvious deterioration in cognitive facility. The mass in the supraclavicular fossa appears to be distinguishable from the thyroid and is described as separate from the clavicle. The differential diagnosis includes primary lymphoma, primary neuronal tumor such as a glomus tumor of the carotid body, neurofibroma, a primary cancer of the chest, thyroid carcinoma, or more likely, metastatic neoplasm. It is unclear whether the abdominal mass is an enlarged spleen; a mass in the stomach, colon, or kidney (possibly with a supraclavicular sentinel node); or even an ovarian mass. Metastatic spread to the brain, as well as paraneoplastic phenomena such as hypercalcemia, could lead to the multifocal neurologic symptoms described in this patient. However, the supraclavicular mass is described as somewhat tender, a finding more typical of an acute (possibly infectious) process than a slowly evolving neoplastic process. Patients with endocarditis can present with a murmur, a low-grade fever, multiple neurologic symptoms, and palpable (though pulsatile) mycotic aneurysms or multiple abscesses due to embolization, although endocarditis is unlikely in this patient in view of the multiple masses.\\n\\nThe white-cell count was 5400 per cubic millimeter with a normal differential count; the hemoglobin level was 8.4 g per deciliter; and the platelet count was normal. The mean corpuscular volume was 87.3 fl, with a red-cell-distribution width of 14.1 percent. Electrolyte, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and liver-enzyme levels were normal. The results of urinalysis were unremarkable. Electrocardiography showed a normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy, and T-wave inversions in leads V₁ through V4, with no pathologic Q waves. A chest x-ray film revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, a tortuous and calcified aorta, and nonspecific streaky changes in the lungs without focal infiltrate (Fig. 1). The trachea appeared slightly deviated to the left. Radiographs of the right clavicle showed no fractures or dislocations. Computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the head without contrast medium revealed moderate atrophy and bilateral lacunar infarctions within the basal ganglia. There was no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or a mass effect.\\n\\nThe absence of abnormal findings on the chest film appears largely to rule out an intrathoracic neoplasm. The CT scan of the head is suggestive of a cerebrovascular disorder, with multiple lacunar infarcts visible in the basal ganglia. Because contrast medium was not used, one cannot rule out the possibility of subtle inflammatory changes of the meninges or the brain stem. There is no obvious space-occupying metastatic lesion to explain the patient's neurologic symptoms. Multi-infarct dementia could explain much of the neuropsychiatric deterioration described in this patient.\\n\\nThe patient was admitted to the geriatrics service to be evaluated for a possible malignant condition. She was afebrile but reported a steady, bitemporal headache. Analysis of cardiac-enzyme levels ruled out myocardial infarction. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen, obtained to evaluate the supraclavicular and abdominal masses, showed multiple irregularly walled lesions in the right supraclavicular fossa (Fig. 2), small bilateral pleural effusions, sigmoid diverticula, and a 13.5-cm cyst arising from the left kidney, which had a slightly thickened wall. On day 2 of hospitalization, fine-needle aspiration of the supraclavicular mass revealed lymphoid tissue with infarctive necrosis. Gram's stain and stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungi were negative, and blood and tissue were cultured.\\n\\nAt this point we are presented with a CT scan showing an irregularly walled lesion in the right supraclavicular fossa and a large cyst arising from the left kidney. Hypernephromas can have a cyst-like quality; however, this presentation is rare. The radiographic appearance of the lesion in the supraclavicular fossa is surprising. It was described not as a single mass but as an irregularly walled lesion, which is less typical of neoplasm. Aspiration of the mass confirmed the radiographic findings of necrotic lymph nodes, which supports an infectious cause. Granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis are very high on my diagnostic list. It is common to find no evidence of acid-fast bacilli on initial smears. Lymphoma cannot be ruled out, both because of the possibility of a sampling bias with biopsy and because lymphoid necrosis is also associated with lymphoma.\\n\\nThe biopsy tissue was sent for immunologic-marker studies. A urology consultant reviewed the CT scan and thought that the renal cyst was benign. The patient's headache persisted and was described as bitemporal, dull, and constant. One of the blood cultures obtained at admission grew clusters of gram-positive cocci. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 95 mm per hour. The patient remained afebrile, with a normal white-cell count, and her hemoglobin level was stable (8.0 g per deciliter).\\n\\nThe patient did have a persistent headache. Patients with Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis can present with weight loss, low-grade fevers, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and multiple abscesses. However, if the organism is in fact S. aureus, it is more likely to cause acute rather than subacute endocarditis. One would have expected to find gram-positive cocci in the lymph-node aspirate, as well as embolic findings on the CT scan of the head. The CT scanning did not include contrast medium, so small emboli, which would be enhanced by contrast medium, could have been missed.\\n\\nTransthoracic echocardiography performed to investigate the possibility of endocarditis showed that the size and function of the right and left ventricles were normal, that mild aortic regurgitation was present, and that there was no evidence of valvular vegetation. The gram-positive cocci were identified as S. epidermidis and judged to be a contaminant. Since the patient's headache persisted, a diagnosis of temporal arteritis was considered, and a temporal-artery biopsy performed on day 4 of hospitalization revealed atherosclerotic disease. The patient was evaluated simultaneously for anemia and dementia. An automated reticulocyte count was 1.8 percent. The results of iron studies were normal. Laboratory studies revealed the following values: red-cell folate, 267 ng per milliliter (605 nmol per liter); vitamin B12, 185 pg per milliliter (136 pmol per liter; normal, 157 to 1059 pg per milliliter [116 to 781 pmol per liter]); and thyrotropin, 2.1 IU per milliliter. A rapid plasma reagin test was negative.\\n\\nAlthough the absence of valvular lesions on a transthoracic echocardiogram does not rule out the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis, the gram-positive cocci obtained from the blood are identified as being S. epidermidis and most likely a contaminant. It is not clear to me why a temporal-artery biopsy was performed, since systemic vasculitis seems unlikely. The results of other laboratory tests are essentially unrevealing. At this point I believe we can narrow our diagnostic consideration substantially and that the correct diagnosis will be made from the lymph-node aspirate.\\n\\nAfter the fine-needle biopsy, the mass in the right supraclavicular fossa became hot, red, and more tender. Treatment with cefazolin was started for a suspected wound infection. The immunologic-marker studies of the biopsy specimen revealed predominantly T cells with a normal phenotype. Blood was obtained for measurement of serum methylmalonic acid, and vitamin B12 supplementation was initiated. A skin test for tuberculosis with purified protein derivative (PPD), which had been performed on day 3 of hospitalization, showed 23 mm of induration and an erythematous reaction 48 hours later.\\n\\nWe are told that the nature of the mass in the right supraclavicular fossa has changed, demonstrating an acute inflammatory process with rubor, calor, and dolor. We cannot be certain whether this is a progression of the primary underlying process or an iatrogenic complication of the biopsy. The positive PPD skin test is important. We know nothing of this patient's remote medical history and have no information about exposure to tuberculosis. This information would be important in attempting to determine whether the results indicate a recent or a chronic infection. With age, the reaction to PPD typically wanes. This patient had a robust response, suggesting active infection. Her physicians are now faced with a choice of empirical therapy for what I believe is the obvious diagnosis of tuberculosis or further evaluation of the mass with an excisional biopsy. The use of multiple drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis in the elderly is not without hazard, but I believe that we should not wait six weeks for the results of cultures and that either empirical antituberculosis therapy should be initiated or more tissue should be obtained to rule out the less likely possibility of a neoplasm.\\n\\nThe results of serum plasma electrophoresis were normal, and a test for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative. Since lymphoma was still a diagnostic possibility and the anemia remained unexplained, a bone marrow biopsy was performed on day 8. It revealed a hypercellular marrow with an increase in all elements, increased megakaryocytes with occasional atypical forms, increased iron stores, and a single lymphoid aggregate with a non-caseating epithelioid granuloma. Stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungi were negative.\\n\\nThe bone marrow evaluation is of some help, in that the results do not support a diagnosis of lymphoma. Though smears for acid-fast bacilli are negative, they are of low sensitivity and are not required for the diagnosis of acute tuberculosis. The fact that the granuloma is noncaseating does not dissuade me from a diagnosis of primary mycobacterial infection. I am more confident than ever that this patient has miliary tuberculosis, because of the bone marrow involvement, the lymphadenitis, and her positive PPD skin test. However, I cannot absolutely rule out the presence of an underlying lymphoma with the possibility of a reactivation of tuberculosis. Most lymphomas are associated with anergy, however, and I would have expected the patient to have a negative PPD skin test.\\n\\nThe patient remained afebrile and underwent an excisional biopsy of the supraclavicular mass on the 13th day of hospitalization. The mass was described as grossly necrotic with infiltrating lymphatic tissue. Histopathological analysis revealed granulomatous inflammation with necrosis (Fig. 3). There was no evidence of lymphoma. Stains for fungi were negative, and a stain for acid-fast bacilli demonstrated rare acid-fast bacilli. The serum methylmalonic acid level was 920 nmol per liter (normal range, 73 to 271). On the 15th day of hospitalization, treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, levofloxacin, and ethambutol was begun, with pyridoxine and vitamin B12 supplementation, and the patient was sent home. Cultures of the excisional biopsy specimen grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the cultures of the fine-needle-biopsy specimen also eventually grew the same organism. In the three months since the patient's discharge, her appetite, weight, and anemia have improved. She continues to have occasional periods of confusion, and one of her daughters is considering moving in with her.\\n\\nCOMMENTARY\\nThis patient presented with weight loss, lymphadenopathy, a change in mental status, and a large abdominal mass. The immediate assumption was that she had a malignant neoplasm with an underlying dementia. This case report demonstrates the importance of not jumping to conclusions. The abdominal mass turned out to be an incidental cyst, and most of her other medical problems were explained by a diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis. Since atypical presentations are the rule in elderly patients, the assumption of the presence of neoplasia not only was incorrect but also precipitated an extensive and largely unnecessary diagnostic evaluation in pursuit of a possible malignant condition, as well as a two-week delay in the initiation of antituberculosis therapy.\\nFrom medical school on, physicians are trained to seek a unifying diagnosis that can explain all or most aspects of a patient's illness at presentation. In geriatrics, this quest is often elusive. Elderly patients commonly have anywhere from three to six major coexisting conditions. In contrast to younger patients, who often have signs and symptoms referable to the diseased organ system, in the elderly, the final common pathway for the presentation of illness is typically a decreased ability to perform the activities of daily living, or the development of nonspecific symptoms, such as lethargy, confusion, falls, and incontinence. A change in mental status, for example, can be a manifestation of systemic inflammation or the result of a primary neurologic problem, a drug reaction, or any number of conditions, separately or in combination.\\nCommon atypical presentations in elderly patients include painless myocardial infarction, apathetic hyperthyroidism, depression masquerading as pseudodementia, and pneumonia without cough. The spectrum of clinical disease in elderly patients with tuberculosis is especially broad. Although some elderly patients present with productive cough, fever, and night sweats and have a positive PPD skin test or abnormal findings on a chest film (or both), these findings are much more common in younger patients with tuberculosis. As in the patient under discussion, elderly patients with either pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis often present with a change in mental status, gradual debilitation, and nonspecific symptoms.\\nAlthough the PPD skin test is still recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for all age groups, its value in elderly patients remains a subject of debate. Because many elderly patients have latent tuberculosis, a positive test may not be an indicator of current active disease, though a strongly positive result can be of some value, as it was in this patient. A negative PPD skin test certainly does not rule out tuberculosis, since advancing age may be accompanied by declining delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Studies of nursing home residents in Arkansas, for example, reveal that only about 20 to 35 percent of 60-year-old patients and only 5 to 10 percent of 90-year-olds have a positive reaction to tuberculin tests despite repeated booster testing in a population postulated to have a nearly 90 percent rate of previous exposure to the disease.\\nTuberculosis reemerged as an important pathogen in the 1980s and 1990s, largely as the result of the growing HIV epidemic. At least 50 percent of the excess cases of tuberculosis in the United States from 1985 through 1992 have been attributed to infection with HIV. In the developed world, however, the elderly may actually represent the largest repository of both potential and clinical cases of tuberculosis, and tuberculosis case rates appear to rise with every decade beyond the age of 70.\\nMost cases of tuberculosis in the elderly are thought to be due to a reactivation of the disease, with initial exposure having occurred 50 to 70 years earlier, when the disease was more common. Risk factors for the reactivation of tuberculosis include advanced age, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, gastrectomy, hematologic cancers and other malignant conditions, and waning immunity of diverse causes. Data also implicate tuberculosis as a nosocomial infection in nursing homes, with substantial increases in reactivity to tuberculin skin testing and active disease with prolonged residency in these homes.\\nThe response to the treatment of tuberculosis in the elderly also differs considerably from that in younger patients. As compared with patients under the age of 65, elderly patients are more likely to have adverse reactions to antituberculosis medications and drug-resistant disease, have higher tuberculosis-associated mortality, and are more than 20 times as likely to have the diagnosis made at autopsy.\\nInterestingly, the prevalence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in the United States remained nearly constant from the 1960s to the early 1980s, despite the decline in the total number of cases during that period. The increased incidence of tuberculosis in the mid-1980s was accompanied by a substantial increase in the proportion of cases described as extrapulmonary, from 7.8 percent of all cases in 1964 to 22 percent of all reported cases in 1992. The patient under discussion presented with extrapulmonary tuberculosis in the form of superficial tuberculous lymphadenitis, or scrofula. Twenty to 25 percent of patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis due to M. tuberculosis have lymphadenitis.\\nSome years ago, data suggested that the use of any diagnostic procedure other than complete excisional biopsy of the involved node predisposed patients to development of chronic fistulous tracts. Indeed, this patient appeared to have had at least a cellulitic superinfection of the area after the initial fine-needle aspiration. A study comparing fine-needle aspiration with surgical excision as the gold standard found that aspiration had an overall sensitivity (on the basis of histologic, smear, and culture results) of 62 percent (the sensitivity approaches 100 percent in HIV-positive patients). On the basis of these data, an approach to the diagnostic evaluation of tuberculous lymphadenitis was proposed. In the presence of a cervical mass and a positive PPD skin test, the initial evaluation should include fine-needle aspiration followed by empirical antituberculosis therapy until the culture results become available. Excisional biopsy should be reserved for patients with no response to therapy, negative culture results, or both. The use of this approach would have led to the correct diagnosis and more timely treatment of the patient under discussion, but it was not used by her physicians because they had jumped to the wrong conclusion of neoplasm. The discussant was more certain of the diagnosis and would have elected to initiate therapy immediately after the positive PPD skin test (the 5th day of hospitalization), rather than waiting for the results of either smears for acid-fast bacilli (available on the 13th day) or cultures, as the treating physicians chose to do.\\nJumping to the wrong conclusion, also referred to as premature closure, is one of many errors in diagnostic reasoning. Others include errors of omission and incorrect and inadequate synthesis of information. Premature closure occurs when clinicians fail to verify their initial hypothesis and yet fail to reject it. Thus, the diagnosis is not adequately justified by the available data. Interestingly, of all the types of errors, premature closure appears to be the only one that occurs regardless of a clinician's training and level of ability. It is a particularly dangerous error to make in that it may lead to delayed or incorrect treatment.\\nIn summary, this case demonstrates the importance of an awareness of the prevalence of tuberculosis in the elderly and of the altered presentation of disease and the frequency of multiple coexisting conditions in this age group. Tuberculosis is a disease known to have an atypical presentation, and even its typical presentation is altered in elderly patients. The patient under discussion presented only with anorexia, weight loss, and confusion. The physicians caring for her uncovered what they thought were physical signs of a malignant condition and attempted to confirm that diagnosis. Extensive evaluation preceded the diagnosis of tuberculosis, and although some of the additional medical problems that were identified may have contributed to the clinical manifestations, appropriate therapy was delayed because of an error in diagnostic reasoning. The nonspecific presentation of tuberculosis in an elderly patient led to an early misjudgment and biased subsequent interpretation of information and resulted in a lengthy hospitalization, unnecessary testing, and a delay in appropriate therapy.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "DISEASE_NAME: Tuberculosis\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Information Gathering:** The patient is an elderly woman with a history of weight loss, anorexia, and a new, tender supraclavicular mass. She also has a history of a large abdominal mass, which was later found to be a cyst. The patient's mental status has deteriorated over time, and she has a positive PPD skin test. The initial CT scan showed multiple irregularly walled lesions in the supraclavicular fossa and a renal cyst. The fine-needle aspiration of the supraclavicular mass revealed necrotic lymph nodes. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are highly suggestive of tuberculosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Systemic Infection:** Given the multiple lesions, weight loss, and positive PPD, a systemic infection is highly likely. Tuberculosis is a strong consideration.\n",
      "    *   **Lymphadenopathy:** The supraclavicular mass is a common site for lymph node involvement in tuberculosis.\n",
      "    *   **Renal Cyst:** The renal cyst could be related to the underlying tuberculosis or a separate finding.\n",
      "    *   **Neurological Symptoms:** The patient's mental status changes could be due to the systemic infection, metabolic derangements, or a separate neurological condition.\n",
      "    *   **Other possibilities:** Given the patient's age and the presence of multiple lesions, other possibilities include metastatic cancer, lymphoma, or other granulomatous diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Definitive Tests:** The definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis requires identification of the organism in tissue. The fine-needle aspiration and excisional biopsy of the supraclavicular mass were performed to obtain tissue for culture and histopathology. The cultures grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis, confirming the diagnosis.\n",
      "    *   **Discriminatory Features:** The presence of multiple lesions, a positive PPD skin test, and the characteristic appearance of the supraclavicular mass are all highly suggestive of tuberculosis. The negative cultures from the initial fine-needle aspiration may have been due to the low bacterial load or the technique used.\n",
      "    *   **Potential Biases:** The initial focus on a malignant neoplasm may have led to a delay in the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The patient's age and the presence of multiple lesions may have made clinicians more likely to consider a malignancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   The patient's presentation is consistent with miliary tuberculosis, a disseminated form of the disease. The positive PPD skin test, the presence of multiple lesions on imaging, and the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the biopsy specimens all support this diagnosis. The patient's mental status changes are likely due to the systemic effects of the infection.\n",
      "    *   The initial focus on a malignant neoplasm may have delayed the diagnosis of tuberculosis.\n",
      "    *   The patient is not acutely ill, but she has a chronic, progressive illness.\n",
      "    *   Initial supportive care should include treatment with anti-tuberculosis medications (isoniazid, rifampin, levofloxacin, and ethambutol) and pyridoxine and vitamin B12 supplementation.\n",
      "    *   Warning signs to monitor include worsening mental status, fever, and signs of organ dysfunction.\n",

      "{'query': \"An 82-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department by her daughters because of deterioration in her mental capabilities over a period of three months. She had become increasingly forgetful and occasionally got lost in her own neighborhood. On the morning of her admission, she had called one of her daughters at work in an agitated and disoriented state, which resolved spontaneously. The patient's daughters reported that one week earlier she had had slightly slurred speech, dizziness, and right-sided facial droop for a day. She had also fallen on her right side two weeks earlier and reported having a bruise and some discomfort in her right shoulder. She had lost 50 lb (23 kg) in weight in the preceding six months and reported having a poor appetite, with early satiety. She had no chest pain, cough, fever, chills, or night sweats. She had no other medical problems, had an unremarkable family history, and was taking no medications. She was a widow, had been a homemaker, and had had seven healthy children. She lived alone and did not use tobacco or alcohol.\\n\\nThe patient appears to have multifocal neurologic symptoms together with a constitutional syndrome of anorexia and weight loss. Neurologically, a single lesion could not explain the diverse focal or psychiatric symptoms. Progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms in an elderly patient suggest a diagnosis of dementia. The differential diagnosis includes Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disorders, and we must also rule out a number of metabolic disorders, particularly in the case of a patient who has waxing and waning mental acuity. The patient may really have two unrelated diseases, one resulting in a slow deterioration of her cognitive faculties and the other causing a more acute deterioration. The transient nature of both the facial weakness and the dizziness suggests the possibility of transient ischemic attacks. Her weight loss and multifocal neurologic symptoms raise the possibility of a primary neoplasm with metastatic spread; systemic vasculitis; an infectious process, including viral illnesses such as herpes and cytomegalovirus infection; and a chronic granulomatous disease, such as tuberculosis.\\n\\nThe patient was not in acute distress. She was alert and oriented to person and time, but not to place, and her speech was fluent though cautious. Her blood pressure was 190/70 mm Hg. Her pulse was 68 and regular. The temperature was 38.1°C (100.6°F). The results of a cranial-nerve examination were unremarkable. The neck was supple, without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy. A smooth, firm, fixed mass that was slightly tender and measured 5 cm by 5 cm was palpable in the right supraclavicular fossa. There were no palpable breast masses or retractions and no axillary adenopathy. The lungs were clear. There was a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border without radiation. On examination of the abdomen, a firm, smooth, nontender 10-cm mass was palpable 5 cm below the left costal margin. The results of rectal examination were normal, with brown stool that was negative for occult blood. There was no peripheral edema or rash. Motor strength was 5/5 throughout, and there were no sensory deficits. The patient's reflexes were normal, and her gait was normal though unsteady. Romberg's sign was not present. There was no finger-to-nose ataxia. The patient could not name the president, and her short-term recall was somewhat impaired.\\n\\nThe results of the neurologic examination fail to confirm a history suggesting cranial-nerve involvement, but there is an obvious deterioration in cognitive facility. The mass in the supraclavicular fossa appears to be distinguishable from the thyroid and is described as separate from the clavicle. The differential diagnosis includes primary lymphoma, primary neuronal tumor such as a glomus tumor of the carotid body, neurofibroma, a primary cancer of the chest, thyroid carcinoma, or more likely, metastatic neoplasm. It is unclear whether the abdominal mass is an enlarged spleen; a mass in the stomach, colon, or kidney (possibly with a supraclavicular sentinel node); or even an ovarian mass. Metastatic spread to the brain, as well as paraneoplastic phenomena such as hypercalcemia, could lead to the multifocal neurologic symptoms described in this patient. However, the supraclavicular mass is described as somewhat tender, a finding more typical of an acute (possibly infectious) process than a slowly evolving neoplastic process. Patients with endocarditis can present with a murmur, a low-grade fever, multiple neurologic symptoms, and palpable (though pulsatile) mycotic aneurysms or multiple abscesses due to embolization, although endocarditis is unlikely in this patient in view of the multiple masses.\\n\\nThe white-cell count was 5400 per cubic millimeter with a normal differential count; the hemoglobin level was 8.4 g per deciliter; and the platelet count was normal. The mean corpuscular volume was 87.3 fl, with a red-cell-distribution width of 14.1 percent. Electrolyte, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and liver-enzyme levels were normal. The results of urinalysis were unremarkable. Electrocardiography showed a normal sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy, and T-wave inversions in leads V₁ through V4, with no pathologic Q waves. A chest x-ray film revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, a tortuous and calcified aorta, and nonspecific streaky changes in the lungs without focal infiltrate (Fig. 1). The trachea appeared slightly deviated to the left. Radiographs of the right clavicle showed no fractures or dislocations. Computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the head without contrast medium revealed moderate atrophy and bilateral lacunar infarctions within the basal ganglia. There was no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or a mass effect.\\n\\nThe absence of abnormal findings on the chest film appears largely to rule out an intrathoracic neoplasm. The CT scan of the head is suggestive of a cerebrovascular disorder, with multiple lacunar infarcts visible in the basal ganglia. Because contrast medium was not used, one cannot rule out the possibility of subtle inflammatory changes of the meninges or the brain stem. There is no obvious space-occupying metastatic lesion to explain the patient's neurologic symptoms. Multi-infarct dementia could explain much of the neuropsychiatric deterioration described in this patient.\\n\\nThe patient was admitted to the geriatrics service to be evaluated for a possible malignant condition. She was afebrile but reported a steady, bitemporal headache. Analysis of cardiac-enzyme levels ruled out myocardial infarction. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen, obtained to evaluate the supraclavicular and abdominal masses, showed multiple irregularly walled lesions in the right supraclavicular fossa (Fig. 2), small bilateral pleural effusions, sigmoid diverticula, and a 13.5-cm cyst arising from the left kidney, which had a slightly thickened wall. On day 2 of hospitalization, fine-needle aspiration of the supraclavicular mass revealed lymphoid tissue with infarctive necrosis.

She continues to have occasional periods of confusion, and one of her daughters is considering moving in with her.\\n\\nCOMMENTARY\\nThis patient presented with weight loss, lymphadenopathy, a change in mental status, and a large abdominal mass. The immediate assumption was that she had a malignant neoplasm with an underlying dementia. This case report demonstrates the importance of not jumping to conclusions. The abdominal mass turned out to be an incidental cyst, and most of her other medical problems were explained by a diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis. Since atypical presentations are the rule in elderly patients, the assumption of the presence of neoplasia not only was incorrect but also precipitated an extensive and largely unnecessary diagnostic evaluation in pursuit of a possible malignant condition, as well as a two-week delay in the initiation of antituberculosis therapy.\\nFrom medical school on, physicians are trained to seek a unifying diagnosis that can explain all or most aspects of a patient's illness at presentation. In geriatrics, this quest is often elusive. Elderly patients commonly have anywhere from three to six major coexisting conditions. In contrast to younger patients, who often have signs and symptoms referable to the diseased organ system, in the elderly, the final common pathway for the presentation of illness is typically a decreased ability to perform the activities of daily living, or the development of nonspecific symptoms, such as lethargy, confusion, falls, and incontinence. A change in mental status, for example, can be a manifestation of systemic inflammation or the result of a primary neurologic problem, a drug reaction, or any number of conditions, separately or in combination.\\nCommon atypical presentations in elderly patients include painless myocardial infarction, apathetic hyperthyroidism, depression masquerading as pseudodementia, and pneumonia without cough. The spectrum of clinical disease in elderly patients with tuberculosis is especially broad. Although some elderly patients present with productive cough, fever, and night sweats and have a positive PPD skin test or abnormal findings on a chest film (or both), these findings are much more common in younger patients with tuberculosis. As in the patient under discussion, elderly patients with either pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis often present with a change in mental status, gradual debilitation, and nonspecific symptoms.\\nAlthough the PPD skin test is still recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for all age groups, its value in elderly patients remains a subject of debate. Because many elderly patients have latent tuberculosis, a positive test may not be an indicator of current active disease, though a strongly positive result can be of some value, as it was in this patient. A negative PPD skin test certainly does not rule out tuberculosis, since advancing age may be accompanied by declining delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Studies of nursing home residents in Arkansas, for example, reveal that only about 20 to 35 percent of 60-year-old patients and only 5 to 10 percent of 90-year-olds have a positive reaction to tuberculin tests despite repeated booster testing in a population postulated to have a nearly 90 percent rate of previous exposure to the disease.\\nTuberculosis reemerged as an important pathogen in the 1980s and 1990s, largely as the result of the growing HIV epidemic. At least 50 percent of the excess cases of tuberculosis in the United States from 1985 through 1992 have been attributed to infection with HIV. In the developed world, however, the elderly may actually represent the largest repository of both potential and clinical cases of tuberculosis, and tuberculosis case rates appear to rise with every decade beyond the age of 70.\\nMost cases of tuberculosis in the elderly are thought to be due to a reactivation of the disease, with initial exposure having occurred 50 to 70 years earlier, when the disease was more common. Risk factors for the reactivation of tuberculosis include advanced age, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, gastrectomy, hematologic cancers and other malignant conditions, and waning immunity of diverse causes. Data also implicate tuberculosis as a nosocomial infection in nursing homes, with substantial increases in reactivity to tuberculin skin testing and active disease with prolonged residency in these homes.\\nThe response to the treatment of tuberculosis in the elderly also differs considerably from that in younger patients. As compared with patients under the age of 65, elderly patients are more likely to have adverse reactions to antituberculosis medications and drug-resistant disease, have higher tuberculosis-associated mortality, and are more than 20 times as likely to have the diagnosis made at autopsy.\\nInterestingly, the prevalence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in the United States remained nearly constant from the 1960s to the early 1980s, despite the decline in the total number of cases during that period. The increased incidence of tuberculosis in the mid-1980s was accompanied by a substantial increase in the proportion of cases described as extrapulmonary, from 7.8 percent of all cases in 1964 to 22 percent of all reported cases in 1992. The patient under discussion presented with extrapulmonary tuberculosis in the form of superficial tuberculous lymphadenitis, or scrofula. Twenty to 25 percent of patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis due to M. tuberculosis have lymphadenitis.\\nSome years ago, data suggested that the use of any diagnostic procedure other than complete excisional biopsy of the involved node predisposed patients to development of chronic fistulous tracts. Indeed, this patient appeared to have had at least a cellulitic superinfection of the area after the initial fine-needle aspiration. A study comparing fine-needle aspiration with surgical excision as the gold standard found that aspiration had an overall sensitivity (on the basis of histologic, smear, and culture results) of 62 percent (the sensitivity approaches 100 percent in HIV-positive patients). On the basis of these data, an approach to the diagnostic evaluation of tuberculous lymphadenitis was proposed. In the presence of a cervical mass and a positive PPD skin test, the initial evaluation should include fine-needle aspiration followed by empirical antituberculosis therapy until the culture results become available. Excisional biopsy should be reserved for patients with no response to therapy, negative culture results, or both. The use of this approach would have led to the correct diagnosis and more timely treatment of the patient under discussion, but it was not used by her physicians because they had jumped to the wrong conclusion of neoplasm. The discussant was more certain of the diagnosis and would have elected to initiate therapy immediately after the positive PPD skin test (the 5th day of hospitalization), rather than waiting for the results of either smears for acid-fast bacilli (available on the 13th day) or cultures, as the treating physicians chose to do.\\nJumping to the wrong conclusion, also referred to as premature closure, is one of many errors in diagnostic reasoning. Others include errors of omission and incorrect and inadequate synthesis of information. Premature closure occurs when clinicians fail to verify their initial hypothesis and yet fail to reject it. Thus, the diagnosis is not adequately justified by the available data. Interestingly, of all the types of errors, premature closure appears to be the only one that occurs regardless of a clinician's training and level of ability. It is a particularly dangerous error to make in that it may lead to delayed or incorrect treatment.\\nIn summary, this case demonstrates the importance of an awareness of the prevalence of tuberculosis in the elderly and of the altered presentation of disease and the frequency of multiple coexisting conditions in this age group. Tuberculosis is a disease known to have an atypical presentation, and even its typical presentation is altered in elderly patients. The patient under discussion presented only with anorexia, weight loss, and confusion. The physicians caring for her uncovered what they thought were physical signs of a malignant condition and attempted to confirm that diagnosis. Extensive evaluation preceded the diagnosis of tuberculosis, and although some of the additional medical problems that were identified may have contributed to the clinical manifestations, appropriate therapy was delayed because of an error in diagnostic reasoning. The nonspecific presentation of tuberculosis in an elderly patient led to an early misjudgment and biased subsequent interpretation of information and resulted in a lengthy hospitalization, unnecessary testing, and a delay in appropriate therapy.\", 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"WORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Miliary Tuberculosis, Stage I (active, but not acutely ill)\\nDISEASE_NAME: Tuberculosis\\n\\nReasoning:\\n\\n1.  **Information Gathering:** The patient is an elderly woman with a history of weight loss, anorexia, and a new, tender supraclavicular mass. She also has a history of a large abdominal mass, which was later found to be a cyst. The patient's mental status has deteriorated over time, and she has a positive PPD skin test. The initial CT scan showed multiple irregularly walled lesions in the supraclavicular fossa and a renal cyst. The fine-needle aspiration of the supraclavicular mass revealed necrotic lymph nodes. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are highly suggestive of tuberculosis.\\n\\n2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\\n\\n    *   **Systemic Infection:** Given the multiple lesions, weight loss, and positive PPD, a systemic infection is highly likely. Tuberculosis is a strong consideration.\\n    *   **Lymphadenopathy:** The supraclavicular mass is a common site for lymph node involvement in tuberculosis.\\n    *   **Renal Cyst:** The renal cyst could be related to the underlying tuberculosis or a separate finding.\\n    *   **Neurological Symptoms:** The patient's mental status changes could be due to the systemic infection, metabolic derangements, or a separate neurological condition.\\n    *   **Other possibilities:** Given the patient's age and the presence of multiple lesions, other possibilities include metastatic cancer, lymphoma, or other granulomatous diseases.\\n\\n3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\\n\\n    *   **Definitive Tests:** The definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis requires identification of the organism in tissue. The fine-needle aspiration and excisional biopsy of the supraclavicular mass were performed to obtain tissue for culture and histopathology. The cultures grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis, confirming the diagnosis.\\n    *   **Discriminatory Features:** The presence of multiple lesions, a positive PPD skin test, and the characteristic appearance of the supraclavicular mass are all highly suggestive of tuberculosis. The negative cultures from the initial fine-needle aspiration may have been due to the low bacterial load or the technique used.\\n    *   **Potential Biases:** The initial focus on a malignant neoplasm may have led to a delay in the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The patient's age and the presence of multiple lesions may have made clinicians more likely to consider a malignancy.\\n\\n4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:**\\n\\n    *   The patient's presentation is consistent with miliary tuberculosis, a disseminated form of the disease. The positive PPD skin test, the presence of multiple lesions on imaging, and the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the biopsy specimens all support this diagnosis. The patient's mental status changes are likely due to the systemic effects of the infection.\\n    *   The initial focus on a malignant neoplasm may have delayed the diagnosis of tuberculosis.\\n    *   The patient is not acutely ill, but she has a chronic, progressive illness.\\n    *   Initial supportive care should include treatment with anti-tuberculosis medications (isoniazid, rifampin, levofloxacin, and ethambutol) and pyridoxine and vitamin B12 supplementation.\\n    *   Warning signs to monitor include worsening mental status, fever, and signs of organ dysfunction.\\n\\nWORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Miliary Tuberculosis, Stage I\\nDISEASE_NAME: Tuberculosis\\n\", 'original_file': 'NEJM199811053391908.json'}\n",

EBELING, Assistant Editor\\n\\nCase 34-1998\\n\\nPRESENTATION OF CASE\\nA 71-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital\\nbecause of fever, dyspnea, and hypotension.\\nHer history included an inferior myocardial infarc-\\ntion 19 years earlier; hypertension; renal insufficiency\\nascribed to chronic pyelonephritis, with a creatinine\\nlevel ranging from 1.8 to 2.2 mg per deciliter (159.1\\nto 194.5 µmol per liter); a left nephrectomy; and\\nchronic paranoid schizophrenia. There was a mass in\\nthe right middle lobe and a calcified right hilar lymph\\nnode, both of which had remained unchanged on\\nperiodic radiographic assessment for seven years.\\nTwelve weeks before the current admission, the\\npatient was admitted to the hospital because of syn-\\ncope with bladder and bowel incontinence. An elec-\\ntrocardiogram revealed a questionable old inferior\\nmyocardial infarct. A 24-hour electrocardiographic\\nmonitor showed no arrhythmia. Creatine kinase levels\\nwere normal. Computed tomographic (CT) studies\\nand magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed\\nno acute disease. A transthoracic cardiac ultrasono-\\ngraphic examination showed calcification of the mitral\\nannuli; Doppler evidence of mild mitral regurgita-\\ntion; slight aortic stenosis, with a peak transvalvular\\ngradient of 23 mm Hg and a mean transvalvular gra-\\ndient of 17 mm Hg; and slight, concentric left ven-\\ntricular hypertrophy. The aortic root and ascending\\naorta were 42 cm in diameter. The patient was dis-\\ncharged on the third hospital day.\\nTen weeks before the current admission, the pa-\\ntient became disoriented and was readmitted to the\\nhospital, where several tonic-clonic seizures were\\nwitnessed. Another cranial CT scan revealed a contu-\\nsion of the left frontal lobe with subarachnoid hem-\\norrhage. Phenytoin was administered. An evaluation\\nfor the cause of syncope was uninformative. The pa-\\ntient was transferred to a rehabilitation facility on\\nthe 13th hospital day.\\nFive days later, the patient was readmitted to the\\nhospital because of a volvulus of the sigmoid colon,\\nfor which a sigmoid resection and colostomy were\\nperformed. During this admission, a central venous\\ncatheter was inserted in the right internal jugular\\nvein. The patient was discharged to the rehabilitation\\nfacility.\\nFour days before the current admission, the pa-\\ntient became increasingly confused. She had a tem-\\nperature of 38.9°C and a white-cell count of over\\n32,000 per cubic millimeter. Hypotension, tachycar-\\ndia, and tachypnea developed. Treatment with gen-\\ntamicin and metronidazole was ineffective, and ceftri-\\naxone and ciprofloxacin were added. One day before\\nadmission, the venous catheter was replaced by a\\nright subclavian central venous catheter. The patient\\nwas transferred to this hospital.\\nThe temperature was 38.3°C, the pulse was 100,\\nand the respirations were 20. The systolic blood pres-\\nsure was 90 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was overweight and\\nappeared acutely ill. The heart rhythm was irregular.\\nA grade 3 systolic ejection murmur was heard at the\\nupper left sternal border and the apex. Coarse crack-\\nles were heard at both lung bases. A neurologic ex-\\namination showed normal findings.\\nThe urine was positive (+) for protein; the sedi-\\nment contained 0 to 2 red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, and\\nmoderate numbers of bacteria per high-power field.\\nLaboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2),\\nand arterial-blood gases were measured (Table 3). An\\nelectrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at a ven-\\ntricular rate of 90 beats per minute, with flattened\\nT waves in lead aVL. A chest radiograph (Fig. 1)\\nshowed interstitial pulmonary edema and slight car-\\ndiomegaly, with no change in the lung mass or in\\nthe calcified hilar lymph node. A culture of the tip of\\nthe venous catheter yielded abundant gram-positive\\ncocci in clusters.\\nSpecimens of blood were obtained for culture.\\nDigoxin, metronidazole, and one dose each of vanco-\\nmycin and gentamicin were given intravenously. Mini-\\ndose heparin was injected subcutaneously. An albu-\\nterol nebulizer was provided, and divalproex sodium,\\nhaloperidol, benztropine, sodium bicarbonate, and\\naspirin were administered orally. Two units of packed\\nred cells were transfused.\\nOn the second hospital day, the temperature was\\n37.7°C. Atrial fibrillation persisted at a ventricular\\nrate of 90 beats per minute, and the blood pressure\\nwas 100/65 mm Hg. The results of laboratory tests\\nare shown in Tables 1 and 2. Radiographs of the\\nchest revealed diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema\\nwith small pleural effusions. Cultures of two blood\\nspecimens obtained on admission contained gram-\\npositive cocci in clusters. High-degree atrioventricu-\\nlar block developed, with a junctional rhythm as slow\\nas 40 beats per minute, alternating with ventricular\\nbigeminy and intermittent, multifocal atrial tachycar-\\ndia. The hypotension became more severe. Use of an\\nexternal cardiac pacemaker increased the ventricular\\nrate to 70 beats per minute, and the systolic blood\\npressure rose to 90 mm Hg. Dopamine, phenyleph-\\nrine, and norepinephrine were administered intrave-\\nnously, with transient improvement.\\nOn the third day, the tachypnea increased. Arterial-\\nblood gases were measured (Table 3). The trachea\\nwas intubated, and ventilatory assistance was begun.\\nAtropine and digoxin immune Fab were given intra-\\nvenously, with temporary improvement. A firm cord\\nwas palpable in the location of the right jugular vein.\\nLaboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2).\\nThe culture from the tip of the venous catheter\\nyielded methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\\nDuring the day, it became necessary to administer\\nmaximal doses of pressor agents in order to maintain\\nblood pressure, and the patient became unrespon-\\nsive except to noxious stimuli. A grade 2 systolic\\nejection murmur was heard along the sternal border,\\nand a grade 4 apical systolic murmur radiated to the\\naxilla. A transthoracic cardiac ultrasonographic study\\nshowed a mobile, irregular, echo-producing vegeta-\\ntion on the midportion of the anterior mitral-valve\\nleaflet, with fine, linear, mobile echodensities on the\\nventricular surface of the aortic cusps. Additional find-\\nings included a shunt from the high left ventricular\\noutflow tract to the right atrium, with a high-velocity\\nsystolic jet and a low-velocity diastolic jet; Doppler\\nevidence of moderate mitral regurgitation; left atrial\\ndilatation; and left ventricular hypertrophy and hy-\\nperkinesis, without wall-motion abnormalities. The\\nestimated ejection fraction was 83 percent.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. DAVID E. GOSSMAN*: May we review the ra-\\ndiographs and the echocardiograms?\\nDR. STEPHEN W. MILLER: Chest radiography\\nperformed seven years before the current admission\\nshowed a large, calcified hilar lymph node above a\\nmass in the right middle lobe. The heart was slightly\\nenlarged. A chest radiograph obtained during the\\ncurrent admission (Fig. 1) shows no change except\\nfor the presence of diffuse pulmonary edema.\\nDR. NOAH LIEL-COHEN: A transthoracic echocar-\\ndiogram obtained 12 weeks before admission shows\\ncalcification of the mitral-valve annulus and mild mi-\\ntral regurgitation on color Doppler studies. There is\\ncalcification of the aortic-valve cusps, resulting in re-\\nstricted leaflet opening. The peak transaortic gradi-\\nent is 23 mm Hg. The left ventricle appears normal\\nexcept for concentric hypertrophy. The transthoracic\\nechocardiogram obtained on the third hospital day\\nshows a mobile mass that is consistent with the pres-\\nence of a vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet,\\nthickening of the cusps of the aortic valve, and re-\\nstricted motion. No evidence of an abscess is seen.\\nIn the subcostal view, color Doppler studies show a\\ncontinuous jet from the left ventricular outflow tract\\ninto the right atrium. Left and right ventricular\\nfunction appears normal.\\nDR. GOSSMAN: This patient's current hospitaliza-\\ntion, the fourth in 12 weeks, was heralded by con-\\nfusion, fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, which,\\nalong with rapid deterioration of her condition,\\nstrongly suggest septicemia.\\nHer first admission was prompted by syncope. In\\nits broadest definition, syncope is a sudden, transient\\nloss of consciousness that can be caused by multiple\\nfactors, although some authors require that it result\\nfrom a decrease in cerebral perfusion.¹ Syncope ac-\\ncounts for 3 percent of emergency room visits2 and\\nis equally frequent in men and women. Savage et al.\\nreported an incidence of 3 to 3.5 percent in a pop-\\nulation of men and women who were 26 to 62 years\\nold. The prevalence of syncope increases from less\\nthan 1 percent in persons under 44 years of age to\\n5.6 percent in those 75 years old or older; among\\npatients over the age of 75 and living in extended-\\ncare facilities, the annual incidence is 6 percent, and\\nthe recurrence rate is 30 percent.4-6\\nThe causes of syncope fall into four categories\\n(Table 4), but in up to 47 percent of patients, the\\ncause cannot be determined. The cause could not\\nbe established during this patient's first two hospi-\\ntalizations, but loss of bladder and bowel control be-\\nfore the first admission, which is rare with cardiac\\nsyncope, suggests a seizure disorder. During her sec-\\nond hospitalization, spontaneous tonic-clonic sei-\\nzures occurred in association with a cerebral contu-\\nsion and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Why would a\\n71-year-old woman suddenly have seizures? The least\\nlikely explanation is a ruptured mycotic aneurysm,\\nsince she did not have sepsis at this time. The CT\\nscans showed no tumor. Intermittent complete heart\\nblock causing inadequate cerebral perfusion is also\\nan unlikely explanation. Although calcification of the\\nmitral-valve annulus put the patient at higher risk for\\ninfra-Hisian block, the normal conduction intervals\\nand absence of other findings on 24-hour electro-\\ncardiographic monitoring suggest that the conduc-\\ntion system was intact. Since bradycardia was not\\nnoted, even though the patient was doubtless under-\\ngoing cardiac monitoring at the time of her seizures,\\nI shall rule out complete heart block with cerebral\\nhypoperfusion as the cause of her seizures.\\nAnother possible cause of the seizures is embolism\\nfrom a valvular vegetation, but the echocardiogram\\nobtained two weeks before the seizures occurred\\nshowed no vegetation. Since the patient had chronic\\nparanoid schizophrenia, she may have been taking\\nantipsychotic medication, which lowers the threshold\\nfor seizures, as do tricyclic antidepressants.7,8 The most\\nplausible explanation for the seizures is an episode of\\nparoxysmal atrial fibrillation that produced a throm-\\nboembolus, causing a small cerebral infarct that acted\\nas a seizure focus. However, such an episode would\\nnot account for the subarachnoid hemorrhage, which\\nis caused not by thromboembolism but by trauma,\\nexcessive anticoagulation, or rupture of a subarachnoid\\nvessel. In this patient, the parenchymal bleeding with\\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage is best explained by the\\nhead trauma resulting from the seizures.\\nThe patient was admitted a third time because of\\na volvulus of the sigmoid colon, the most common\\nsite of colonic volvulus, especially in persons over the\\nage of 60 years. Patients with neurologic or psychi-\\natric disorders, such as chronic schizophrenia, are at\\nincreased risk for volvulus, presumably because they\\nare frequently bedridden or because they are fre-\\nquently taking neuropsychotropic drugs known to\\nalter bowel motility. Both the volvulus and the cen-\\ntral venous catheter that was inserted in the right in-\\nternal jugular vein during this hospitalization were\\npossible sources of bacteremia. However, Staph. au-\\nreus, which was cultured from the tip of the replaced\\nvenous catheter, is unlikely to have been a bowel\\ncontaminant. A firm cord was eventually palpated in\\nthe location of the right jugular vein, a finding con-\\nsistent with the presence of septic thrombophlebitis.\\nCentral venous catheters were introduced in the\\n1970s and are now commonly used in critically ill pa-\\ntients. Septicemia is the most frequent and serious\\ncatheter-related complication, with infection rates\\nranging from 3 to 7 percent.10 Central venous cath-\\neters are colonized from multiple sources but most\\noften by microorganisms that colonize the skin at the\\nsite where the catheter is inserted. The organisms most\\ncommonly cultured are coagulase-negative staphylo-\\ncocci, predominantly Staph. epidermidis. Staph. aureus\\naccounts for only 14 to 20 percent of such infections\\nbut is much more virulent than Staph. epidermidis,\\nespecially when it results in endocarditis.11\\nDuring the current admission, the patient had the\\ntypical features of septic shock: confusion, fever, hy-\\npotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and profound ane-\\nmia. The platelet count was markedly reduced. A pos-\\nitive D-dimer test and elevations in the prothrombin\\ntime and the partial-thromboplastin time indicated\\nthe onset of disseminated intravascular coagulation,\\nalthough the fibrinogen level remained normal.\\nThe physical and radiographic examinations indicat-\\ned pulmonary edema. Since the left ventricular func-\\ntion was normal, the pulmonary edema reflected the\\npresence of either acute respiratory distress syndrome\\nor a valvular lesion, such as newly acquired mitral in-\\nsufficiency, that was not detected on physical exam-\\nination and only later became overt. The tachycardia\\nmight well have made a new murmur difficult to hear.\\nDespite atrial fibrillation, the heart rate was only\\n100 beats per minute before the administration of\\ndigoxin. Since one would have expected a ventricular\\nresponse rate approaching 150 beats per minute, the\\nlower rate is the first clue that the atrioventricular\\nconduction system was becoming functionally com-\\npromised. Within a day, there was progression to\\nhigh-degree atrioventricular block. The suspicion of\\nacute bacterial endocarditis must be very strong at this\\npoint, even before detection of a new heart murmur\\nand performance of the second echocardiographic\\nstudy. The preexisting valvular lesions, however mild,\\npredisposed the patient to endocarditis. Any cardiac\\nlesion that causes abnormal turbulence against an\\nendothelial surface promotes adhesion of thrombin\\nand platelets that attract circulating bacteria.\\nBacterial endocarditis has been divided into sub-\\nacute and acute forms. The subacute form lasts for a\\nperiod of weeks to months, whereas the acute form\\nis rapidly progressive. Many cases, however, cannot be\\nneatly categorized as one form or the other. Sub-\\nacute bacterial endocarditis is caused by organisms of\\nrelatively low virulence, typically viridans streptococci,\\nand often follows dental procedures. The disease is\\ncaused less frequently by group D streptococci, and\\nthis type often follows genitourinary manipulation.\\nThe usual symptoms of subacute bacterial endocar-\\nditis are a low-grade fever and a heart murmur of low\\nintensity, with splenomegaly and petechiae on the\\nskin, conjunctivae, or oral mucosa, although many\\npatients do not have all these signs and symptoms.\\nPatients almost always present with anorexia, weight\\nloss, and anemia — findings easily confused with those\\nof other chronic illnesses, such as a carcinoma. The\\ndiagnosis is confirmed by a positive blood culture.\\nIn contrast, acute bacterial endocarditis is often\\ncatastrophic and is frequently associated with meta-\\nstatic foci of infection. Its causative agents include\\nmore virulent bacteria, usually Staph. aureus, but Strep-\\ntococcus pyogenes, Strep. pneumoniae, Neisseria gonor-\\nrhoeae, and Haemophilus influenzae may also cause\\nacute endocarditis. The course, lasting days to weeks,\\nis often too brief for the development of splenomeg-\\naly.12 The disease can be particularly destructive to\\nthe heart, as well as to other organs containing sep-\\ntic emboli. This patient had at least two of the vari-\\nous cardiac lesions listed in Table 5. The first lesion\\npresented as atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular\\nresponse, ultimately progressing to complete heart\\nblock. In one series of 142 patients with bacterial\\nendocarditis,13 6 had complete heart block (4 per-\\ncent) and 14 had first-degree or second-degree atri-\\noventricular block (10 percent). The frequency of\\ncomplete heart block was 11 percent in patients with\\nisolated involvement of the aortic valve. In all six cases\\nof complete heart block, the aortic valve was the site\\nof preexisting disease, as in this case, and in five of\\nthe six cases, the infection extended beyond the aor-\\ntic wall, forming mycotic aneurysms and fistulas.\\nAn understanding of cardiac anatomy helps to con-\\nceptualize the problem in this patient. The atrioven-\\ntricular node lies in the right atrium, behind and to\\nthe right of the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva. Below\\nthe noncoronary cusp lies the membranous portion\\nof the interventricular septum, through which the\\nbundle of His travels. Both the atrioventricular node\\nand the bundle of His are close to the aortic valve.\\nTherefore, evidence of first-degree heart block sug-\\ngests an abscess near the noncoronary sinus of Val-\\nsalva, and evidence of complete heart block suggests\\nan abscess in the membranous septum.14 In this case,\\neven before seeing the second echocardiogram, one\\nwould suspect the presence of specific destructive\\nlesions in the region of the membranous septum.\\nThe direction and orientation of the Doppler jet\\nin the second echocardiographic study establish the\\npresence of a fistula between the left ventricular out-\\nflow tract and the right atrium. Furthermore, the\\nsystolic and diastolic Doppler velocities distinguish\\nthis fistula, which was due to necrosis, from other\\ntypes of fistula at this level. With the rupture of an\\naneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva into the right atri-\\num, for example, the diastolic pressure gradient in the\\naorta (approximately 65 mm Hg) and in the right\\natrium or right ventricle (approximately 10 mm Hg)\\nwould have caused a high-velocity diastolic jet. In\\ncontrast, this patient had a low-velocity diastolic jet\\nfrom the left ventricular outflow tract into the right\\natrium, caused by a relatively low diastolic pressure\\ngradient (typically 15 mm Hg in the left ventricle\\nand 10 mm Hg in the right atrium).\\nAbscesses are the basis of the formation of fistulas\\nsuch as the one this patient had. Ring abscesses were\\nfound in 27 of 95 patients who died from acute bac-\\nterial endocarditis of native valves. 15 The aortic valve\\nwas the site of the ring abscess in 24 of the 27 pa-\\ntients. There was some aortic insufficiency in all the\\npatients, as there was in the patient under discussion.\\nFistulas may form between virtually any two adja-\\ncent cardiac structures after one of the structures has\\nbecome infected, causing a communication from the\\nleft ventricle to the right atrium, the left ventricle to\\nthe right ventricle, the aorta to the right atrium, the\\naorta to the left atrium, the aorta to pericardium, or\\nthe left ventricle to pericardium.\\nThe second echocardiogram in this patient also\\nshowed an increase in mitral regurgitation, which may\\nbe attributed to several causes in this setting. Dila-\\ntation of a valve ring, associated with a dilated ven-\\ntricle, may cause an increase in mitral regurgitation,\\nbut the ventricular dimensions in this patient were\\nnormal. Another possible cause is disruption of sub-\\nvalvular structures, such as the chordae or papillary\\nmuscles of the mitral valve, but there was no disrup-\\ntion in this case. The large vegetation could have\\nprevented coaptation of the valve leaflets, account-\\ning for the increase in mitral regurgitation. Finally,\\nperforation of the mitral-valve leaflet could have re-\\nsulted in worsening mitral insufficiency.\\nThe case at this point, with hemodynamic deterio-\\nration, a new left-to-right shunt, and evidence of the\\ndestruction of two valves, called for emergency sur-\\ngery. The risk of perioperative death was high, but\\nwithout surgical intervention, death would have been\\nvirtually certain. Surgical planning was indicated. Al-\\nthough aortic-ring abscesses were not noted on the\\nsecond transthoracic echocardiogram, they were prob-\\nably present. The ability of transthoracic echocardi-\\nography to detect endocarditis is critical. Its sensitiv-\\nity is limited in patients with chronic obstructive lung\\ndisease or chest dimensions that are unfavorable, as\\nthey were in this case. Over the past decade, trans-\\nesophageal echocardiography has become an increas-\\ningly reliable tool in detecting and evaluating cardiac\\nlesions. In a study of 118 patients with active bacterial\\nendocarditis,16 transesophageal echocardiography had\\na sensitivity of 87 percent for the detection of myo-\\ncardial abscesses, as compared with 29 percent with\\nstandard transthoracic echocardiography. In another\\nstudy, abscess formation, leaflet perforation, noncal-\\ncified leaflet thickening, flail chordal structures, and\\nvegetations were found far more often with trans-\\nesophageal echocardiography than with transthoracic\\nechocardiography (96 percent vs. 68 percent for le-\\nsions on the aortic valve, and 100 percent vs. 89 per-\\ncent for lesions on the mitral valve).17\\nThis case required, at the very least, debridement\\nand repair of the mitral-valve septum and replace-\\nment of the mitral valve. Destructive vegetations were\\nprobably present on the aortic valve as well as the mi-\\ntral valve. Ordinarily, the diagnostic procedure of\\nchoice would be transesophageal echocardiography,\\nfollowed by coronary arteriography in preparation for\\nemergency surgery. Alternatively, one could perform\\nonly transesophageal echocardiography preoperatively.\\nHowever, one must consider the moribund, septic\\ncondition of this patient and whether she would have\\nsurvived an attempt to replace both the mitral valve\\nand the aortic valve. In a patient in this condition,\\nthe risk of death associated with simultaneous re-\\nplacement of the aortic and mitral valves is approxi-\\nmately 10 to 15 percent; in this patient, the risk would\\nprobably have exceeded 75 percent.\\nIn summary, this patient had acute bacterial endo-\\ncarditis caused by Staph. aureus infection after septic\\nthrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein. Septic\\nperforation of the membranous portion of the inter-\\nventricular septum caused the formation of a fistula\\nfrom the left ventricular outflow tract to the right\\natrium. Vegetations were probably present on the\\naortic and mitral valves. Transesophageal echocardi-\\nography probably showed an aortic-ring abscess and\\npossibly showed additional destructive lesions, in\\nparticular, multiple abscesses or perforation of the\\nmitral-valve leaflet.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nAcute bacterial endocarditis, involving the mitral\\nand aortic valves, due to Staph. aureus infection,\\nwith a fistula between the left ventricle and the\\nright atrium.\\n\\nDR. DAVID E. GOSSMAN’S DIAGNOSES\\nAcute bacterial endocarditis, involving the mitral\\nand aortic valves, due to central-venous-cathe-\\nter infection with Staph. aureus. — Aortic-\\nring abscess and perforation of the mem-\\nbranous interventricular septum with a fistula\\nbetween the left ventricle and the right atrium.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. LIEL-COHEN: The diagnostic procedure was\\na transesophageal echocardiographic study (Fig. 2).\\nIn the four-chamber midesophageal view, there was\\na large, mobile echodensity on the anterior mitral-\\nvalve leaflet. At the base of the leaflet, there was a\\nfenestration, causing severe mitral regurgitation. In\\nthe short-axis and long-axis views, the aortic-valve\\ncusps appeared thickened and calcified, but there was\\nno evidence of a vegetation or an aortic-root abscess.\\nIn the views of the left ventricular outflow tract, a\\narrow jet passed through the membranous septum\\nterminating in the right atrium. There was moderate\\ntricuspid insufficiency but no evidence of vegeta-\\ntions on the tricuspid valve. A patent foramen ovale\\nwith a minimal left-to-right shunt was noted on color\\nDoppler studies.\\nDR. GUY REED: The cardiac surgeons discussed\\nemergency surgery with the patient’s family. Al-\\nthough surgery provided the only hope for survival,\\nit offered a very high risk of death and, if successful,\\nwould have entailed a long, difficult recovery. The\\nprognosis was poor because of progressive obtunda-\\ntion and renal failure, as well as refractory hypoten-\\nsion. The family thought that heroic measures would\\nbe inconsistent with the patient’s wishes, and she\\ndied shortly after the discussion.\\nDR. EIRA BROGI: At autopsy, the heart weighed\\n425 g. A fibrinopurulent exudate covered the epi-\\ncardium on the lateral and posterior surfaces of the\\nleft ventricle and surrounded the aortic root. Both\\natria were dilated. In the right atrium, below the fo-\\nramen ovale, there was a polypoid, ulcerated lesion,\\nmeasuring 0.6 cm by 0.6 cm by 0.3 cm (Fig. 3). The\\nulcer communicated with a fistula that entered the\\nleft atrium as well as the left ventricle.\\nA red, soft, friable vegetation occupied the non-\\ncoronary cusp of the aortic valve and the anterior\\nleaflet of the mitral valve (Fig. 4). The vegetation ex-\\ntended to the mitral-valve annulus and into the sub-\\njacent myocardium to form an abscess, which ex-\\ntended to the portion of the membranous septum\\nthat separates the right atrium and left ventricle, re-\\nsulting in the fistula (Fig. 5). The region of involve-\\nment by infection is important, because it is the site\\nof critical components of the cardiac conduction\\nsystem, including the atrioventricular node and the\\nproximal portion of the bundle of His (Fig. 6).\\nOn microscopical examination, the mitral-valve veg-\\netation consisted of a clot, necrotic debris, and colo-\\nnies of cocci (Fig. 7). Cultures of the vegetation\\nyielded Staph. aureus and enterococci. The myocar-\\ndium contained scattered foci of necrosis with in-\\nfiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Some\\nintramyocardial arterioles were occluded by throm-\\nboemboli. In addition to the cardiac findings, micro-\\nscopical abscesses were found in both kidneys. The\\nlung nodule that had remained unchanged radio-\\ngraphically for years was a well-circumscribed bron-\\nchial carcinoid, 5 cm by 3 cm by 2 cm.\\nA fistula between the right atrium and left ventricle\\nis exceedingly rare and can be congenital or ac-\\nquired. A congenital communication between the\\nleft ventricle and the right atrium accounts for less\\nthan 1 percent of all cases of congenital heart dis-\\nease. 18 In the case of a congenital fistula, the defect\\nlies in the uppermost portion of the muscular septum\\nand is associated with anomalies of the tricuspid\\nvalve. Even rarer is an acquired shunt between the left\\nventricle and the right atrium, which may be caused\\nby surgical trauma during the replacement of an aor-\\ntic valve19 or a mitral valve, 20-23 chest trauma, 24 ische-\\nmic heart disease, 25 or infective endocarditis. 26-28 In\\n60 to 90 percent of the cases associated with infec-\\ntive endocarditis, a congenital or acquired structural\\nabnormality of the heart was present.\\nDR.

      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Information Gathering:**\n",
      "    *   **Key Signs/Symptoms:** Fever, dyspnea, hypotension, confusion, seizures, tachycardia, tachypnea, positive urine for protein, new murmur, pulmonary edema, septic shock (hypotension, leukocytosis, coagulopathy).\n",
      "    *   **Duration:** The symptoms developed over a period of several weeks, with a recent hospitalization for a volvulus and central venous catheter placement.\n",
      "    *   **Epidemiologic Context:** The patient has a history of chronic paranoid schizophrenia, chronic pyelonephritis, and a recent central venous catheter placement.\n",
      "    *   **Comorbidities/Medications:** Hypertension, renal insufficiency, mitral valve calcification, aortic valve calcification, and a history of myocardial infarction.\n",
      "    *   **Red-Flag Features:** Septic shock, new murmur, new fistula, and the presence of a vegetation on the mitral valve.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\n",
      "    *   **Systemic:** Septic shock, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\n",
      "    *   **Cardiovascular:** Acute bacterial endocarditis, mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, new left-to-right shunt.\n",
      "    *   **Neurological:** Seizures, confusion.\n",
      "    *   **Other:** Pulmonary edema, possible renal abscesses.\n",

      "3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
      "    *   **Defining Features:** The presence of a vegetation on the mitral valve, the new murmur, the septic shock, and the new fistula are highly suggestive of endocarditis.\n",
      "    *   **Discriminatory Features:** The history of central venous catheter placement strongly suggests a source of infection. The presence of a fistula between the left ventricle and the right atrium is a rare but important finding.\n",
      "    *   **Point-of-Care Tests:** Blood cultures are essential to identify the causative organism. A transthoracic echocardiogram can visualize the vegetation and assess the severity of valve damage.\n",
      "    *   **Labs:** Complete blood count (CBC) to assess for anemia and thrombocytopenia, coagulation studies (PT, PTT, fibrinogen) to evaluate for DIC, renal function tests to assess for acute kidney injury, and inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) to support the diagnosis of infection.\n",
      "    *   **Imaging:** Chest X-ray to assess for pulmonary edema and other lung abnormalities. CT scan of the chest to evaluate for lung masses and other potential sources of infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:**\n",
      "    *   The patient's presentation is consistent with acute bacterial endocarditis, likely caused by Staph. aureus, given the history of central venous catheter placement. The presence of a fistula between the left ventricle and the right atrium is a rare but important finding that can contribute to septic shock.

CABOT\\n\\nROBERT E. SCULLY, M.D., Editor\\nEUGENE J. MARK, M.D., Associate Editor\\nWILLIAM F. MCNEELY, M.D., Associate Editor\\nSALLY H. EBELING, Assistant Editor\\n\\nCase 34-1998\\n\\nPRESENTATION OF CASE\\nA 71-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital\\nbecause of fever, dyspnea, and hypotension.\\nHer history included an inferior myocardial infarc-\\ntion 19 years earlier; hypertension; renal insufficiency\\nascribed to chronic pyelonephritis, with a creatinine\\nlevel ranging from 1.8 to 2.2 mg per deciliter (159.1\\nto 194.5 µmol per liter); a left nephrectomy; and\\nchronic paranoid schizophrenia. There was a mass in\\nthe right middle lobe and a calcified right hilar lymph\\nnode, both of which had remained unchanged on\\nperiodic radiographic assessment for seven years.\\nTwelve weeks before the current admission, the\\npatient was admitted to the hospital because of syn-\\ncope with bladder and bowel incontinence. An elec-\\ntrocardiogram revealed a questionable old inferior\\nmyocardial infarct. A 24-hour electrocardiographic\\nmonitor showed no arrhythmia. Creatine kinase levels\\nwere normal. Computed tomographic (CT) studies\\nand magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed\\nno acute disease. A transthoracic cardiac ultrasono-\\ngraphic examination showed calcification of the mitral\\nannuli; Doppler evidence of mild mitral regurgita-\\ntion; slight aortic stenosis, with a peak transvalvular\\ngradient of 23 mm Hg and a mean transvalvular gra-\\ndient of 17 mm Hg; and slight, concentric left ven-\\ntricular hypertrophy. The aortic root and ascending\\naorta were 42 cm in diameter. The patient was dis-\\ncharged on the third hospital day.\\nTen weeks before the current admission, the pa-\\ntient became disoriented and was readmitted to the\\nhospital, where several tonic-clonic seizures were\\nwitnessed. Another cranial CT scan revealed a contu-\\nsion of the left frontal lobe with subarachnoid hem-\\norrhage. Phenytoin was administered. An evaluation\\nfor the cause of syncope was uninformative. The pa-\\ntient was transferred to a rehabilitation facility on\\nthe 13th hospital day.\\nFive days later, the patient was readmitted to the\\nhospital because of a volvulus of the sigmoid colon,\\nfor which a sigmoid resection and colostomy were\\nperformed. During this admission, a central venous\\ncatheter was inserted in the right internal jugular\\nvein. The patient was discharged to the rehabilitation\\nfacility.\\nFour days before the current admission, the pa-\\ntient became increasingly confused. She had a tem-\\nperature of 38.9°C and a white-cell count of over\\n32,000 per cubic millimeter. Hypotension, tachycar-\\ndia, and tachypnea developed. Treatment with gen-\\ntamicin and metronidazole was ineffective, and ceftri-\\naxone and ciprofloxacin were added. One day before\\nadmission, the venous catheter was replaced by a\\nright subclavian central venous catheter. The patient\\nwas transferred to this hospital.\\nThe temperature was 38.3°C, the pulse was 100,\\nand the respirations were 20. The systolic blood pres-\\nsure was 90 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was overweight and\\nappeared acutely ill. The heart rhythm was irregular.\\nA grade 3 systolic ejection murmur was heard at the\\nupper left sternal border and the apex. Coarse crack-\\nles were heard at both lung bases. A neurologic ex-\\namination showed normal findings.\\nThe urine was positive (+) for protein; the sedi-\\nment contained 0 to 2 red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, and\\nmoderate numbers of bacteria per high-power field.\\nLaboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2),\\nand arterial-blood gases were measured (Table 3). An\\nelectrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at a ven-\\ntricular rate of 90 beats per minute, with flattened\\nT waves in lead aVL. A chest radiograph (Fig. 1)\\nshowed interstitial pulmonary edema and slight car-\\ndiomegaly, with no change in the lung mass or in\\nthe calcified hilar lymph node. A culture of the tip of\\nthe venous catheter yielded abundant gram-positive\\ncocci in clusters.\\nSpecimens of blood were obtained for culture.\\nDigoxin, metronidazole, and one dose each of vanco-\\nmycin and gentamicin were given intravenously. Mini-\\ndose heparin was injected subcutaneously. An albu-\\nterol nebulizer was provided, and divalproex sodium,\\nhaloperidol, benztropine, sodium bicarbonate, and\\naspirin were administered orally. Two units of packed\\nred cells were transfused.\\nOn the second hospital day, the temperature was\\n37.7°C. Atrial fibrillation persisted at a ventricular\\nrate of 90 beats per minute, and the blood pressure\\nwas 100/65 mm Hg. The results of laboratory tests\\nare shown in Tables 1 and 2. Radiographs of the\\nchest revealed diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema\\nwith small pleural effusions. Cultures of two blood\\nspecimens obtained on admission contained gram-\\npositive cocci in clusters. High-degree atrioventricu-\\nlar block developed, with a junctional rhythm as slow\\nas 40 beats per minute, alternating with ventricular\\nbigeminy and intermittent, multifocal atrial tachycar-\\ndia. The hypotension became more severe. Use of an\\nexternal cardiac pacemaker increased the ventricular\\nrate to 70 beats per minute, and the systolic blood\\npressure rose to 90 mm Hg. Dopamine, phenyleph-\\nrine, and norepinephrine were administered intrave-\\nnously, with transient improvement.\\nOn the third day, the tachypnea increased. Arterial-\\nblood gases were measured (Table 3). The trachea\\nwas intubated, and ventilatory assistance was begun.\\nAtropine and digoxin immune Fab were given intra-\\nvenously, with temporary improvement. A firm cord\\nwas palpable in the location of the right jugular vein.\\nLaboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2).\\nThe culture from the tip of the venous catheter\\nyielded methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\\nDuring the day, it became necessary to administer\\nmaximal doses of pressor agents in order to maintain\\nblood pressure, and the patient became unrespon-\\nsive except to noxious stimuli. A grade 2 systolic\\nejection murmur was heard along the sternal border,\\nand a grade 4 apical systolic murmur radiated to the\\naxilla. A transthoracic cardiac ultrasonographic study\\nshowed a mobile, irregular, echo-producing vegeta-\\ntion on the midportion of the anterior mitral-valve\\nleaflet, with fine, linear, mobile echodensities on the\\nventricular surface of the aortic cusps. Additional find-\\nings included a shunt from the high left ventricular\\noutflow tract to the right atrium, with a high-velocity\\nsystolic jet and a low-velocity diastolic jet; Doppler\\nevidence of moderate mitral regurgitation; left atrial\\ndilatation; and left ventricular hypertrophy and hy-\\nperkinesis, without wall-motion abnormalities. The\\nestimated ejection fraction was 83 percent.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. DAVID E. GOSSMAN*: May we review the ra-\\ndiographs and the echocardiograms?\\nDR. STEPHEN W. MILLER: Chest radiography\\nperformed seven years before the current admission\\nshowed a large, calcified hilar lymph node above a\\nmass in the right middle lobe. The heart was slightly\\nenlarged. A chest radiograph obtained during the\\ncurrent admission (Fig. 1) shows no change except\\nfor the presence of diffuse pulmonary edema.\\nDR. NOAH LIEL-COHEN: A transthoracic echocar-\\ndiogram obtained 12 weeks before admission shows\\ncalcification of the mitral-valve annulus and mild mi-\\ntral regurgitation on color Doppler studies. There is\\ncalcification of the aortic-valve cusps, resulting in re-\\nstricted leaflet opening. The peak transaortic gradi-\\nent is 23 mm Hg. The left ventricle appears normal\\nexcept for concentric hypertrophy. The transthoracic\\nechocardiogram obtained on the third hospital day\\nshows a mobile mass that is consistent with the pres-\\nence of a vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet,\\nthickening of the cusps of the aortic valve, and re-\\nstricted motion. No evidence of an abscess is seen.\\nIn the subcostal view, color Doppler studies show a\\ncontinuous jet from the left ventricular outflow tract\\ninto the right atrium. Left and right ventricular\\nfunction appears normal.\\nDR. GOSSMAN: This patient's current hospitaliza-\\ntion, the fourth in 12 weeks, was heralded by con-\\nfusion, fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension, which,\\nalong with rapid deterioration of her condition,\\nstrongly suggest septicemia.\\nHer first admission was prompted by syncope. In\\nits broadest definition, syncope is a sudden, transient\\nloss of consciousness that can be caused by multiple\\nfactors, although some authors require that it result\\nfrom a decrease in cerebral perfusion.¹ Syncope ac-\\ncounts for 3 percent of emergency room visits2 and\\nis equally frequent in men and women. Savage et al.\\nreported an incidence of 3 to 3.5 percent in a pop-\\nulation of men and women who were 26 to 62 years\\nold. The prevalence of syncope increases from less\\nthan 1 percent in persons under 44 years of age to\\n5.6 percent in those 75 years old or older; among\\npatients over the age of 75 and living in extended-\\ncare facilities, the annual incidence is 6 percent, and\\nthe recurrence rate is 30 percent.4-6\\nThe causes of syncope fall into four categories\\n(Table 4), but in up to 47 percent of patients, the\\ncause cannot be determined. The cause could not\\nbe established during this patient's first two hospi-\\ntalizations, but loss of bladder and bowel control be-\\nfore the first admission, which is rare with cardiac\\nsyncope, suggests a seizure disorder. During her sec-\\nond hospitalization, spontaneous tonic-clonic sei-\\nzures occurred in association with a cerebral contu-\\nsion and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Why would a\\n71-year-old woman suddenly have seizures? The least\\nlikely explanation is a ruptured mycotic aneurysm,\\nsince she did not have sepsis at this time. The CT\\nscans showed no tumor. Intermittent complete heart\\nblock causing inadequate cerebral perfusion is also\\nan unlikely explanation. Although calcification of the\\nmitral-valve annulus put the patient at higher risk for\\ninfra-Hisian block, the normal conduction intervals\\nand absence of other findings on 24-hour electro-\\ncardiographic monitoring suggest that the conduc-\\ntion system was intact. Since bradycardia was not\\nnoted, even though the patient was doubtless under-\\ngoing cardiac monitoring at the time of her seizures,\\nI shall rule out complete heart block with cerebral\\nhypoperfusion as the cause of her seizures.\\nAnother possible cause of the seizures is embolism\\nfrom a valvular vegetation, but the echocardiogram\\nobtained two weeks before the seizures occurred\\nshowed no vegetation. Since the patient had chronic\\nparanoid schizophrenia, she may have been taking\\nantipsychotic medication, which lowers the threshold\\nfor seizures, as do tricyclic antidepressants.7,8 The most\\nplausible explanation for the seizures is an episode of\\nparoxysmal atrial fibrillation that produced a throm-\\nboembolus, causing a small cerebral infarct that acted\\nas a seizure focus. However, such an episode would\\nnot account for the subarachnoid hemorrhage, which\\nis caused not by thromboembolism but by trauma,\\nexcessive anticoagulation, or rupture of a subarachnoid\\nvessel. In this patient, the parenchymal bleeding with\\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage is best explained by the\\nhead trauma resulting from the seizures.\\nThe patient was admitted a third time because of\\na volvulus of the sigmoid colon, the most common\\nsite of colonic volvulus, especially in persons over the\\nage of 60 years. Patients with neurologic or psychi-\\natric disorders, such as chronic schizophrenia, are at\\nincreased risk for volvulus, presumably because they\\nare frequently bedridden or because they are fre-\\nquently taking neuropsychotropic drugs known to\\nalter bowel motility. Both the volvulus and the cen-\\ntral venous catheter that was inserted in the right in-\\nternal jugular vein during this hospitalization were\\npossible sources of bacteremia. However, Staph. au-\\nreus, which was cultured from the tip of the replaced\\nvenous catheter, is unlikely to have been a bowel\\ncontaminant. A firm cord was eventually palpated in\\nthe location of the right jugular vein, a finding con-\\nsistent with the presence of septic thrombophlebitis.\\nCentral venous catheters were introduced in the\\n1970s and are now commonly used in critically ill pa-\\ntients. Septicemia is the most frequent and serious\\ncatheter-related complication, with infection rates\\nranging from 3 to 7 percent.10 Central venous cath-\\neters are colonized from multiple sources but most\\noften by microorganisms that colonize the skin at the\\nsite where the catheter is inserted. The organisms most\\ncommonly cultured are coagulase-negative staphylo-\\ncocci, predominantly Staph. epidermidis. Staph. aureus\\naccounts for only 14 to 20 percent of such infections\\nbut is much more virulent than Staph. epidermidis,\\nespecially when it results in endocarditis.11\\nDuring the current admission, the patient had the\\ntypical features of septic shock: confusion, fever, hy-\\npotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and profound ane-\\nmia. The platelet count was markedly reduced. A pos-\\nitive D-dimer test and elevations in the prothrombin\\ntime and the partial-thromboplastin time indicated\\nthe onset of disseminated intravascular coagulation,\\nalthough the fibrinogen level remained normal.\\nThe physical and radiographic examinations indicat-\\ned pulmonary edema. Since the left ventricular func-\\ntion was normal, the pulmonary edema reflected the\\npresence of either acute respiratory distress syndrome\\nor a valvular lesion, such as newly acquired mitral in-\\nsufficiency, that was not detected on physical exam-\\nination and only later became overt. The tachycardia\\nmight well have made a new murmur difficult to hear.\\nDespite atrial fibrillation, the heart rate was only\\n100 beats per minute before the administration of\\ndigoxin. Since one would have expected a ventricular\\nresponse rate approaching 150 beats per minute, the\\nlower rate is the first clue that the atrioventricular\\nconduction system was becoming functionally com-\\npromised. Within a day, there was progression to\\nhigh-degree atrioventricular block. The suspicion of\\nacute bacterial endocarditis must be very strong at this\\npoint, even before detection of a new heart murmur\\nand performance of the second echocardiographic\\nstudy. The preexisting valvular lesions, however mild,\\npredisposed the patient to endocarditis. Any cardiac\\nlesion that causes abnormal turbulence against an\\nendothelial surface promotes adhesion of thrombin\\nand platelets that attract circulating bacteria.\\nBacterial endocarditis has been divided into sub-\\nacute and acute forms. The subacute form lasts for a\\nperiod of weeks to months, whereas the acute form\\nis rapidly progressive. Many cases, however, cannot be\\nneatly categorized as one form or the other. Sub-\\nacute bacterial endocarditis is caused by organisms of\\nrelatively low virulence, typically viridans streptococci,\\nand often follows dental procedures. The disease is\\ncaused less frequently by group D streptococci, and\\nthis type often follows genitourinary manipulation.\\nThe usual symptoms of subacute bacterial endocar-\\nditis are a low-grade fever and a heart murmur of low\\nintensity, with splenomegaly and petechiae on the\\nskin, conjunctivae, or oral mucosa, although many\\npatients do not have all these signs and symptoms.\\nPatients almost always present with anorexia, weight\\nloss, and anemia — findings easily confused with those\\nof other chronic illnesses, such as a carcinoma. The\\ndiagnosis is confirmed by a positive blood culture.\\nIn contrast, acute bacterial endocarditis is often\\ncatastrophic and is frequently associated with meta-\\nstatic foci of infection. Its causative agents include\\nmore virulent bacteria, usually Staph. aureus, but Strep-\\ntococcus pyogenes, Strep. pneumoniae, Neisseria gonor-\\nrhoeae, and Haemophilus influenzae may also cause\\nacute endocarditis. The course, lasting days to weeks,\\nis often too brief for the development of splenomeg-\\naly.12 The disease can be particularly destructive to\\nthe heart, as well as to other organs containing sep-\\ntic emboli. This patient had at least two of the vari-\\nous cardiac lesions listed in Table 5. The first lesion\\npresented as atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular\\nresponse, ultimately progressing to complete heart\\nblock. In one series of 142 patients with bacterial\\nendocarditis,13 6 had complete heart block (4 per-\\ncent) and 14 had first-degree or second-degree atri-\\noventricular block (10 percent). The frequency of\\ncomplete heart block was 11 percent in patients with\\nisolated involvement of the aortic valve. In all six cases\\nof complete heart block, the aortic valve was the site\\nof preexisting disease, as in this case, and in five of\\nthe six cases, the infection extended beyond the aor-\\ntic wall, forming mycotic aneurysms and fistulas.\\nAn understanding of cardiac anatomy helps to con-\\nceptualize the problem in this patient. The atrioven-\\ntricular node lies in the right atrium, behind and to\\nthe right of the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva. Below\\nthe noncoronary cusp lies the membranous portion\\nof the interventricular septum, through which the\\nbundle of His travels. Both the atrioventricular node\\nand the bundle of His are close to the aortic valve.\\nTherefore, evidence of first-degree heart block sug-\\ngests an abscess near the noncoronary sinus of Val-\\nsalva, and evidence of complete heart block suggests\\nan abscess in the membranous septum.14 In this case,\\neven before seeing the second echocardiogram, one\\nwould suspect the presence of specific destructive\\nlesions in the region of the membranous septum.\\nThe direction and orientation of the Doppler jet\\nin the second echocardiographic study establish the\\npresence of a fistula between the left ventricular out-\\nflow tract and the right atrium. Furthermore, the\\nsystolic and diastolic Doppler velocities distinguish\\nthis fistula, which was due to necrosis, from other\\ntypes of fistula at this level. With the rupture of an\\naneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva into the right atri-\\num, for example, the diastolic pressure gradient in the\\naorta (approximately 65 mm Hg) and in the right\\natrium or right ventricle (approximately 10 mm Hg)\\nwould have caused a high-velocity diastolic jet. In\\ncontrast, this patient had a low-velocity diastolic jet\\nfrom the left ventricular outflow tract into the right\\natrium, caused by a relatively low diastolic pressure\\ngradient (typically 15 mm Hg in the left ventricle\\nand 10 mm Hg in the right atrium).\\nAbscesses are the basis of the formation of fistulas\\nsuch as the one this patient had. Ring abscesses were\\nfound in 27 of 95 patients who died from acute bac-\\nterial endocarditis of native valves. 15 The aortic valve\\nwas the site of the ring abscess in 24 of the 27 pa-\\ntients. There was some aortic insufficiency in all the\\npatients, as there was in the patient under discussion.\\nFistulas may form between virtually any two adja-\\ncent cardiac structures after one of the structures has\\nbecome infected, causing a communication from the\\nleft ventricle to the right atrium, the left ventricle to\\nthe right ventricle, the aorta to the right atrium, the\\naorta to the left atrium, the aorta to pericardium, or\\nthe left ventricle to pericardium.\\nThe second echocardiogram in this patient also\\nshowed an increase in mitral regurgitation, which may\\nbe attributed to several causes in this setting. Dila-\\ntation of a valve ring, associated with a dilated ven-\\ntricle, may cause an increase in mitral regurgitation,\\nbut the ventricular dimensions in this patient were\\nnormal. Another possible cause is disruption of sub-\\nvalvular structures, such as the chordae or papillary\\nmuscles of the mitral valve, but there was no disrup-\\ntion in this case. The large vegetation could have\\nprevented coaptation of the valve leaflets, account-\\ning for the increase in mitral regurgitation. Finally,\\nperforation of the mitral-valve leaflet could have re-\\nsulted in worsening mitral insufficiency.\\nThe case at this point, with hemodynamic deterio-\\nration, a new left-to-right shunt, and evidence of the\\ndestruction of two valves, called for emergency sur-\\ngery. The risk of perioperative death was high, but\\nwithout surgical intervention, death would have been\\nvirtually certain. Surgical planning was indicated. Al-\\nthough aortic-ring abscesses were not noted on the\\nsecond transthoracic echocardiogram, they were prob-\\nably present. The ability of transthoracic echocardi-\\nography to detect endocarditis is critical. Its sensitiv-\\nity is limited in patients with chronic obstructive lung\\ndisease or chest dimensions that are unfavorable, as\\nthey were in this case. Over the past decade, trans-\\nesophageal echocardiography has become an increas-\\ningly reliable tool in detecting and evaluating cardiac\\nlesions. In a study of 118 patients with active bacterial\\nendocarditis,16 transesophageal echocardiography had\\na sensitivity of 87 percent for the detection of myo-\\ncardial abscesses, as compared with 29 percent with\\nstandard transthoracic echocardiography. In another\\nstudy, abscess formation, leaflet perforation, noncal-\\ncified leaflet thickening, flail chordal structures, and\\nvegetations were found far more often with trans-\\nesophageal echocardiography than with transthoracic\\nechocardiography (96 percent vs. 68 percent for le-\\nsions on the aortic valve, and 100 percent vs. 89 per-\\ncent for lesions on the mitral valve).17\\nThis case required, at the very least, debridement\\nand repair of the mitral-valve septum and replace-\\nment of the mitral valve. Destructive vegetations were\\nprobably present on the aortic valve as well as the mi-\\ntral valve. Ordinarily, the diagnostic procedure of\\nchoice would be transesophageal echocardiography,\\nfollowed by coronary arteriography in preparation for\\nemergency surgery. Alternatively, one could perform\\nonly transesophageal echocardiography preoperatively.\\nHowever, one must consider the moribund, septic\\ncondition of this patient and whether she would have\\nsurvived an attempt to replace both the mitral valve\\nand the aortic valve. In a patient in this condition,\\nthe risk of death associated with simultaneous re-\\nplacement of the aortic and mitral valves is approxi-\\nmately 10 to 15 percent; in this patient, the risk would\\nprobably have exceeded 75 percent.\\nIn summary, this patient had acute bacterial endo-\\ncarditis caused by Staph. aureus infection after septic\\nthrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein. Septic\\nperforation of the membranous portion of the inter-\\nventricular septum caused the formation of a fistula\\nfrom the left ventricular outflow tract to the right\\natrium. Vegetations were probably present on the\\naortic and mitral valves. Transesophageal echocardi-\\nography probably showed an aortic-ring abscess and\\npossibly showed additional destructive lesions, in\\nparticular, multiple abscesses or perforation of the\\nmitral-valve leaflet.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nAcute bacterial endocarditis, involving the mitral\\nand aortic valves, due to Staph. aureus infection,\\nwith a fistula between the left ventricle and the\\nright atrium.\\n\\nDR. DAVID E. GOSSMAN’S DIAGNOSES\\nAcute bacterial endocarditis, involving the mitral\\nand aortic valves, due to central-venous-cathe-\\nter infection with Staph. aureus. — Aortic-\\nring abscess and perforation of the mem-\\nbranous interventricular septum with a fistula\\nbetween the left ventricle and the right atrium.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. LIEL-COHEN: The diagnostic procedure was\\na transesophageal echocardiographic study (Fig. 2).\\nIn the four-chamber midesophageal view, there was\\na large, mobile echodensity on the anterior mitral-\\nvalve leaflet. At the base of the leaflet, there was a\\nfenestration, causing severe mitral regurgitation. In\\nthe short-axis and long-axis views, the aortic-valve\\ncusps appeared thickened and calcified, but there was\\nno evidence of a vegetation or an aortic-root abscess.\\nIn the views of the left ventricular outflow tract, a\\narrow jet passed through the membranous septum\\nterminating in the right atrium. There was moderate\\ntricuspid insufficiency but no evidence of vegeta-\\ntions on the tricuspid valve. A patent foramen ovale\\nwith a minimal left-to-right shunt was noted on color\\nDoppler studies.\\nDR. GUY REED: The cardiac surgeons discussed\\nemergency surgery with the patient’s family. Al-\\nthough surgery provided the only hope for survival,\\nit offered a very high risk of death and, if successful,\\nwould have entailed a long, difficult recovery. The\\nprognosis was poor because of progressive obtunda-\\ntion and renal failure, as well as refractory hypoten-\\nsion. The family thought that heroic measures would\\nbe inconsistent with the patient’s wishes, and she\\ndied shortly after the discussion.\\nDR. EIRA BROGI: At autopsy, the heart weighed\\n425 g. A fibrinopurulent exudate covered the epi-\\ncardium on the lateral and posterior surfaces of the\\nleft ventricle and surrounded the aortic root. Both\\natria were dilated. In the right atrium, below the fo-\\nramen ovale, there was a polypoid, ulcerated lesion,\\nmeasuring 0.6 cm by 0.6 cm by 0.3 cm (Fig. 3). The\\nulcer communicated with a fistula that entered the\\nleft atrium as well as the left ventricle.\\nA red, soft, friable vegetation occupied the non-\\ncoronary cusp of the aortic valve and the anterior\\nleaflet of the mitral valve (Fig. 4). The vegetation ex-\\ntended to the mitral-valve annulus and into the sub-\\njacent myocardium to form an abscess, which ex-\\ntended to the portion of the membranous septum\\nthat separates the right atrium and left ventricle, re-\\nsulting in the fistula (Fig. 5). The region of involve-\\nment by infection is important, because it is the site\\nof critical components of the cardiac conduction\\nsystem, including the atrioventricular node and the\\nproximal portion of the bundle of His (Fig. 6).\\nOn microscopical examination, the mitral-valve veg-\\netation consisted of a clot, necrotic debris, and colo-\\nnies of cocci (Fig. 7). Cultures of the vegetation\\nyielded Staph. aureus and enterococci. The myocar-\\ndium contained scattered foci of necrosis with in-\\nfiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Some\\nintramyocardial arterioles were occluded by throm-\\nboemboli. In addition to the cardiac findings, micro-\\nscopical abscesses were found in both kidneys. The\\nlung nodule that had remained unchanged radio-\\ngraphically for years was a well-circumscribed bron-\\nchial carcinoid, 5 cm by 3 cm by 2 cm.\\nA fistula between the right atrium and left ventricle\\nis exceedingly rare and can be congenital or ac-\\nquired. A congenital communication between the\\nleft ventricle and the right atrium accounts for less\\nthan 1 percent of all cases of congenital heart dis-\\nease. 18 In the case of a congenital fistula, the defect\\nlies in the uppermost portion of the muscular septum\\nand is associated with anomalies of the tricuspid\\nvalve. Even rarer is an acquired shunt between the left\\nventricle and the right atrium, which may be caused\\nby surgical trauma during the replacement of an aor-\\ntic valve19 or a mitral valve, 20-23 chest trauma, 24 ische-\\nmic heart disease, 25 or infective endocarditis. 26-28 In\\n60 to 90 percent of the cases associated with infec-\\ntive endocarditis, a congenital or acquired structural\\nabnormality of the heart was present.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Did you determine the\\ncause of the subarachnoid hemorrhage?\\nDR. BROGI: We found only cerebral contusions\\nthat were probably caused by the patient's fall.

Be concise and grounded.\\n\\n# PATIENT CASE\\nA 19-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of a febrile illness.\\nThe patient had been well until five weeks earlier, when a dry cough developed. Two weeks later, bouts of fever and chills began, and the cough became productive of greenish sputum. The patient had a weight loss of 9 kg. Two days before admission, radiographs of the chest (Fig. 1) showed patchy opacities in the left lower lobe that were consistent with the presence of pneumonia and left hilar, possibly right hilar, and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). Tuberculin was injected intradermally without the use of control antigens. Azithromycin was prescribed. The patient remained ill and was admitted to the hospital.\\nThe patient was a native of Honduras, where he had lived on a farm and cared for cattle before immigrating to Boston several weeks before admission. He had had \"malaria\" two years earlier, which had been treated with a six-day course of unknown medication. He passed a few loose stools during the week before admission. There was no history of use of intravenous drugs, receipt of blood products, sexual promiscuity, homosexual activity, or exposure to tuberculosis.\\nThe temperature was 38.6°C, the pulse was 100, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was cachectic and pale. Eczematoid lesions were present on the eyebrows and above the ears. The tuberculin skin test was negative at 48 hours. There was questionable thrush on the tongue. A few crackles were heard at the left lung base. A grade 2 systolic murmur was present. A nontender liver edge was palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. The spleen was not felt. A stool specimen was negative for occult blood.\\nThe urine was normal. A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was breathing ambient air, showed that the partial pressure of oxygen was 89 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 29 mm Hg, and the pH was 7.50. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). Repeated chest radiographs revealed no change.\\nThe patient was put in an isolation room. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture. Nystatin was given orally, and cefuroxime was administered intravenously. Doxycycline was added on the third hospital day; on the following day, clarithromycin was substituted for cefuroxime and doxycycline. The temperature rose daily to between 38.4 and 39.8°C. Physical examinations revealed that the lingual plaque was slowly regressing. Crackles persisted over the left lower lobe; no abnormal peripheral lymph nodes were detected. The patient had no diarrhea while in the hospital. No transfusions were given. On the second and third hospital days, laboratory studies were performed (Table 1).\\nOn the fourth hospital day a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax (Fig. 2), obtained after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material, showed right paratracheal, subcarinal, left hilar, aorticopulmonary, and prevascular lymph nodes that were 1.5 cm or smaller in diameter and numerous upper abdominal para-aortic lymph nodes that were 5 mm in diameter. Lung windows (Fig. 3) showed air-space opacities in the left lower lobe. Laboratory tests were performed on the fourth and subsequent hospital days.\\nBlood and urine cultures remained sterile. A culture of the lingual lesion yielded Candida albicans, and a sputum culture yielded normal respiratory tract flora. Microscopical examination of three stained sputum specimens showed no acid-fast bacilli; examination of thick and thin blood smears for plasmodium and babesia microorganisms was negative. Examination of three stool specimens showed no ova or parasites, and two stool cultures yielded no pathogenic microorganisms. An induced sputum specimen revealed no Pneumocystis carinii, acid-fast bacilli, or fungi; a culture yielded C. albicans. Serologic tests were performed (Table 3). A repeated tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative, 5 TU) and control skin tests with candida and mumps antigens were negative. A sucrose hemolysis test for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and a screening test for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency were negative.\\nOn the seventh hospital day, radiographs of the chest revealed normal lungs but persistent lymphadenopathy. An abdominopelvic CT scan, obtained after the oral and intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed several para-aortic lymph nodes, each less than 5 mm in diameter. Confluent air-space opacities were seen at the base of the left lung. Microscopical examination of an aspirated specimen of bone marrow showed no fungi or acid-fast bacilli. Flow-cytometric examination showed no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell population or an unusual T-cell population; the ratio of CD4 cells to CD8 cells was inverted.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. STUART M. LEVITZ: The key to the diagnosis in this case is an analysis of the clinical and laboratory findings in the context of two salient features. First, the patient had advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with a very low CD4 cell count, indicating severe immunocompromise and a risk of associated opportunistic infections. Second, the patient was a cattle farmer from Honduras and therefore may have been exposed to a variety of infectious agents.\\nThe patient\\'s anemia and leukopenia, which preceded the administration of medications, could have resulted from the HIV infection itself, but an infiltrative process in the marrow probably contributed to the cytopenia. The absence of fungi, acid-fast bacilli, and lymphoma cells on the aspirated specimen of bone marrow does not rule out an infiltrative process, especially with the results of cultures pending. On the second hospital day, the differential count included 11 percent eosinophils, but the absolute eosinophil count was less than 500 per cubic millimeter because of the leukopenia, and thus the patient did not have true eosinophilia. Moreover, eosinophilia in persons infected with HIV does not appear to be associated with systemic disorders such as parasitic infections or cancer.\\nAn elevation of the serum ferritin level is common in patients infected with HIV, and the level tends to continue to increase as the infection progresses clinically and the CD4 cell count drops, but an extreme elevation, such as this patient had, is unusual. The combination of the very high ferritin level and the markedly elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level in this case may be an important diagnostic clue.\\nThe differential diagnosis in this case includes infectious and noninfectious causes. One must be careful in applying Occam\\'s razor to cases of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), since the severe immunodeficiency often results in multiple concurrent pathologic processes. Moreover, some of the clinical and laboratory features of this case, such as fever, weight loss, anemia, and leukopenia, are common with advanced HIV infection, even in the absence of an identifiable coexisting condition.\\nIn considering the differential diagnosis, I shall begin with neoplastic disease. Patients with HIV-related lymphomas usually present with widespread extranodal involvement, fevers, drenching night sweats, and weight loss. The bone marrow is involved in about a third of cases of AIDS-related lymphomas, so a negative finding on bone marrow aspiration has limited diagnostic value. I cannot rule out lymphoma, although the pneumonia is evidence against the diagnosis. Also, in developing nations such as Honduras, where exposure to virulent bacteria is ubiquitous, malignant tumors are rarely the presenting manifestation of AIDS. The other common AIDS-related cancer is Kaposi\\'s sarcoma, which is associated with human herpesvirus 8. Although patients with Kaposi\\'s sarcoma occasionally present without cutaneous or oral manifestations, the disorder does not generally cause constitutional symptoms such as fever.\\nMany viruses, including parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis B and C viruses, can inhibit hematopoiesis, but they do not cause the clinical findings described in this case. Among parasitic diseases, visceral leishmaniasis due to Leishmania chagasi is seen in Honduras, and patients with this infection commonly present with anemia and leukopenia, but in this case, the presence of pneumonia and the absence of hepatosplenomegaly make the diagnosis unlikely. Other parasitic infections found in Honduras, including toxoplasmosis, do not fit the clinical picture in this case. The findings of toxoplasma and cytomegalovirus IgG antibodies in the blood indicate past exposure to these agents but do not indicate active disease.\\nThree zoonotic bacterial infections should be considered because of this patient\\'s occupation. Brucellosis due to Brucella abortus, a disease of cattle ranchers, often causes constitutional symptoms, anemia, and leukopenia, but pneumonia and thoracic lymphadenopathy are rare. Moreover, the cultures were negative in this case, and there was no response to antibiotics. Typhoid fever and nontyphoidal salmonellosis are improbable diagnoses since they rarely cause pneumonia and the cultures were negative. Rhodococcus equi, a pathogen in farm animals, causes disease in immunocompromised patients, especially those with AIDS. Pulmonary involvement is common, and lymphadenopathy is occasionally seen, but bone marrow involvement is unusual. Also, this organism should be easy to culture.\\nStudies of reactivity on skin testing have shown that Coccidioides immitis is endemic in the Comayagua Valley of Honduras but is rare elsewhere in the country. Clinically evident coccidioidomycosis, however, is uncommon in Honduras. Coccidioidomycosis is much more common in persons infected with HIV, who may present with fever, chills, pulmonary infiltrates, and lymphadenopathy, than in uninfected persons. I cannot rule out disseminated coccidioidomycosis in this case, but if it had been present, the organism would probably have grown in culture within the first week of the patient\\'s hospitalization. Also, the hematologic findings in this case are atypical of coccidioidomycosis. Cryptococcosis, another mycosis that is more common in persons with AIDS than in other persons, is an unlikely diagnosis in this case because of the negative cultures and the negative test for serum cryptococcal antigen.\\nMy two leading diagnoses are tuberculosis and histoplasmosis. Tuberculosis is a major public health problem in Honduras, with an estimated incidence rate of nearly 0.1 percent. Since the disease is becoming increasingly resistant to multiple drugs, it is important to obtain cultures and use a four-drug regimen for initial treatment. Nearly all cases of tuberculosis in industrialized countries are caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In developing countries, however, tuberculosis caused by M. bovis remains a problem. There are reports of sporadic cases in Honduras, where disease-control measures such as animal testing and pasteurization of milk are not used consistently. This patient had probably been exposed to M. bovis.\\nImmunosuppression caused by HIV infection is the greatest risk factor for active tuberculosis after infection with M. tuberculosis or M. bovis. Most patients with tuberculosis and advanced HIV infection have disseminated disease, and intrathoracic and intraabdominal lymphadenopathy is common. Although a typical pattern of reactivation with upper-lobe cavitary disease or miliary lesions may be seen on chest radiographs from patients with AIDS, many of them present with an atypical pattern, including lower-lobe infiltrates. Anemia and elevated ferritin levels are common in patients with bone marrow involvement. The tuberculin skin test is usually negative when the CD4 cell count is less than 50 per cubic millimeter. Thus, this patient\\'s clinical presentation is consistent with the presence of tuberculosis complicating AIDS. In patients with AIDS and tuberculosis, however, dissemination is common, and the mycobacterial burden tends to be very high. In this case, four sputum specimens, including one induced specimen, and a bone marrow aspirate were negative on acid-fast staining. These findings do not rule out the diagnosis of tuberculosis, especially with culture results still pending, but they weigh heavily against it.\\nThe probable diagnosis in this case is histoplasmosis. In the first published case of histoplasmosis, Darling reported “enormous numbers” of mostly intracellular organisms in the lungs, spleen, and bone marrow at autopsy in a man from Panama. Two points germane to this case can be gleaned from Darling\\'s observations. First, the premortem diagnosis had been miliary tuberculosis, suggesting the clinical overlap between histoplasmosis and tuberculosis, both of which are caused by organisms that have adapted to life as intracellular parasites of macrophages. Darling\\'s lesson was lost on many physicians in the Midwest, where thousands of people with histoplasmosis were mistakenly admitted to tuberculosis sanitariums. Second, histoplasmosis is endemic in Central America; in one survey, 40 percent of residents of Honduras had positive skin tests for histoplasmin.\\nHistoplasma capsulatum is a thermally dimorphic fungus. Its natural habitat is soil, where the organism exists in the mycelial phase at ambient temperatures. Thus, frequent exposure to soil in regions in which the fungus is endemic, as would be expected to occur in cattle farming, is a risk factor for histoplasmosis. Infection occurs when spores (conidia) are inhaled and deposited in the lungs. Conversion to the pathogenic yeast phase occurs when the spores are stimulated by the higher temperature of the body. In normal hosts, infection is usually asymptomatic or self-limited. Progressive disease, either restricted to the lungs or disseminated, develops in a small number of persons. In rare cases, an intense granulomatous inflammatory reaction to the fungus results in mediastinal fibrosis, pericarditis, or choroiditis.\\nT cells that stain for CD4 are critical to host defenses against histoplasmosis. Patients with AIDS who are from regions where histoplasmosis is endemic are markedly predisposed to disseminated infection. In the valleys of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, where histoplasmosis is endemic, disseminated infection occurs in about 5 percent of patients with AIDS.\\nI could not find data on the incidence of disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with AIDS in Honduras. In neighboring Guatemala, however, an incidence rate of 6.7 percent has been reported, with most cases occurring in farmers and construction workers. Among patients with AIDS, disseminated histoplasmosis usually occurs in those with CD4 cell counts below 75 per cubic millimeter. In contrast, perhaps because of the greater inherent pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis, infection with this pathogen occurs in HIV-infected persons with higher CD4 cell counts.\\nTherefore, this patient was at high risk for disseminated histoplasmosis. Although the clinical presentation of disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with AIDS is nonspecific, fever and weight loss are almost always present. In two large series of cases, about half the patients had radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. In this case, the focal pulmonary infiltrates, intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, and relatively rapid progression of the disease are consistent with the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. The lingual lesion could also have been due to histoplasmosis rather than thrush.\\nBone marrow involvement, which can lead to cytopenia similar to that seen in this patient, is common in disseminated histoplasmosis. In one large series, over 90 percent of patients had bone marrow cultures that were positive for H. capsulatum. The percentage of patients with H. capsulatum detected on microscopical examination of bone marrow specimens, however, was considerably lower. Extreme elevations of ferritin, as in this patient, have frequently been noted in patients with disseminated histoplasmosis and are often associated with the reactive hemophagocytic syndrome. Elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase have also been considered as a clue to the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with AIDS. Elevated ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase levels can also be found, however, in patients with AIDS who have other diseases — in particular, tuberculosis and lymphoma.\\nThe diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis complicating AIDS is generally easy to establish, because the organisms are numerous. Delays in diagnosis are most frequently a result of not considering the diagnosis and thus not performing the necessary diagnostic procedures. Like M. tuberculosis, H. capsulatum grows slowly, requiring up to four weeks for growth, so one should not wait for culture results before beginning therapy. In this patient, I would have obtained a urinary polysaccharide antigen test for H. capsulatum, which is highly sensitive and specific in patients with AIDS who have histoplasmosis; if the result is positive, a presumptive diagnosis can be made. Other diagnostic procedures that could have been performed in this case include bronchoscopy, examination of the peripheral-blood buffy coat, and biopsy of a lymph node or the lingual lesion. The frequent concurrence of histoplasmosis with other opportunistic infections, especially tuberculosis, has been noted. Thus, even if histoplasmosis is diagnosed, the effort to rule out tuberculosis should be continued.\\nIf the patient had been found to have disseminated histoplasmosis, I would have administered a course of amphotericin B followed by lifetime suppressive therapy with itraconazole. Because of the low CD4 cell counts and high HIV viral load, it would also be important to begin prophylaxis for P. carinii pneumonia as well as highly active antiretroviral therapy after the patient\\'s condition became stable. The antiretroviral therapy would offer the only reasonable hope for long-term survival, but if the patient returned to Honduras, he would probably be unable to obtain these medications.\\nDR. R. PAUL JOHNSON: The infectious-disease service was asked to see the patient on the seventh hospital day. We were concerned about the possibility of disseminated tuberculosis or histoplasmosis, but we also considered the possibility of lymphoma.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\n? Disseminated histoplasmosis or tuberculosis.\\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\\nDR. STUART M. LEVITZ\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nDisseminated histoplasmosis.\\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Two diagnostic results became available within a day of each other. A blood culture yielded H. capsulatum, and a test for urinary histoplasma antigen was positive. The patient had disseminated histoplasmosis and associated sepsis, which can develop from localized disease in either immunocompetent or immunosuppressed persons.\\nThe initial colony, cultured from the blood, was less than 1 mm in diameter when it was identified by a DNA probe. When the colony was replated on Sabouraud\\'s dextrose agar, it evolved into a mycelial phase, forming large cottony colonies (Fig. 4). Wet preparations of the mycelium have distinctive tuberculate chlamydospores (Fig. 5), the infective agents released into the air from organic material that serves as a culture medium in a contaminated environment. The nuclear material of the chlamydospores begins to clump and undergo internal trabeculation two days after experimental infection in mice. The chlamydospores quickly lose their projections and then rupture, releasing yeast. Within five days after infection, macrophages engorged with yeast become disseminated in alveoli. Within 6 days after infection, there is dissemination to the liver and spleen, and within 10 days, granulomatous inflammation similar to that seen in humans has developed in the lungs.\\nHistoplasmosis-associated sepsis can be manifested by the presence of organisms within mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood (Fig. 6) and in effusions. Darling observed the organisms in histiocytes (hence the term “histo-”), thought they were protozoan bodies resembling the plasmodium-like organism leishmania (hence “plasma”), and assumed that the clear space around each organism was a capsule (hence \"capsulatum\"). The reticuloendothelial system bears the brunt of the attack, and therefore the bone marrow, spleen, and liver, as well as the adrenal glands, are particularly likely to be involved. Disseminated histoplasmosis involves the adrenal gland in approximately 80 percent of cases, with subtotal necrosis and Addison\\'s disease in approximately 10 percent. This patient subsequently had adrenal insufficiency requiring corticosteroid therapy. The organisms appear intact within histiocytes, leading to their intracellular multiplication. Any organ can be involved. Death results from extensive disease in the lungs, heart, and brain. Endocarditis is the one complication in which the organisms thrive in an extracellular location, enmeshed in fibrin, and may be present in the form of hyphae in addition to yeast.\\nAlthough pulmonary histoplasmosis is generally benign, hematogenous spread occurs in many asymptomatic cases. Acute or progressive disseminated histoplasmosis is virtually always fatal if untreated, but the mortality rate in one series of immunocompetent patients treated with amphotericin B was only 7 percent. In a study of disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with AIDS, 11 of 14 patients had a response to treatment with amphotericin B and were discharged from the hospital. Bone marrow biopsy is the best diagnostic test in patients with disseminated disease.\\nDisseminated histoplasmosis in conjunction with HIV infection is particularly common among Hispanic persons in this country. In one study, 17 of 18 patients at risk for AIDS who had disseminated histoplasmosis were Hispanic; most of these patients had coexisting infections, including tuberculosis, and none had a previous diagnosis of AIDS.\\nDR. KATRINA KRETSINGER: After the diagnosis was made, the patient received amphotericin B intravenously. He did not tolerate it well; his creatinine level rose to 2.5 mg per deciliter (221 µmol per liter). After vigorous hydration, an S3 was heard on cardiac examination. An echocardiographic study revealed diffuse hypokinesis of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 27 percent — findings consistent with the presence of cardiomyopathy associated with AIDS. The patient\\'s symptoms improved after diuresis, transfusion of red cells, and initiation of triple-drug antiretroviral therapy. After he had received a cumulative dose of 700 mg of amphotericin B, itraconazole was substituted. He was discharged home in fair condition after a three-week hospitalization.\\nThree days after discharge, he returned with abdominal pain and nausea and had several tonic-clonic seizures that were controlled with lorazepam. Later, he returned to the emergency department with abdominal pain and nausea and had several witnessed tonic-clonic seizures that were controlled with lorazepam and subsequently with phenytoin. A cranial CT scan revealed enhancing lesions in the parietal lobes. Amphotericin B, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone were administered, and pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine was administered for several days. The results of extensive testing for pathogens in the cerebrospinal fluid were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed multiple unenhanced lesions involving the cortex, deep gray matter, and portions of the white matter — findings consistent with the presence of a hematogenously disseminated histoplasma infection. Antibiotics and antifungal medications for other organisms were discontinued. Examination and culture of a biopsy specimen of the brain showed no evidence of histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, or tuberculosis.\\nThe patient was finally discharged to another facility to complete a course of 1500 mg of amphotericin B administered intravenously, in addition to antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against seizures. An MRI scan obtained two weeks later showed progression of the brain lesions. He received 3600 mg of intravenously administered liposomal amphotericin B. At that point, his urinary histoplasma antigen level was normal, and his HIV RNA level had decreased to 592 copies per milliliter. Itraconazole was administered orally. The patient remained asymptomatic.\\nSubsequently, his viral load rose to 340,000 and then to 660,000 copies per milliliter, probably because of noncompliance with the treatment regimen. He then became lost to follow-up.\\nDR. MARK: How did you decide whether to treat the fungal infection or the HIV infection or both?\\nDR. JOHNSON: The amphotericin B and antiretroviral therapy did not interact. Our approach was to initiate amphotericin B therapy, wait for the fever to resolve, and then institute antiretroviral therapy while the patient was still hospitalized, but only after we had made sure that he had the social support required to continue with the antiretroviral therapy on an outpatient basis.\\nDR. ROBERT B. COLVIN: Is the urinary histoplasma antigen test sensitive enough that it can be used to monitor the response to therapy?\\nDR. ANGELA M. CALIENDO: The test is a semiquantitative enzyme immunoassay. Positive results are highly reproducible, but the number of antigen units in a single specimen can vary from one day to the next. To solve this problem, the original specimen can be retested in the same assay as the follow-up specimen. With this method, it is possible to monitor the response to therapy. An increase of more than 2 units in the antigen level during maintenance therapy is strongly suggestive of a relapse.\\nDR. MARK: Dr. Levitz, do you think that this patient\\'s myocardiopathy was due to histoplasmosis or HIV infection?\\nDR. LEVITZ: Histoplasma has been reported to invade the myocardium and cause cardiac dysfunction, but HIV can do the same.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "1.  **Information Gathering:**\n",
      "    *   **Key Signs/Symptoms:** Fever, weight loss, cough, lymphadenopathy (chest and hilar), skin lesions (eczematoid), possible thrush, anemia, leukopenia, and a history of malaria.\n",
      "    *   **Duration:** Symptoms have been present for 5 weeks, with a recent decline in health.\n",
      "    *   **Epidemiologic Context:** Native of Honduras, lived on a farm, exposure to cattle, immigration to Boston.\n",
      "    *   **Comorbidities/Medications:** History of malaria treated with unknown medication, azithromycin, and recent use of cefuroxime, doxycycline, and clarithromycin.\n",

      "    *   **Timing/Progression:** The initial symptoms (cough, fever) followed by weight loss and lymphadenopathy suggest a chronic or subacute process. The recent decline in health and the presence of opportunistic infections point towards immunosuppression.\n",
      "    *   **Age/Risk Factors:** The patient's age (19 years) and history of immigration from Honduras, where histoplasmosis is endemic, are significant risk factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
      "    *   **Defining Features:** The combination of fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and a history of exposure to a potential source of infection (cattle) is highly suggestive of disseminated histoplasmosis. The presence of thrush and possible myocardiopathy further supports the diagnosis.\n",
      "    *   **Discriminatory Features:** The negative tuberculin skin test, negative blood smears for malaria and babesiosis, and negative stool cultures for parasites make malaria and babesiosis less likely. The negative bone marrow biopsy makes lymphoma less likely, although it does not completely rule it out. The negative fungal cultures for other organisms (e.g., *Cryptococcus*, *Coccidioides*) make those diagnoses less likely.

      "{'query': 'A 19-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of a febrile illness.\\nThe patient had been well until five weeks earlier, when a dry cough developed. Two weeks later, bouts of fever and chills began, and the cough became productive of greenish sputum. The patient had a weight loss of 9 kg. Two days before admission, radiographs of the chest (Fig. 1) showed patchy opacities in the left lower lobe that were consistent with the presence of pneumonia and left hilar, possibly right hilar, and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). Tuberculin was injected intradermally without the use of control antigens. Azithromycin was prescribed. The patient remained ill and was admitted to the hospital.\\nThe patient was a native of Honduras, where he had lived on a farm and cared for cattle before immigrating to Boston several weeks before admission. He had had \"malaria\" two years earlier, which had been treated with a six-day course of unknown medication. He passed a few loose stools during the week before admission. There was no history of use of intravenous drugs, receipt of blood products, sexual promiscuity, homosexual activity, or exposure to tuberculosis.\\nThe temperature was 38.6°C, the pulse was 100, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was cachectic and pale. Eczematoid lesions were present on the eyebrows and above the ears. The tuberculin skin test was negative at 48 hours. There was questionable thrush on the tongue. A few crackles were heard at the left lung base. A grade 2 systolic murmur was present. A nontender liver edge was palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. The spleen was not felt. A stool specimen was negative for occult blood.\\nThe urine was normal. A specimen of arterial blood, drawn while the patient was breathing ambient air, showed that the partial pressure of oxygen was 89 mm Hg, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide was 29 mm Hg, and the pH was 7.50. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). Repeated chest radiographs revealed no change.\\nThe patient was put in an isolation room. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture. Nystatin was given orally, and cefuroxime was administered intravenously. Doxycycline was added on the third hospital day; on the following day, clarithromycin was substituted for cefuroxime and doxycycline. The temperature rose daily to between 38.4 and 39.8°C. Physical examinations revealed that the lingual plaque was slowly regressing. Crackles persisted over the left lower lobe; no abnormal peripheral lymph nodes were detected. The patient had no diarrhea while in the hospital. No transfusions were given. On the second and third hospital days, laboratory studies were performed (Table 1).\\nOn the fourth hospital day a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax (Fig. 2), obtained after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast material, showed right paratracheal, subcarinal, left hilar, aorticopulmonary, and prevascular lymph nodes that were 1.5 cm or smaller in diameter and numerous upper abdominal para-aortic lymph nodes that were 5 mm in diameter. Lung windows (Fig. 3) showed air-space opacities in the left lower lobe. Laboratory tests were performed on the fourth and subsequent hospital days.\\nBlood and urine cultures remained sterile. A culture of the lingual lesion yielded Candida albicans, and a sputum culture yielded normal respiratory tract flora. Microscopical examination of three stained sputum specimens showed no acid-fast bacilli; examination of thick and thin blood smears for plasmodium and babesia microorganisms was negative. Examination of three stool specimens showed no ova or parasites, and two stool cultures yielded no pathogenic microorganisms. An induced sputum specimen revealed no Pneumocystis carinii, acid-fast bacilli, or fungi; a culture yielded C. albicans. Serologic tests were performed (Table 3). A repeated tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative, 5 TU) and control skin tests with candida and mumps antigens were negative. A sucrose hemolysis test for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and a screening test for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency were negative.\\nOn the seventh hospital day, radiographs of the chest revealed normal lungs but persistent lymphadenopathy. An abdominopelvic CT scan, obtained after the oral and intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed several para-aortic lymph nodes, each less than 5 mm in diameter. Confluent air-space opacities were seen at the base of the left lung. Microscopical examination of an aspirated specimen of bone marrow showed no fungi or acid-fast bacilli. Flow-cytometric examination showed no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell population or an unusual T-cell population; the ratio of CD4 cells to CD8 cells was inverted.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. STUART M. LEVITZ: The key to the diagnosis in this case is an analysis of the clinical and laboratory findings in the context of two salient features. First, the patient had advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with a very low CD4 cell count, indicating severe immunocompromise and a risk of associated opportunistic infections. Second, the patient was a cattle farmer from Honduras and therefore may have been exposed to a variety of infectious agents.\\nThe patient\\'s anemia and leukopenia, which preceded the administration of medications, could have resulted from the HIV infection itself, but an infiltrative process in the marrow probably contributed to the cytopenia. The absence of fungi, acid-fast bacilli, and lymphoma cells on the aspirated specimen of bone marrow does not rule out an infiltrative process, especially with the results of cultures pending. On the second hospital day, the differential count included 11 percent eosinophils, but the absolute eosinophil count was less than 500 per cubic millimeter because of the leukopenia, and thus the patient did not have true eosinophilia. Moreover, eosinophilia in persons infected with HIV does not appear to be associated with systemic disorders such as parasitic infections or cancer.\\nAn elevation of the serum ferritin level is common in patients infected with HIV, and the level tends to continue to increase as the infection progresses clinically and the CD4 cell count drops, but an extreme elevation, such as this patient had, is unusual. The combination of the very high ferritin level and the markedly elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level in this case may be an important diagnostic clue.\\nThe differential diagnosis in this case includes infectious and noninfectious causes. One must be careful in applying Occam\\'s razor to cases of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), since the severe immunodeficiency often results in multiple concurrent pathologic processes. Moreover, some of the clinical and laboratory features of this case, such as fever, weight loss, anemia, and leukopenia, are common with advanced HIV infection, even in the absence of an identifiable coexisting condition.\\nIn considering the differential diagnosis, I shall begin with neoplastic disease. Patients with HIV-related lymphomas usually present with widespread extranodal involvement, fevers, drenching night sweats, and weight loss. The bone marrow is involved in about a third of cases of AIDS-related lymphomas, so a negative finding on bone marrow aspiration has limited diagnostic value. I cannot rule out lymphoma, although the pneumonia is evidence against the diagnosis. Also, in developing nations such as Honduras, where exposure to virulent bacteria is ubiquitous, malignant tumors are rarely the presenting manifestation of AIDS. The other common AIDS-related cancer is Kaposi\\'s sarcoma, which is associated with human herpesvirus 8. Although patients with Kaposi\\'s sarcoma occasionally present without cutaneous or oral manifestations, the disorder does not generally cause constitutional symptoms such as fever.\\nMany viruses, including parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis B and C viruses, can inhibit hematopoiesis, but they do not cause the clinical findings described in this case. Among parasitic diseases, visceral leishmaniasis due to Leishmania chagasi is seen in Honduras, and patients with this infection commonly present with anemia and leukopenia, but in this case, the presence of pneumonia and the absence of hepatosplenomegaly make the diagnosis unlikely. Other parasitic infections found in Honduras, including toxoplasmosis, do not fit the clinical picture in this case. The findings of toxoplasma and cytomegalovirus IgG antibodies in the blood indicate past exposure to these agents but do not indicate active disease.\\nThree zoonotic bacterial infections should be considered because of this patient\\'s occupation. Brucellosis due to Brucella abortus, a disease of cattle ranchers, often causes constitutional symptoms, anemia, and leukopenia, but pneumonia and thoracic lymphadenopathy are rare. Moreover, the cultures were negative in this case, and there was no response to antibiotics. Typhoid fever and nontyphoidal salmonellosis are improbable diagnoses since they rarely cause pneumonia and the cultures were negative. Rhodococcus equi, a pathogen in farm animals, causes disease in immunocompromised patients, especially those with AIDS. Pulmonary involvement is common, and lymphadenopathy is occasionally seen, but bone marrow involvement is unusual. Also, this organism should be easy to culture.\\nStudies of reactivity on skin testing have shown that Coccidioides immitis is endemic in the Comayagua Valley of Honduras but is rare elsewhere in the country. Clinically evident coccidioidomycosis, however, is uncommon in Honduras. Coccidioidomycosis is much more common in persons infected with HIV, who may present with fever, chills, pulmonary infiltrates, and lymphadenopathy, than in uninfected persons. I cannot rule out disseminated coccidioidomycosis in this case, but if it had been present, the organism would probably have grown in culture within the first week of the patient\\'s hospitalization. Also, the hematologic findings in this case are atypical of coccidioidomycosis. Cryptococcosis, another mycosis that is more common in persons with AIDS than in other persons, is an unlikely diagnosis in this case because of the negative cultures and the negative test for serum cryptococcal antigen.\\nMy two leading diagnoses are tuberculosis and histoplasmosis. Tuberculosis is a major public health problem in Honduras, with an estimated incidence rate of nearly 0.1 percent. Since the disease is becoming increasingly resistant to multiple drugs, it is important to obtain cultures and use a four-drug regimen for initial treatment. Nearly all cases of tuberculosis in industrialized countries are caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In developing countries, however, tuberculosis caused by M. bovis remains a problem. There are reports of sporadic cases in Honduras, where disease-control measures such as animal testing and pasteurization of milk are not used consistently. This patient had probably been exposed to M. bovis.\\nImmunosuppression caused by HIV infection is the greatest risk factor for active tuberculosis after infection with M. tuberculosis or M. bovis. Most patients with tuberculosis and advanced HIV infection have disseminated disease, and intrathoracic and intraabdominal lymphadenopathy is common. Although a typical pattern of reactivation with upper-lobe cavitary disease or miliary lesions may be seen on chest radiographs from patients with AIDS, many of them present with an atypical pattern, including lower-lobe infiltrates. Anemia and elevated ferritin levels are common in patients with bone marrow involvement. The tuberculin skin test is usually negative when the CD4 cell count is less than 50 per cubic millimeter. Thus, this patient\\'s clinical presentation is consistent with the presence of tuberculosis complicating AIDS. In patients with AIDS and tuberculosis, however, dissemination is common, and the mycobacterial burden tends to be very high. In this case, four sputum specimens, including one induced specimen, and a bone marrow aspirate were negative on acid-fast staining. These findings do not rule out the diagnosis of tuberculosis, especially with culture results still pending, but they weigh heavily against it.\\nThe probable diagnosis in this case is histoplasmosis. In the first published case of histoplasmosis, Darling reported “enormous numbers” of mostly intracellular organisms in the lungs, spleen, and bone marrow at autopsy in a man from Panama. Two points germane to this case can be gleaned from Darling\\'s observations. First, the premortem diagnosis had been miliary tuberculosis, suggesting the clinical overlap between histoplasmosis and tuberculosis, both of which are caused by organisms that have adapted to life as intracellular parasites of macrophages. Darling\\'s lesson was lost on many physicians in the Midwest, where thousands of people with histoplasmosis were mistakenly admitted to tuberculosis sanitariums. Second, histoplasmosis is endemic in Central America; in one survey, 40 percent of residents of Honduras had positive skin tests for histoplasmin.\\nHistoplasma capsulatum is a thermally dimorphic fungus. Its natural habitat is soil, where the organism exists in the mycelial phase at ambient temperatures. Thus, frequent exposure to soil in regions in which the fungus is endemic, as would be expected to occur in cattle farming, is a risk factor for histoplasmosis. Infection occurs when spores (conidia) are inhaled and deposited in the lungs. Conversion to the pathogenic yeast phase occurs when the spores are stimulated by the higher temperature of the body. In normal hosts, infection is usually asymptomatic or self-limited. Progressive disease, either restricted to the lungs or disseminated, develops in a small number of persons. In rare cases, an intense granulomatous inflammatory reaction to the fungus results in mediastinal fibrosis, pericarditis, or choroiditis.\\nT cells that stain for CD4 are critical to host defenses against histoplasmosis. Patients with AIDS who are from regions where histoplasmosis is endemic are markedly predisposed to disseminated infection. In the valleys of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, where histoplasmosis is endemic, disseminated infection occurs in about 5 percent of patients with AIDS.\\nI could not find data on the incidence of disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with AIDS in Honduras. In neighboring Guatemala, however, an incidence rate of 6.7 percent has been reported, with most cases occurring in farmers and construction workers. Among patients with AIDS, disseminated histoplasmosis usually occurs in those with CD4 cell counts below 75 per cubic millimeter. In contrast, perhaps because of the greater inherent pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis, infection with this pathogen occurs in HIV-infected persons with higher CD4 cell counts.\\nTherefore, this patient was at high risk for disseminated histoplasmosis. Although the clinical presentation of disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with AIDS is nonspecific, fever and weight loss are almost always present. In two large series of cases, about half the patients had radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. In this case, the focal pulmonary infiltrates, intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, and relatively rapid progression of the disease are consistent with the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. The lingual lesion could also have been due to histoplasmosis rather than thrush.\\nBone marrow involvement, which can lead to cytopenia similar to that seen in this patient, is common in disseminated histoplasmosis. In one large series, over 90 percent of patients had bone marrow cultures that were positive for H. capsulatum. The percentage of patients with H. capsulatum detected on microscopical examination of bone marrow specimens, however, was considerably lower. Extreme elevations of ferritin, as in this patient, have frequently been noted in patients with disseminated histoplasmosis and are often associated with the reactive hemophagocytic syndrome. Elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase have also been considered as a clue to the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with AIDS. Elevated ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase levels can also be found, however, in patients with AIDS who have other diseases — in particular, tuberculosis and lymphoma.\\nThe diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis complicating AIDS is generally easy to establish, because the organisms are numerous. Delays in diagnosis are most frequently a result of not considering the diagnosis and thus not performing the necessary diagnostic procedures. Like M. tuberculosis, H. capsulatum grows slowly, requiring up to four weeks for growth, so one should not wait for culture results before beginning therapy. In this patient, I would have obtained a urinary polysaccharide antigen test for H. capsulatum, which is highly sensitive and specific in patients with AIDS who have histoplasmosis; if the result is positive, a presumptive diagnosis can be made. Other diagnostic procedures that could have been performed in this case include bronchoscopy, examination of the peripheral-blood buffy coat, and biopsy of a lymph node or the lingual lesion. The frequent concurrence of histoplasmosis with other opportunistic infections, especially tuberculosis, has been noted. Thus, even if histoplasmosis is diagnosed, the effort to rule out tuberculosis should be continued.\\nIf the patient had been found to have disseminated histoplasmosis, I would have administered a course of amphotericin B followed by lifetime suppressive therapy with itraconazole. Because of the low CD4 cell counts and high HIV viral load, it would also be important to begin prophylaxis for P. carinii pneumonia as well as highly active antiretroviral therapy after the patient\\'s condition became stable. The antiretroviral therapy would offer the only reasonable hope for long-term survival, but if the patient returned to Honduras, he would probably be unable to obtain these medications.\\nDR. R. PAUL JOHNSON: The infectious-disease service was asked to see the patient on the seventh hospital day. We were concerned about the possibility of disseminated tuberculosis or histoplasmosis, but we also considered the possibility of lymphoma.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\n? Disseminated histoplasmosis or tuberculosis.\\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\\nDR. STUART M. LEVITZ\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nDisseminated histoplasmosis.\\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Two diagnostic results became available within a day of each other. A blood culture yielded H. capsulatum, and a test for urinary histoplasma antigen was positive. The patient had disseminated histoplasmosis and associated sepsis, which can develop from localized disease in either immunocompetent or immunosuppressed persons.\\nThe initial colony, cultured from the blood, was less than 1 mm in diameter when it was identified by a DNA probe. When the colony was replated on Sabouraud\\'s dextrose agar, it evolved into a mycelial phase, forming large cottony colonies (Fig. 4). Wet preparations of the mycelium have distinctive tuberculate chlamydospores (Fig. 5), the infective agents released into the air from organic material that serves as a culture medium in a contaminated environment. The nuclear material of the chlamydospores begins to clump and undergo internal trabeculation two days after experimental infection in mice. The chlamydospores quickly lose their projections and then rupture, releasing yeast. Within five days after infection, macrophages engorged with yeast become disseminated in alveoli. Within 6 days after infection, there is dissemination to the liver and spleen, and within 10 days, granulomatous inflammation similar to that seen in humans has developed in the lungs.\\nHistoplasmosis-associated sepsis can be manifested by the presence of organisms within mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood (Fig. 6) and in effusions. Darling observed the organisms in histiocytes (hence the term “histo-”), thought they were protozoan bodies resembling the plasmodium-like organism leishmania (hence “plasma”), and assumed that the clear space around each organism was a capsule (hence \"capsulatum\"). The reticuloendothelial system bears the brunt of the attack, and therefore the bone marrow, spleen, and liver, as well as the adrenal glands, are particularly likely to be involved. Disseminated histoplasmosis involves the adrenal gland in approximately 80 percent of cases, with subtotal necrosis and Addison\\'s disease in approximately 10 percent. This patient subsequently had adrenal insufficiency requiring corticosteroid therapy. The organisms appear intact within histiocytes, leading to their intracellular multiplication. Any organ can be involved. Death results from extensive disease in the lungs, heart, and brain. Endocarditis is the one complication in which the organisms thrive in an extracellular location, enmeshed in fibrin, and may be present in the form of hyphae in addition to yeast.\\nAlthough pulmonary histoplasmosis is generally benign, hematogenous spread occurs in many asymptomatic cases. Acute or progressive disseminated histoplasmosis is virtually always fatal if untreated, but the mortality rate in one series of immunocompetent patients treated with amphotericin B was only 7 percent. In a study of disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with AIDS, 11 of 14 patients had a response to treatment with amphotericin B and were discharged from the hospital. Bone marrow biopsy is the best diagnostic test in patients with disseminated disease.\\nDisseminated histoplasmosis in conjunction with HIV infection is particularly common among Hispanic persons in this country. In one study, 17 of 18 patients at risk for AIDS who had disseminated histoplasmosis were Hispanic; most of these patients had coexisting infections, including tuberculosis, and none had a previous diagnosis of AIDS.\\nDR. KATRINA KRETSINGER: After the diagnosis was made, the patient received amphotericin B intravenously. He did not tolerate it well; his creatinine level rose to 2.5 mg per deciliter (221 µmol per liter). After vigorous hydration, an S3 was heard on cardiac examination. An echocardiographic study revealed diffuse hypokinesis of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 27 percent — findings consistent with the presence of cardiomyopathy associated with AIDS. The patient\\'s symptoms improved after diuresis, transfusion of red cells, and initiation of triple-drug antiretroviral therapy. After he had received a cumulative dose of 700 mg of amphotericin B, itraconazole was substituted. He was discharged home in fair condition after a three-week hospitalization.\\nThree days after discharge, he returned with abdominal pain and nausea and had several tonic-clonic seizures that were controlled with lorazepam. Later, he returned to the emergency department with abdominal pain and nausea and had several witnessed tonic-clonic seizures that were controlled with lorazepam and subsequently with phenytoin. A cranial CT scan revealed enhancing lesions in the parietal lobes. Amphotericin B, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone were administered, and pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine was administered for several days. The results of extensive testing for pathogens in the cerebrospinal fluid were negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed multiple unenhanced lesions involving the cortex, deep gray matter, and portions of the white matter — findings consistent with the presence of a hematogenously disseminated histoplasma infection. Antibiotics and antifungal medications for other organisms were discontinued. Examination and culture of a biopsy specimen of the brain showed no evidence of histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, or tuberculosis.\\nThe patient was finally discharged to another facility to complete a course of 1500 mg of amphotericin B administered intravenously, in addition to antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against seizures. An MRI scan obtained two weeks later showed progression of the brain lesions. He received 3600 mg of intravenously administered liposomal amphotericin B. At that point, his urinary histoplasma antigen level was normal, and his HIV RNA level had decreased to 592 copies per milliliter. Itraconazole was administered orally. The patient remained asymptomatic.\\nSubsequently, his viral load rose to 340,000 and then to 660,000 copies per milliliter, probably because of noncompliance with the treatment regimen. He then became lost to follow-up.\\nDR. MARK: How did you decide whether to treat the fungal infection or the HIV infection or both?\\nDR. JOHNSON: The amphotericin B and antiretroviral therapy did not interact. Our approach was to initiate amphotericin B therapy, wait for the fever to resolve, and then institute antiretroviral therapy while the patient was still hospitalized, but only after we had made sure that he had the social support required to continue with the antiretroviral therapy on an outpatient basis.\\nDR. ROBERT B. COLVIN: Is the urinary histoplasma antigen test sensitive enough that it can be used to monitor the response to therapy?\\nDR. ANGELA M. CALIENDO: The test is a semiquantitative enzyme immunoassay. Positive results are highly reproducible, but the number of antigen units in a single specimen can vary from one day to the next. To solve this problem, the original specimen can be retested in the same assay as the follow-up specimen. With this method, it is possible to monitor the response to therapy. An increase of more than 2 units in the antigen level during maintenance therapy is strongly suggestive of a relapse.\\nDR. MARK: Dr. Levitz, do you think that this patient\\'s myocardiopathy was due to histoplasmosis or HIV infection?\\nDR. LEVITZ: Histoplasma has been reported to invade the myocardium and cause cardiac dysfunction, but HIV can do the same.', 'images_used': [], 'answer': 'Based on the patient\\'s presentation, history, and investigations, the most likely diagnosis is **Disseminated Histoplasmosis** complicated by **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)**.\\n\\nHere\\'s the reasoning:\\n\\n1.  **Information Gathering:**\\n    *   **Key Signs/Symptoms:** Fever, weight loss, cough, lymphadenopathy (chest and hilar), skin lesions (eczematoid), possible thrush, anemia, leukopenia, and a history of malaria.\\n    *   **Duration:** Symptoms have been present for 5 weeks, with a recent decline in health.\\n    *   **Epidemiologic Context:** Native of Honduras, lived on a farm, exposure to cattle, immigration to Boston.\\n    *   **Comorbidities/Medications:** History of malaria treated with unknown medication, azithromycin, and recent use of cefuroxime, doxycycline, and clarithromycin.\\n    *   **Red-Flag Features:** Weight loss, lymphadenopathy, possible thrush, and the patient\\'s cachectic appearance.\\n\\n2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\\n    *   **Systemic:** Disseminated infection (histoplasmosis, tuberculosis, lymphoma), opportunistic infections (Pneumocystis pneumonia, CMV, toxoplasmosis), HIV-related complications (myocarditis, neurological involvement).\\n    *   **Timing/Progression:** The initial symptoms (cough, fever) followed by weight loss and lymphadenopathy suggest a chronic or subacute process.

Be concise and grounded.\\n\\n# PATIENT CASE\\nA 50-year-old woman was admitted to the hospi-\\ntal because of diarrhea that had developed during\\nradiation treatment.\\nThe patient had been well until 15 years earlier,\\nwhen a stage 1A, Clark level II malignant melanoma\\n(Fig. 1), 0.45 mm in thickness, was excised from her\\nback. Six months before admission, a mammograph-\\nic examination showed a left axillary mass. A biopsy\\nof the mass performed 21 weeks before admission\\nshowed metastatic melanoma. Ten days later, a com-\\nputed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest showed\\nmultiple enlarged axillary lymph nodes and minimal\\npericardial fluid or thickening. An abdominal CT\\nscan (Fig. 2) showed a right adrenal mass, 2 cm in\\ndiameter, and a lesion in the right hepatic lobe, 1 cm\\nin diameter — findings suggesting the presence of a\\nhemangioma.\\nA left axillary lymph-node dissection was per-\\nformed 162 weeks before admission. Microscopical\\nexamination of the specimen showed metastatic mel-\\nanoma in 40 lymph nodes at levels I and II and in\\n24 lymph nodes at level III. A drain was left in the\\nincision for 10 days. Soon after its removal, fever de-\\nveloped; cephalexin was administered, with resolu-\\ntion of the fever.\\nExamination of the patient at this hospital 14\\nweeks before admission showed no evidence of tu-\\nmor. The results of hematologic and blood chemical\\ntests performed at this time and subsequently are\\nshown in Tables 1 and 2. Eleven weeks before ad-\\nmission, radiation treatment (total dose, 60 Gy) was\\nadministered through a port on the left side of the\\nupper chest over a six-week period. Diarrhea devel-\\noped early in this period and gradually increased,\\nwith the passage of 10 to 15 stools daily by the end of the course of radiation treatment. The diarrhea\\nwas accompanied by occasional fecal incontinence,\\nheartburn, nausea, and vomiting. There was no ab-\\ndominal pain or hematochezia. Cephalexin was dis-\\ncontinued, and metronidazole was prescribed, with-\\nout improvement.\\nTwo weeks before admission, radiographs of the\\nchest showed an infiltrate or early atelectasis in the\\nleft upper lobe and blunting of the right costo-\\nphrenic sulcus. A stool culture yielded no pathogens.\\nMicroscopical examination of two stool specimens\\nshowed no ova or parasites, and a test for Clostridi-\\num difficile toxin was negative. Six days before ad-\\nmission, a CT scan of the abdomen (Fig. 3 and 4),\\nobtained after the administration of contrast materi-\\nal, showed mesenteric lymphadenopathy and the right\\nadrenal mass. The small bowel was markedly and dif-\\nfusely thickened, without evidence of obstruction.\\nThe large bowel appeared normal. Subsequently, the\\npatient became dyspneic and very weak and was un-\\nable to walk without assistance. She was admitted to\\nthe hospital.\\nThe patient had a clerical occupation. She had a\\nhistory of hypertension, depression, and marked obe-\\nsity, with a weight loss of nearly 70 kg on a diet dur-\\ning the 18 months before admission and an addi-\\ntional loss of 4 to 5 kg during the week before\\nadmission, despite the development of peripheral ede-\\nma. Her medications consisted of amitriptyline, dox-\\nazosin, loperamide, and ibuprofen. A younger sister\\nhad been treated for malignant melanoma.\\nThe temperature was 36.4°C, the pulse was 92,\\nand the respirations were 16. The blood pressure\\nwas 75/40 mm Hg.\\nPhysical examination showed mild tenderness in\\nthe epigastrium and right upper quadrant, without masses, organomegaly, guarding, or rebound tender-\\nness. There was peripheral edema (+++). Rectal ex-\\namination showed no abnormalities. A brown-liquid\\nstool specimen was positive (+) for occult blood.\\nThe urine was positive for protein (+) and biliru-\\nbin (+). The sediment contained no red cells, 0 to\\n2 white cells, and moderate numbers of bacteria per\\nhigh-power field. Radiographs of the chest showed\\nno change in the infiltrate. A cardiac ultrasonograph-\\nic study showed an echo-free space between the vis-\\nceral and parietal pericardium, a finding consistent\\nwith the presence of a minimal effusion, pericardial\\nfat, or both. Fluids and electrolytes were administered.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. SAPNA SYNGAL*: May we review the radio-\\nlogic studies?\\nDR. MARY JANE O\\'NEILL: The first CT image\\n(Fig. 2) shows a mass, 2 cm in diameter, in the right\\nadrenal gland. Because the study was performed af-\\nter the administration of contrast material, it cannot\\nbe determined whether the mass is an adenoma or\\nmetastatic tumor. Images at lower levels (Fig. 3 and\\n4) reveal marked thickening of multiple loops of\\nsmall bowel and extensive mesenteric lymph-node\\nenlargement.\\nDR. SYNGAL: The diagnostic tests available for pa-\\ntients presenting with diarrhea include studies of fe-\\ncal fat, white cells, and osmolarity; breath tests that\\ndocument malabsorption; and endoscopic studies.\\nUsually, however, one can focus on the salient fea-\\ntures of the history, physical examination, and screen-\\ning laboratory tests to direct the diagnostic approach\\nto specific diseases.\\nThe most striking feature of this patient\\'s illness is\\nthe relatively rapid development of hypoproteinemia\\nwith severe peripheral edema. The interpretation of\\nthis feature is complicated by the history of metastat-\\nic melanoma. Hypoalbuminemia is one of the most\\nfrequent nonspecific abnormalities associated with\\ncancer, and it is usually due to decreased synthesis of\\nalbumin.¹ Although this patient had lost a consider-\\nable amount of weight on a diet, her presentation\\nwas not characteristic of malnutrition, and most of\\nthe weight loss antedated the onset of her symptoms\\nby at least a year. Also, she had a relatively low level\\nof proteinuria, which would not be expected to lead\\nto severe hypoproteinemia. The rapidity and the\\nmagnitude of the reduction in the protein level as-\\nsociated with severe diarrhea suggest that enteric\\nloss is the most likely explanation and that the pa-\\ntient has protein-losing enteropathy. Objective evi-\\ndence of enteric loss of protein can be obtained most easily by the demonstration of an increase in\\nfecal alpha₁-antitrypsin clearance,² which was not done\\nin this case. The diagnosis of protein-losing enterop-\\nathy can often be inferred clinically, however, when\\ngastrointestinal symptoms are associated with hypo-\\nproteinemia in the absence of malnutrition, in the\\nabsence of renal disease with proteinuria, and in the\\nabsence of hepatic disease that results in decreased\\nprotein synthesis.\\nExcessive loss of plasma protein into the gut may\\nbe caused by lymphatic disorders or by mucosal loss\\nat any site in the gastrointestinal tract due to ulcer-\\native or nonulcerative disease.\\nIntestinal lymphangiectasia may be congenital or\\nmay be caused by diseases that disrupt lymphatic\\ndrainage. The congenital form generally presents by\\nthe age of 30 years, with edema, diarrhea, hypopro-\\nteinemia, and lymphocytopenia, unlike the clinical\\npresentation in this case. Secondary intestinal lym-\\nphangiectasia can result from trauma or obstruction\\nof lymphatic flow within any intestinal layer. Cardiac\\ndisorders with right-sided heart failure, such as con-\\nstrictive pericarditis and tricuspid insufficiency, can\\ncause secondary intestinal lymphangiectasia¹; diseas-\\nes resulting in mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphad-\\nenopathy, including sarcoidosis, Whipple\\'s disease,5\\nand lymphoma, can also lead to a protein-losing en-\\nteropathy.\\nCertain other causes of protein-losing enteropa-\\nthy can be ruled out in this case. The radiologic\\nstudies indicating small-bowel involvement are strong\\nevidence against both Ménétrier\\'s disease and ul-\\ncerative colitis. Systemic diseases such as systemic lu-\\npus erythematosus and amyloidosis8-10 could explain\\nsome, but not all, of the symptoms and findings in\\nthis case.\\nAmong the disorders that primarily affect the\\nsmall intestine and can be associated with protein-\\nlosing enteropathy is eosinophilic gastroenteropathy,\\na category that includes a spectrum of diseases char-\\nacterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the gastroin-\\ntestinal tract. The association of eosinophilic gastro-\\nenteropathy with ingestion of specific foods is less\\nfrequent in adults than in infants. Patients who have\\neosinophilic gastroenteropathy with predominantly\\nmucosal or submucosal involvement or both may\\npresent with diarrhea and weight loss associated with\\nsmall-bowel thickening on radiologic studies. How-\\never, other common features of eosinophilic gastro-\\nenteropathy, such as peripheral eosinophilia and a\\nhistory of atopy, were not present in this case, and\\nthis disorder would not explain the rapidly rising\\nlevel of lactate dehydrogenase and the adrenal mass.\\nMany acute and chronic infections of the gastro-\\nintestinal tract have been associated with protein-\\nlosing enteropathy, including infection with C. dif-\\nficile,11 giardiasis,12 schistosomiasis,13 viral enteritis,14\\nand bacterial overgrowth,15 as well as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Cultures for\\nenteric pathogens, stool examination for ova and\\nparasites, and a test for C. difficile toxin were nega-\\ntive, however, in this case. There was no eosinophil-\\nia, which is a characteristic feature of parasitic infec-\\ntion, and metronidazole therapy would be expected\\nto lead to improvement if the patient had C. difficile\\ninfection or bacterial overgrowth in the bowel. The\\npatient had no risk factors for infection with the hu-\\nman immunodeficiency virus, and there is no indica-\\ntion that she had AIDS.\\nWhipple\\'s disease, a rare systemic illness that can\\naffect virtually any organ system in the body, should\\nbe considered. 16 Small-intestinal involvement is com-\\nmon and can lead to thickening of the wall similar\\nto that seen in this patient. Many of the clinical find-\\nings in this case, including lymphadenopathy, weight\\nloss, diarrhea, and pleural and pericardial effusions,\\nmay be present in patients with Whipple\\'s disease.\\nThe diagnosis can be made on the basis of peroral\\nintestinal biopsy with the demonstration of macro-\\nphages by periodic acid-Schiff staining. Whipple\\'s\\ndisease is far more common in men than in women,\\nhowever, and it would not explain the adrenal mass\\nand rapidly rising level of lactate dehydrogenase in\\nthis patient.\\nAlthough antibiotic-associated diarrhea is com-\\nmon and this patient was treated with cephalexin,\\nthe diarrhea is rarely as severe as in this case and it\\ngenerally does not persist as long after the discon-\\ntinuation of the antibiotic. Of the medications pre-\\nscribed in this case, the one that should be consid-\\nered most strongly as a cause of protein loss is\\nibuprofen. The gastropathy associated with nonste-\\nroidal antiinflammatory drugs is well known,17 but\\ntheir effects on the small and large intestine have\\nonly recently been fully recognized. Inflammation of\\nthe small intestine occurs in up to 65 percent of pa-\\ntients receiving these drugs over a long period and\\ncan result in bleeding, protein loss, or intestinal\\nstrictures. 18 However, enteropathy due to nonsteroi-\\ndal antiinflammatory drugs would not explain many\\nof the other features of this patient\\'s illness.\\nIn patients with celiac sprue, gluten damages the\\nsmall-bowel mucosa. Symptoms may begin at any\\ntime of life. The disease is characterized by malab-\\nsorption of nutrients and improvement of symptoms\\nafter the elimination of gluten from the diet.19 Pa-\\ntients with celiac sprue are at increased risk for\\ncancer, 20 including small-intestinal lymphoma and\\nadenocarcinoma, which can lead to the lymphade-\\nnopathy and small-bowel thickening seen on the CT\\nscan in this case. In the absence of superimposed\\ncancer, however, celiac sprue does not explain all the\\nclinical features of this case. Protein-losing enterop-\\nathy is a complication of many types of cancer, in-\\ncluding lymphoma, 21 carcinoid tumor with the car-\\ncinoid syndrome, Kaposi\\'s sarcoma, 22 leukemia, 23 and carcinomas, as well as one or more polyps of the gas-\\ntrointestinal tract.¹\\nPatients with malignant melanoma may be at in-\\ncreased risk for secondary cancers associated with fa-\\nmilial cancer syndromes, such as the Li-Fraumeni\\nsyndrome,24 hereditary retinoblastoma,25 and famil-\\nial melanoma.26 However, a hereditary cancer syn-\\ndrome is not necessarily implicated in this case. The\\ndevelopment of melanoma at a relatively young age\\nin both the patient and her sister could have result-\\ned from nongenetic risk factors, such as exposure to\\nthe sun.\\nApart from hereditary factors, patients with mela-\\nnoma may be at increased risk for secondary cancers,\\nincluding other skin cancers and nondermatologic\\ntumors such as lymphoma.27 The small intestine may\\nbe primarily or secondarily involved by lymphoma.\\nImmunoproliferative small-intestinal disease is the\\nmost common form of primary lymphoma of the\\nsmall bowel in the Middle East and Africa. It is char-\\nacterized by diffuse small-bowel involvement and of-\\nten by the triad of abdominal pain, malabsorption,\\nand clubbing at presentation. In developed coun-\\ntries, primary intestinal lymphomas are characterized\\nby diffuse infiltrates or nodular masses; involvement\\nof the mesenteric lymph nodes is common. Many of\\nthe features of this case are consistent with the pres-\\nence of an intestinal lymphoma, including the clini-\\ncal presentation of diarrhea and protein-losing enter-\\nopathy, the radiologic appearance of the small bowel,\\nand the rising lactate dehydrogenase level. The one\\nfeature that is difficult to attribute to lymphoma, how-\\never, is the presence of the adrenal mass.\\nAdrenal masses are seen on 0.6 percent of abdom-\\ninal CT scans. 28 Most of these masses are adenomas.\\nAlthough lesions greater than 5 cm in diameter are\\nmore likely to be malignant than smaller lesions, can-\\ncer cannot be ruled out on the basis of the size of\\nthe mass. The patient under discussion does not have\\nthe clinical features associated with a functioning\\nadrenocortical tumor. Pheochromocytomas can se-\\ncrete vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, causing diar-\\nrhea, but it is usually severe and watery, with hypo-\\nkalemia and acidosis. 29 This patient did not have\\nelectrolyte abnormalities, and the hypoproteinemia is\\nnot consistent with the presence of secretory diarrhea.\\nA classic principle of internal medicine is to at-\\ntempt, whenever possible, to make one diagnosis\\nthat explains all the features of a patient\\'s illness, and\\nin this case, malignant melanoma is such a diagnosis.\\nIt accounts for only 1 to 3 percent of all cancers but\\nfor over two thirds of all deaths related to skin can-\\ncer. Several features of this patient\\'s illness suggest\\nthe presence of widespread, rapidly progressive met-\\nastatic disease. The adrenal gland is a common site\\nof metastasis in patients with malignant melanoma,\\nand mesenteric lymphadenopathy is also consistent\\nwith the presence of metastatic disease. In addition, a high lactate dehydrogenase level is frequently asso-\\nciated with malignant melanoma.\\nMalignant melanoma is the most common tumor\\nthat metastasizes to the gastrointestinal tract,30 spread-\\ning to it by direct extension or by the lymphatics.\\nAutopsy studies have shown gastrointestinal metas-\\ntases in 50 to 60 percent of patients with melano-\\nma,31 but most metastases are not diagnosed before\\ndeath. 30 The small bowel is the most frequent intes-\\ntinal site of metastasis, and in one autopsy series, 58\\npercent of patients with gastrointestinal metastatic\\nmelanoma had small-bowel involvement.31\\nBowel metastases may appear radiologically as pol-\\nypoid mucosal lesions, submucosal nodules, diffuse\\ninfiltration with thickening of the intestinal wall, or\\nserosal implants.32 The most common radiologic\\nappearance is that of a \"bull\\'s eye,\" which is seen\\nwhen barium occupies a central ulcer in a metastatic\\nnodule.33\\nMetastatic melanoma can cause a wide variety of\\nnonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms, including vom-\\niting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Bow-\\nel obstruction due to intussusception is a common\\nclinical presentation of gastrointestinal metastasis;\\nother presentations include gastrointestinal bleeding,\\nperforation, and large masses.32 I could find only\\ntwo reported cases of metastatic melanoma that re-\\nsulted in protein-losing enteropathy.34,35\\nSeveral mechanisms may explain a protein-losing\\nenteropathy in cases of melanoma. One is lymphatic\\nobstruction due to lymph-node metastasis. In this\\ncase, the presence of a pericardial effusion raises the\\nadditional possibility of cardiac metastasis, with right-\\nsided heart failure, dilatation of the intestinal lym-\\nphatics, and loss of enteric protein. However, an\\neffusion could have been the result of the hypopro-\\nteinemia itself. Another mechanism for the produc-\\ntion of a protein-losing enteropathy is inflammation\\nand ulceration of the small-bowel mucosa involved\\nby tumor, with an exudate containing plasma pro-\\nteins. The radiologic appearance of the small bowel\\nin this case, with some areas diffusely thickened and\\nothers much less abnormal, also favors the presence\\nof metastatic melanoma, and the positive test for oc-\\ncult blood suggests that the tumor caused mucosal\\nulceration.\\nThe aspect of this case that is most difficult to ex-\\nplain is the temporal association between the onset\\nof symptoms and radiation therapy. Intestinal lym-\\nphangiectasia due to abdominal radiation therapy\\nhas been reported.36 Since the radiation port was in\\nthe left side of the upper chest, however, it would\\nnot be expected to injure the abdominal organs, and\\nradiation-associated enteritis or colitis is thus highly\\nunlikely. The association of the radiation therapy\\nwith the onset of symptoms was probably coinciden-\\ntal, and the symptoms were probably manifestations\\nof rapidly advancing disease. The high white-cell count with myelocytes and metamyelocytes in the\\nperipheral blood is also uncharacteristic of malig-\\nnant melanoma. However, bone marrow is an occa-\\nsional site of metastatic melanoma. Also, a leukemoid\\nreaction to tumor or a focus of infection, such as the\\nreaction that might be caused by a microperforation\\nof the bowel, could lead to this abnormality in the\\nwhite-cell count.\\nMetastasis of melanoma to the gastrointestinal\\ntract usually reflects widespread disease, with a poor\\nprognosis. In one large series, more than 80 percent\\nof patients with visceral metastases died within a\\nyear after the metastases had been detected.37\\nMy final diagnosis is protein-losing enteropathy\\ndue to metastatic malignant melanoma. The diag-\\nnostic procedure was probably a small-bowel biopsy,\\nwhich I would have attempted first endoscopically,\\nwith a surgical procedure performed only if the en-\\ndoscopic approach was unsuccessful.\\nDR. KURT J. ISSELBACHER: One of the striking\\nfindings in this case was the low lymphocyte count,\\nwhich is consistent with the loss of lymphocytes as\\nwell as protein into the intestinal lumen. Are the\\nradiologic changes suggestive of thickening of the\\nbowel wall due to lymphatic obstruction, tumor in-\\nfiltration, or both?\\nDR. O\\'NEILL: The presence of long segments of\\ndiffusely involved small bowel, as well as areas of rel-\\native sparing, is most suggestive of tumor infiltra-\\ntion. Also, the mesenteric lymphadenopathy does not\\nappear to be extensive enough to cause lymphatic\\nobstruction.\\nDR. ARTHUR J. SOBER: This patient had a very\\nthin primary melanoma, which is usually associated\\nwith a favorable outcome. Every invasive melanoma\\ncarries some risk of recurrence, however, and thin\\nprimary melanomas can recur after 10 years. There\\nis probably no interval after which one can assure a\\npatient with cutaneous melanoma that he or she is\\ncured. Our group recently analyzed the cases of 20\\npatients at the Melanoma Center of the Massachu-\\nsetts General Hospital who had recurrences between\\n15 and 27 years after the removal of the primary tu-\\nmor.38 About half the recurrences involved lymph\\nnodes; the prognosis was relatively favorable in these\\ncases. The other recurrences were mostly visceral\\nand were associated with an unfavorable outcome.\\nOur differential diagnosis was similar to that of\\nDr. Syngal. We favored the diagnosis of metastatic\\nmalignant melanoma largely because of the adrenal\\nmass and the finding of 64 involved axillary lymph\\nnodes.\\nDR. DANIEL C. CHUNG: The Gastrointestinal\\nService also favored the diagnosis of infiltration of\\nthe wall of the small intestine by metastatic melano-\\nma, even though it typically metastasizes to the\\nsmall intestine as discrete nodules rather than as dif-\\nfuse infiltrative disease. Endoscopic examination re-vealed markedly thickened, granular mucosa through-\\nout the patient\\'s stomach, duodenum, and proximal\\njejunum, as well as a large gastric bezoar.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nMetastatic malignant melanoma, with protein-los-\\ning enteropathy.\\nDR. SAPNA SYNGAL\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nProtein-losing enteropathy due to metastatic ma-\\nlignant melanoma.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. STAMATINA KAPTAIN: Microscopical exami-\\nnation of a biopsy specimen of jejunum submitted\\nto the pathology laboratory (Fig. 5 and 6) showed\\nthat the villi were expanded by a dense proliferation\\nof tumor cells that were typical of malignant-mela-\\nnoma cells. A gastric biopsy performed at the same\\ntime showed a similar pattern of involvement by\\nmetastatic melanoma.\\nThe most widely accepted staging system for pri-\\nmary cutaneous malignant melanoma was devised\\nby the American Joint Committee on Cancer Stag-\\ning.39 According to this system, stage I indicates tu-\\nmor that is confined to the skin and no more than\\n1.5 mm thick and that does not invade the reticular\\ndermis. Stage I disease is subdivided into IA and IB\\naccording to whether the tumor is less than 0.75\\nmm thick or 0.75 to 1.5 mm thick and according to\\nwhether it invades the papillary-reticular dermal in-\\nterface. The estimated rates of survival at 15 years for\\npatients with stage I, II, III, and IV disease are 47\\npercent, 39 percent, 13 percent, and 2 percent, re-\\nspectively. 40\\nSubclassification of stage I and II disease relies on\\nthe histologic evaluation of the thickness of the tu-\\nmor and the level of invasion. Most studies show\\nthat the Breslow measurement of thickness41 is the\\nsingle most important prognostic factor in stage I\\nand II disease.42,43 Prognostically favorable lesions\\nare less than 0.75 mm thick, and prognostically un-\\nfavorable lesions are more than 4 mm thick. The an-\\natomical level of invasion, as defined by Clark et\\nal.,44 is usually correlated with the Breslow measure-\\nment of thickness and is an additional prognostic in-\\ndicator.\\nAccording to a model recently developed by Soong\\nand Weiss,45 a patient with a primary melanoma like\\nthat under discussion (less than 0.75 mm thick, with\\nClark level II penetration and a location on the axial\\nskeleton) should have a 96 percent chance of surviv-\\ning for 5 years and a 92 percent chance of surviving\\nfor 10 years. Some observers, however, have reported\\nmetastases in as many as 9.3 percent of patients with\\ntumors in this category. 46,47 In one study of 1668\\npatients with stage I melanomas that were less than\\n0.5 mm thick, only 3 percent had recurrences, and only 2 percent had lymph-node or visceral metas-\\ntases after a median follow-up period of more than\\n17 years.46\\nRegardless of the thickness of the tumor, the first\\nmetastatic deposit appears after 10 years in less than\\n6 percent of patients with malignant melanoma. 48,49\\nThe tumor can metastasize to virtually any organ,\\nbut the most common initial sites of distant metas-\\ntasis are skin and subcutaneous tissue (in 42 to\\n59 percent of patients), followed by the lung (18\\nto 36 percent), liver (14 to 20 percent), brain (12\\nto 20 percent), bone (11 to 17 percent), and gastro-\\nintestinal tract (1 to 7 percent).50 At autopsy, many\\norgan systems are found to harbor clinically silent\\nmetastatic disease. Most patients with disseminated\\ndisease die from involvement of the lung or brain.50\\nMelanoma is the most common tumor that me-\\ntastasizes to the gastrointestinal tract. In one study,\\nhematogenous dissemination to the gastrointestinal\\nsystem (small intestine) was found at autopsy in 58\\npercent of patients with metastatic melanoma, as\\ncompared with 6.5 percent of patients with meta-\\nstatic breast carcinoma and 6.2 percent of patients\\nwith metastatic lung carcinoma.51 Some studies in-\\ndicate that malignant melanoma accounts for up to\\n70 percent of metastatic tumors involving the small\\nintestine.52 Within the gastrointestinal tract, meta-static melanoma most frequently involves the je-\\njunum and ileum (in 26 to 58 percent of cases), fol-\\nlowed by the colon and rectum (5 to 28 percent),\\nstomach (7 to 24 percent), duodenum (12 to 19\\npercent), and esophagus (3 to 9 percent).49\\nAlthough melanoma rarely metastasizes only to\\nthe gastrointestinal tract, the initial manifestation of\\nmetastatic disease in 7 to 32 percent of patients is\\nthe development of gastrointestinal symptoms.53\\nDR. FRANK G. HALUSKA: The optimal therapy\\nfor melanoma confined to the regional lymph nodes\\nis radiation therapy followed by the intravenous ad-\\nministration of interferon alfa, but in this case the\\ntumor disseminated rapidly. There is no very effec-\\ntive therapy for disseminated melanoma, although\\nboth cytotoxic chemotherapy and the administra-\\ntion of cytokines, such as interleukin-2, have been\\nused. Unfortunately, this patient died of cardiorespi-\\nratory failure several days after the diagnostic proce-\\ndure was performed.\\nDR. KAPTAIN: At autopsy, there was evidence of\\nwidely disseminated disease involving almost every\\norgan. Examination of the small intestine (Fig. 7)\\nshowed diffuse thickening of the mucosal folds, with little or no involvement of the deeper layers of the\\nbowel wall, as well as multiple pigmented mucosal\\nnodules, 0.4 to 3 cm in the greatest dimension. Dil-\\natation of lymphatic vessels and edema were not his-\\ntologically prominent features. The tumor in the\\nright adrenal gland proved to be an adenoma, 5 by\\n4 by 1.5 cm, not melanoma.

      "{'query': 'A 50-year-old woman was admitted to the hospi-\\ntal because of diarrhea that had developed during\\nradiation treatment.\\nThe patient had been well until 15 years earlier,\\nwhen a stage 1A, Clark level II malignant melanoma\\n(Fig. 1), 0.45 mm in thickness, was excised from her\\nback. Six months before admission, a mammograph-\\nic examination showed a left axillary mass. A biopsy\\nof the mass performed 21 weeks before admission\\nshowed metastatic melanoma. Ten days later, a com-\\nputed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest showed\\nmultiple enlarged axillary lymph nodes and minimal\\npericardial fluid or thickening. An abdominal CT\\nscan (Fig. 2) showed a right adrenal mass, 2 cm in\\ndiameter, and a lesion in the right hepatic lobe, 1 cm\\nin diameter — findings suggesting the presence of a\\nhemangioma.\\nA left axillary lymph-node dissection was per-\\nformed 162 weeks before admission. Microscopical\\nexamination of the specimen showed metastatic mel-\\nanoma in 40 lymph nodes at levels I and II and in\\n24 lymph nodes at level III. A drain was left in the\\nincision for 10 days. Soon after its removal, fever de-\\nveloped; cephalexin was administered, with resolu-\\ntion of the fever.\\nExamination of the patient at this hospital 14\\nweeks before admission showed no evidence of tu-\\nmor. The results of hematologic and blood chemical\\ntests performed at this time and subsequently are\\nshown in Tables 1 and 2. Eleven weeks before ad-\\nmission, radiation treatment (total dose, 60 Gy) was\\nadministered through a port on the left side of the\\nupper chest over a six-week period. Diarrhea devel-\\noped early in this period and gradually increased,\\nwith the passage of 10 to 15 stools daily by the end of the course of radiation treatment. The diarrhea\\nwas accompanied by occasional fecal incontinence,\\nheartburn, nausea, and vomiting. There was no ab-\\ndominal pain or hematochezia. Cephalexin was dis-\\ncontinued, and metronidazole was prescribed, with-\\nout improvement.\\nTwo weeks before admission, radiographs of the\\nchest showed an infiltrate or early atelectasis in the\\nleft upper lobe and blunting of the right costo-\\nphrenic sulcus. A stool culture yielded no pathogens.\\nMicroscopical examination of two stool specimens\\nshowed no ova or parasites, and a test for Clostridi-\\num difficile toxin was negative. Six days before ad-\\nmission, a CT scan of the abdomen (Fig. 3 and 4),\\nobtained after the administration of contrast materi-\\nal, showed mesenteric lymphadenopathy and the right\\nadrenal mass. The small bowel was markedly and dif-\\nfusely thickened, without evidence of obstruction.\\nThe large bowel appeared normal. Subsequently, the\\npatient became dyspneic and very weak and was un-\\nable to walk without assistance. She was admitted to\\nthe hospital.\\nThe patient had a clerical occupation. She had a\\nhistory of hypertension, depression, and marked obe-\\nsity, with a weight loss of nearly 70 kg on a diet dur-\\ning the 18 months before admission and an addi-\\ntional loss of 4 to 5 kg during the week before\\nadmission, despite the development of peripheral ede-\\nma. Her medications consisted of amitriptyline, dox-\\nazosin, loperamide, and ibuprofen. A younger sister\\nhad been treated for malignant melanoma.\\nThe temperature was 36.4°C, the pulse was 92,\\nand the respirations were 16. The blood pressure\\nwas 75/40 mm Hg.\\nPhysical examination showed mild tenderness in\\nthe epigastrium and right upper quadrant, without masses, organomegaly, guarding, or rebound tender-\\nness. There was peripheral edema (+++). Rectal ex-\\namination showed no abnormalities. A brown-liquid\\nstool specimen was positive (+) for occult blood.\\nThe urine was positive for protein (+) and biliru-\\nbin (+). The sediment contained no red cells, 0 to\\n2 white cells, and moderate numbers of bacteria per\\nhigh-power field. Radiographs of the chest showed\\nno change in the infiltrate. A cardiac ultrasonograph-\\nic study showed an echo-free space between the vis-\\nceral and parietal pericardium, a finding consistent\\nwith the presence of a minimal effusion, pericardial\\nfat, or both. Fluids and electrolytes were administered.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. SAPNA SYNGAL*: May we review the radio-\\nlogic studies?\\nDR. MARY JANE O\\'NEILL: The first CT image\\n(Fig. 2) shows a mass, 2 cm in diameter, in the right\\nadrenal gland. Because the study was performed af-\\nter the administration of contrast material, it cannot\\nbe determined whether the mass is an adenoma or\\nmetastatic tumor. Images at lower levels (Fig. 3 and\\n4) reveal marked thickening of multiple loops of\\nsmall bowel and extensive mesenteric lymph-node\\nenlargement.\\nDR. SYNGAL: The diagnostic tests available for pa-\\ntients presenting with diarrhea include studies of fe-\\ncal fat, white cells, and osmolarity; breath tests that\\ndocument malabsorption; and endoscopic studies.\\nUsually, however, one can focus on the salient fea-\\ntures of the history, physical examination, and screen-\\ning laboratory tests to direct the diagnostic approach\\nto specific diseases.\\nThe most striking feature of this patient\\'s illness is\\nthe relatively rapid development of hypoproteinemia\\nwith severe peripheral edema. The interpretation of\\nthis feature is complicated by the history of metastat-\\nic melanoma. Hypoalbuminemia is one of the most\\nfrequent nonspecific abnormalities associated with\\ncancer, and it is usually due to decreased synthesis of\\nalbumin.¹ Although this patient had lost a consider-\\nable amount of weight on a diet, her presentation\\nwas not characteristic of malnutrition, and most of\\nthe weight loss antedated the onset of her symptoms\\nby at least a year. Also, she had a relatively low level\\nof proteinuria, which would not be expected to lead\\nto severe hypoproteinemia. The rapidity and the\\nmagnitude of the reduction in the protein level as-\\nsociated with severe diarrhea suggest that enteric\\nloss is the most likely explanation and that the pa-\\ntient has protein-losing enteropathy. Objective evi-\\ndence of enteric loss of protein can be obtained most easily by the demonstration of an increase in\\nfecal alpha₁-antitrypsin clearance,² which was not done\\nin this case. The diagnosis of protein-losing enterop-\\nathy can often be inferred clinically, however, when\\ngastrointestinal symptoms are associated with hypo-\\nproteinemia in the absence of malnutrition, in the\\nabsence of renal disease with proteinuria, and in the\\nabsence of hepatic disease that results in decreased\\nprotein synthesis.\\nExcessive loss of plasma protein into the gut may\\nbe caused by lymphatic disorders or by mucosal loss\\nat any site in the gastrointestinal tract due to ulcer-\\native or nonulcerative disease.\\nIntestinal lymphangiectasia may be congenital or\\nmay be caused by diseases that disrupt lymphatic\\ndrainage. The congenital form generally presents by\\nthe age of 30 years, with edema, diarrhea, hypopro-\\nteinemia, and lymphocytopenia, unlike the clinical\\npresentation in this case. Secondary intestinal lym-\\nphangiectasia can result from trauma or obstruction\\nof lymphatic flow within any intestinal layer. Cardiac\\ndisorders with right-sided heart failure, such as con-\\nstrictive pericarditis and tricuspid insufficiency, can\\ncause secondary intestinal lymphangiectasia¹; diseas-\\nes resulting in mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphad-\\nenopathy, including sarcoidosis, Whipple\\'s disease,5\\nand lymphoma, can also lead to a protein-losing en-\\nteropathy.\\nCertain other causes of protein-losing enteropa-\\nthy can be ruled out in this case. The radiologic\\nstudies indicating small-bowel involvement are strong\\nevidence against both Ménétrier\\'s disease and ul-\\ncerative colitis. Systemic diseases such as systemic lu-\\npus erythematosus and amyloidosis8-10 could explain\\nsome, but not all, of the symptoms and findings in\\nthis case.\\nAmong the disorders that primarily affect the\\nsmall intestine and can be associated with protein-\\nlosing enteropathy is eosinophilic gastroenteropathy,\\na category that includes a spectrum of diseases char-\\nacterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the gastroin-\\ntestinal tract. The association of eosinophilic gastro-\\nenteropathy with ingestion of specific foods is less\\nfrequent in adults than in infants. Patients who have\\neosinophilic gastroenteropathy with predominantly\\nmucosal or submucosal involvement or both may\\npresent with diarrhea and weight loss associated with\\nsmall-bowel thickening on radiologic studies. How-\\never, other common features of eosinophilic gastro-\\nenteropathy, such as peripheral eosinophilia and a\\nhistory of atopy, were not present in this case, and\\nthis disorder would not explain the rapidly rising\\nlevel of lactate dehydrogenase and the adrenal mass.\\nMany acute and chronic infections of the gastro-\\nintestinal tract have been associated with protein-\\nlosing enteropathy, including infection with C. dif-\\nficile,11 giardiasis,12 schistosomiasis,13 viral enteritis,14\\nand bacterial overgrowth,15 as well as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Cultures for\\nenteric pathogens, stool examination for ova and\\nparasites, and a test for C. difficile toxin were nega-\\ntive, however, in this case. There was no eosinophil-\\nia, which is a characteristic feature of parasitic infec-\\ntion, and metronidazole therapy would be expected\\nto lead to improvement if the patient had C. difficile\\ninfection or bacterial overgrowth in the bowel. The\\npatient had no risk factors for infection with the hu-\\nman immunodeficiency virus, and there is no indica-\\ntion that she had AIDS.\\nWhipple\\'s disease, a rare systemic illness that can\\naffect virtually any organ system in the body, should\\nbe considered. 16 Small-intestinal involvement is com-\\nmon and can lead to thickening of the wall similar\\nto that seen in this patient. Many of the clinical find-\\nings in this case, including lymphadenopathy, weight\\nloss, diarrhea, and pleural and pericardial effusions,\\nmay be present in patients with Whipple\\'s disease.\\nThe diagnosis can be made on the basis of peroral\\nintestinal biopsy with the demonstration of macro-\\nphages by periodic acid-Schiff staining. Whipple\\'s\\ndisease is far more common in men than in women,\\nhowever, and it would not explain the adrenal mass\\nand rapidly rising level of lactate dehydrogenase in\\nthis patient.\\nAlthough antibiotic-associated diarrhea is com-\\nmon and this patient was treated with cephalexin,\\nthe diarrhea is rarely as severe as in this case and it\\ngenerally does not persist as long after the discon-\\ntinuation of the antibiotic. Of the medications pre-\\nscribed in this case, the one that should be consid-\\nered most strongly as a cause of protein loss is\\nibuprofen. The gastropathy associated with nonste-\\nroidal antiinflammatory drugs is well known,17 but\\ntheir effects on the small and large intestine have\\nonly recently been fully recognized. Inflammation of\\nthe small intestine occurs in up to 65 percent of pa-\\ntients receiving these drugs over a long period and\\ncan result in bleeding, protein loss, or intestinal\\nstrictures. 18 However, enteropathy due to nonsteroi-\\ndal antiinflammatory drugs would not explain many\\nof the other features of this patient\\'s illness.\\nIn patients with celiac sprue, gluten damages the\\nsmall-bowel mucosa. Symptoms may begin at any\\ntime of life. The disease is characterized by malab-\\nsorption of nutrients and improvement of symptoms\\nafter the elimination of gluten from the diet.19 Pa-\\ntients with celiac sprue are at increased risk for\\ncancer, 20 including small-intestinal lymphoma and\\nadenocarcinoma, which can lead to the lymphade-\\nnopathy and small-bowel thickening seen on the CT\\nscan in this case. In the absence of superimposed\\ncancer, however, celiac sprue does not explain all the\\nclinical features of this case. Protein-losing enterop-\\nathy is a complication of many types of cancer, in-\\ncluding lymphoma, 21 carcinoid tumor with the car-\\ncinoid syndrome, Kaposi\\'s sarcoma, 22 leukemia, 23 and carcinomas, as well as one or more polyps of the gas-\\ntrointestinal tract.¹\\nPatients with malignant melanoma may be at in-\\ncreased risk for secondary cancers associated with fa-\\nmilial cancer syndromes, such as the Li-Fraumeni\\nsyndrome,24 hereditary retinoblastoma,25 and famil-\\nial melanoma.26 However, a hereditary cancer syn-\\ndrome is not necessarily implicated in this case. The\\ndevelopment of melanoma at a relatively young age\\nin both the patient and her sister could have result-\\ned from nongenetic risk factors, such as exposure to\\nthe sun.\\nApart from hereditary factors, patients with mela-\\nnoma may be at increased risk for secondary cancers,\\nincluding other skin cancers and nondermatologic\\ntumors such as lymphoma.27 The small intestine may\\nbe primarily or secondarily involved by lymphoma.\\nImmunoproliferative small-intestinal disease is the\\nmost common form of primary lymphoma of the\\nsmall bowel in the Middle East and Africa. It is char-\\nacterized by diffuse small-bowel involvement and of-\\nten by the triad of abdominal pain, malabsorption,\\nand clubbing at presentation. In developed coun-\\ntries, primary intestinal lymphomas are characterized\\nby diffuse infiltrates or nodular masses; involvement\\nof the mesenteric lymph nodes is common. Many of\\nthe features of this case are consistent with the pres-\\nence of an intestinal lymphoma, including the clini-\\ncal presentation of diarrhea and protein-losing enter-\\nopathy, the radiologic appearance of the small bowel,\\nand the rising lactate dehydrogenase level. The one\\nfeature that is difficult to attribute to lymphoma, how-\\never, is the presence of the adrenal mass.\\nAdrenal masses are seen on 0.6 percent of abdom-\\ninal CT scans. 28 Most of these masses are adenomas.\\nAlthough lesions greater than 5 cm in diameter are\\nmore likely to be malignant than smaller lesions, can-\\ncer cannot be ruled out on the basis of the size of\\nthe mass. The patient under discussion does not have\\nthe clinical features associated with a functioning\\nadrenocortical tumor. Pheochromocytomas can se-\\ncrete vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, causing diar-\\nrhea, but it is usually severe and watery, with hypo-\\nkalemia and acidosis. 29 This patient did not have\\nelectrolyte abnormalities, and the hypoproteinemia is\\nnot consistent with the presence of secretory diarrhea.\\nA classic principle of internal medicine is to at-\\ntempt, whenever possible, to make one diagnosis\\nthat explains all the features of a patient\\'s illness, and\\nin this case, malignant melanoma is such a diagnosis.\\nIt accounts for only 1 to 3 percent of all cancers but\\nfor over two thirds of all deaths related to skin can-\\ncer. Several features of this patient\\'s illness suggest\\nthe presence of widespread, rapidly progressive met-\\nastatic disease. The adrenal gland is a common site\\nof metastasis in patients with malignant melanoma,\\nand mesenteric lymphadenopathy is also consistent\\nwith the presence of metastatic disease. In addition, a high lactate dehydrogenase level is frequently asso-\\nciated with malignant melanoma.\\nMalignant melanoma is the most common tumor\\nthat metastasizes to the gastrointestinal tract,30 spread-\\ning to it by direct extension or by the lymphatics.\\nAutopsy studies have shown gastrointestinal metas-\\ntases in 50 to 60 percent of patients with melano-\\nma,31 but most metastases are not diagnosed before\\ndeath. 30 The small bowel is the most frequent intes-\\ntinal site of metastasis, and in one autopsy series, 58\\npercent of patients with gastrointestinal metastatic\\nmelanoma had small-bowel involvement.31\\nBowel metastases may appear radiologically as pol-\\nypoid mucosal lesions, submucosal nodules, diffuse\\ninfiltration with thickening of the intestinal wall, or\\nserosal implants.32 The most common radiologic\\nappearance is that of a \"bull\\'s eye,\" which is seen\\nwhen barium occupies a central ulcer in a metastatic\\nnodule.33\\nMetastatic melanoma can cause a wide variety of\\nnonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms, including vom-\\niting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Bow-\\nel obstruction due to intussusception is a common\\nclinical presentation of gastrointestinal metastasis;\\nother presentations include gastrointestinal bleeding,\\nperforation, and large masses.32 I could find only\\ntwo reported cases of metastatic melanoma that re-\\nsulted in protein-losing enteropathy.34,35\\nSeveral mechanisms may explain a protein-losing\\nenteropathy in cases of melanoma. One is lymphatic\\nobstruction due to lymph-node metastasis. In this\\ncase, the presence of a pericardial effusion raises the\\nadditional possibility of cardiac metastasis, with right-\\nsided heart failure, dilatation of the intestinal lym-\\nphatics, and loss of enteric protein. However, an\\neffusion could have been the result of the hypopro-\\nteinemia itself. Another mechanism for the produc-\\ntion of a protein-losing enteropathy is inflammation\\nand ulceration of the small-bowel mucosa involved\\nby tumor, with an exudate containing plasma pro-\\nteins. The radiologic appearance of the small bowel\\nin this case, with some areas diffusely thickened and\\nothers much less abnormal, also favors the presence\\nof metastatic melanoma, and the positive test for oc-\\ncult blood suggests that the tumor caused mucosal\\nulceration.\\nThe aspect of this case that is most difficult to ex-\\nplain is the temporal association between the onset\\nof symptoms and radiation therapy. Intestinal lym-\\nphangiectasia due to abdominal radiation therapy\\nhas been reported.36 Since the radiation port was in\\nthe left side of the upper chest, however, it would\\nnot be expected to injure the abdominal organs, and\\nradiation-associated enteritis or colitis is thus highly\\nunlikely. The association of the radiation therapy\\nwith the onset of symptoms was probably coinciden-\\ntal, and the symptoms were probably manifestations\\nof rapidly advancing disease. The high white-cell count with myelocytes and metamyelocytes in the\\nperipheral blood is also uncharacteristic of malig-\\nnant melanoma. However, bone marrow is an occa-\\nsional site of metastatic melanoma. Also, a leukemoid\\nreaction to tumor or a focus of infection, such as the\\nreaction that might be caused by a microperforation\\nof the bowel, could lead to this abnormality in the\\nwhite-cell count.\\nMetastasis of melanoma to the gastrointestinal\\ntract usually reflects widespread disease, with a poor\\nprognosis. In one large series, more than 80 percent\\nof patients with visceral metastases died within a\\nyear after the metastases had been detected.37\\nMy final diagnosis is protein-losing enteropathy\\ndue to metastatic malignant melanoma. The diag-\\nnostic procedure was probably a small-bowel biopsy,\\nwhich I would have attempted first endoscopically,\\nwith a surgical procedure performed only if the en-\\ndoscopic approach was unsuccessful.\\nDR. KURT J. ISSELBACHER: One of the striking\\nfindings in this case was the low lymphocyte count,\\nwhich is consistent with the loss of lymphocytes as\\nwell as protein into the intestinal lumen. Are the\\nradiologic changes suggestive of thickening of the\\nbowel wall due to lymphatic obstruction, tumor in-\\nfiltration, or both?\\nDR. O\\'NEILL: The presence of long segments of\\ndiffusely involved small bowel, as well as areas of rel-\\native sparing, is most suggestive of tumor infiltra-\\ntion. Also, the mesenteric lymphadenopathy does not\\nappear to be extensive enough to cause lymphatic\\nobstruction.\\nDR. ARTHUR J. SOBER: This patient had a very\\nthin primary melanoma, which is usually associated\\nwith a favorable outcome. Every invasive melanoma\\ncarries some risk of recurrence, however, and thin\\nprimary melanomas can recur after 10 years. There\\nis probably no interval after which one can assure a\\npatient with cutaneous melanoma that he or she is\\ncured. Our group recently analyzed the cases of 20\\npatients at the Melanoma Center of the Massachu-\\nsetts General Hospital who had recurrences between\\n15 and 27 years after the removal of the primary tu-\\nmor.38 About half the recurrences involved lymph\\nnodes; the prognosis was relatively favorable in these\\ncases. The other recurrences were mostly visceral\\nand were associated with an unfavorable outcome.\\nOur differential diagnosis was similar to that of\\nDr. Syngal. We favored the diagnosis of metastatic\\nmalignant melanoma largely because of the adrenal\\nmass and the finding of 64 involved axillary lymph\\nnodes.\\nDR. DANIEL C. CHUNG: The Gastrointestinal\\nService also favored the diagnosis of infiltration of\\nthe wall of the small intestine by metastatic melano-\\nma, even though it typically metastasizes to the\\nsmall intestine as discrete nodules rather than as dif-\\nfuse infiltrative disease. Endoscopic examination re-vealed markedly thickened, granular mucosa through-\\nout the patient\\'s stomach, duodenum, and proximal\\njejunum, as well as a large gastric bezoar.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nMetastatic malignant melanoma, with protein-los-\\ning enteropathy.\\nDR. SAPNA SYNGAL\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nProtein-losing enteropathy due to metastatic ma-\\nlignant melanoma.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. STAMATINA KAPTAIN: Microscopical exami-\\nnation of a biopsy specimen of jejunum submitted\\nto the pathology laboratory (Fig. 5 and 6) showed\\nthat the villi were expanded by a dense proliferation\\nof tumor cells that were typical of malignant-mela-\\nnoma cells. A gastric biopsy performed at the same\\ntime showed a similar pattern of involvement by\\nmetastatic melanoma.\\nThe most widely accepted staging system for pri-\\nmary cutaneous malignant melanoma was devised\\nby the American Joint Committee on Cancer Stag-\\ning.39 According to this system, stage I indicates tu-\\nmor that is confined to the skin and no more than\\n1.5 mm thick and that does not invade the reticular\\ndermis. Stage I disease is subdivided into IA and IB\\naccording to whether the tumor is less than 0.75\\nmm thick or 0.75 to 1.5 mm thick and according to\\nwhether it invades the papillary-reticular dermal in-\\nterface. The estimated rates of survival at 15 years for\\npatients with stage I, II, III, and IV disease are 47\\npercent, 39 percent, 13 percent, and 2 percent, re-\\nspectively. 40\\nSubclassification of stage I and II disease relies on\\nthe histologic evaluation of the thickness of the tu-\\nmor and the level of invasion. Most studies show\\nthat the Breslow measurement of thickness41 is the\\nsingle most important prognostic factor in stage I\\nand II disease.42,43 Prognostically favorable lesions\\nare less than 0.75 mm thick, and prognostically un-\\nfavorable lesions are more than 4 mm thick. The an-\\natomical level of invasion, as defined by Clark et\\nal.,44 is usually correlated with the Breslow measure-\\nment of thickness and is an additional prognostic in-\\ndicator.\\nAccording to a model recently developed by Soong\\nand Weiss,45 a patient with a primary melanoma like\\nthat under discussion (less than 0.75 mm thick, with\\nClark level II penetration and a location on the axial\\nskeleton) should have a 96 percent chance of surviv-\\ning for 5 years and a 92 percent chance of surviving\\nfor 10 years. Some observers, however, have reported\\nmetastases in as many as 9.3 percent of patients with\\ntumors in this category. 46,47 In one study of 1668\\npatients with stage I melanomas that were less than\\n0.5 mm thick, only 3 percent had recurrences, and only 2 percent had lymph-node or visceral metas-\\ntases after a median follow-up period of more than\\n17 years.46\\nRegardless of the thickness of the tumor, the first\\nmetastatic deposit appears after 10 years in less than\\n6 percent of patients with malignant melanoma. 48,49\\nThe tumor can metastasize to virtually any organ,\\nbut the most common initial sites of distant metas-\\ntasis are skin and subcutaneous tissue (in 42 to\\n59 percent of patients), followed by the lung (18\\nto 36 percent), liver (14 to 20 percent), brain (12\\nto 20 percent), bone (11 to 17 percent), and gastro-\\nintestinal tract (1 to 7 percent).50 At autopsy, many\\norgan systems are found to harbor clinically silent\\nmetastatic disease. Most patients with disseminated\\ndisease die from involvement of the lung or brain.50\\nMelanoma is the most common tumor that me-\\ntastasizes to the gastrointestinal tract. In one study,\\nhematogenous dissemination to the gastrointestinal\\nsystem (small intestine) was found at autopsy in 58\\npercent of patients with metastatic melanoma, as\\ncompared with 6.5 percent of patients with meta-\\nstatic breast carcinoma and 6.2 percent of patients\\nwith metastatic lung carcinoma.51 Some studies in-\\ndicate that malignant melanoma accounts for up to\\n70 percent of metastatic tumors involving the small\\nintestine.52 Within the gastrointestinal tract, meta-static melanoma most frequently involves the je-\\njunum and ileum (in 26 to 58 percent of cases), fol-\\nlowed by the colon and rectum (5 to 28 percent),\\nstomach (7 to 24 percent), duodenum (12 to 19\\npercent), and esophagus (3 to 9 percent).49\\nAlthough melanoma rarely metastasizes only to\\nthe gastrointestinal tract, the initial manifestation of\\nmetastatic disease in 7 to 32 percent of patients is\\nthe development of gastrointestinal symptoms.53\\nDR. FRANK G. HALUSKA: The optimal therapy\\nfor melanoma confined to the regional lymph nodes\\nis radiation therapy followed by the intravenous ad-\\nministration of interferon alfa, but in this case the\\ntumor disseminated rapidly. There is no very effec-\\ntive therapy for disseminated melanoma, although\\nboth cytotoxic chemotherapy and the administra-\\ntion of cytokines, such as interleukin-2, have been\\nused. Unfortunately, this patient died of cardiorespi-\\nratory failure several days after the diagnostic proce-\\ndure was performed.\\nDR. KAPTAIN: At autopsy, there was evidence of\\nwidely disseminated disease involving almost every\\norgan. Examination of the small intestine (Fig. 7)\\nshowed diffuse thickening of the mucosal folds, with little or no involvement of the deeper layers of the\\nbowel wall, as well as multiple pigmented mucosal\\nnodules, 0.4 to 3 cm in the greatest dimension.

Be concise and grounded.\\n\\n# PATIENT CASE\\nA 28-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of gram-negative sepsis.\\nThe patient had been in excellent health until three weeks earlier, when malaise developed. Ten days before admission, he attended a wedding. The next day he had fatigue, anorexia, and malaise, which waxed and waned. Four days before admission, his temperature rose to 40.6°C, with rigors, sweats, and difficulty concentrating. Two days later, the patient had a severe occipital headache.\\nOne day before admission, the patient came to the emergency department at this hospital. The temperature was 38.7°C, the pulse was 120, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 135/80 mm Hg. The results of a physical examination and radiographic studies of the chest were normal. The results of laboratory tests are shown in Tables 1 and 2. A lumbar puncture was performed (Table 3). A specimen of cerebrospinal fluid and two specimens of blood were sent for culture, and the patient was discharged with a prescription for oxycodone-acetaminophen.\\nOn the following day, the blood cultures yielded gram-negative rods. The cerebrospinal fluid culture was sterile. The patient was contacted, and he returned to the hospital.\\nThe patient worked in a sedentary professional capacity. He resided in a city and had a monogamous relationship with a woman; his household included a healthy cat. He frequently had meals at restaurants.\\nHe had not traveled recently outside the United States and had no known exposure to sick persons. He had passed only two stools during the five days before admission. The patient had no risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and there was no history of inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, abdominal pain, stiffness of the neck, or visual changes or other neurologic symptoms.\\nThe temperature was 38.2°C, the pulse was 92, and the respirations were 24. The blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient had shaking chills. No rash, lymphadenopathy, or scleral injection was found. A grade 1 systolic murmur was present along the left sternal border. Abdominal examination revealed mild, diffuse tenderness without organomegaly. The results of a rectal examination were normal, and a stool specimen was negative for occult blood.\\nThe urine was positive for bilirubin (+), urobilinogen (+), and protein (++); the sediment contained 2 red cells, 2 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power field. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 97, with nonspecific T-wave abnormalities. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 1), obtained after the oral and intravenous administration of contrast material, showed thickening of the wall of the terminal ileum and an area of clumped mesenteric lymph nodes, more than 5 mm in the short axis, in the right lower quadrant. A cranial CT scan (Fig. 2), obtained before the intravenous injection of contrast material, showed an area of relative hypodensity, 1 cm in diameter, anterolateral to the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle superiorly. Additional punctate areas of hypodensity involved the forceps major region bilaterally.\\nTreatment with intravenous saline solution and gentamicin was begun. On the second hospital day, the shaking chills and headache persisted. The temperature was 40.2°C, the pulse was 92, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 115/70 mm Hg.\\nA diagnostic report was received.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. PAUL E. FARMER*: What disease might account for all the features of this man's illness? His clinical presentation, which included a sustained fever, headache, difficulty concentrating, malaise, abdominal pain, and relative bradycardia in the setting of a temperature of 40.2°C, differs from that of typical sepsis, which is characterized by an abrupt onset, hypotension, and tachycardia. Indeed, several features of this man's illness suggest enteric fever due to Salmonella typhi.\\nAt the Clinique Bon Sauveur in Cange, Haiti, where I spend half my clinical time, my colleagues and I diagnose typhoid fever on a daily basis. In 1993, we collected data on a total of 286 patients with this disease.¹ The clinical manifestations of typhoid fever in these patients are shown in Table 4.\\nMost patients with this disease have abdominal pain. S. typhi has a predilection for Peyer's patches in the distal small bowel, and ileal perforation is one of the fatal complications. In an important treatise on typhoid fever published in 1873, William Budd² stated that ileal ulcers were pathognomonic for typhoid. According to Budd, “morbid changes — always present in this disease, and never present in any other” are found in the distal ileum, where a “certain number of Peyer's patches, or of the isolated follicles, as the case may be, have acquired a great increase of thickness, and stand out in relief on the internal surface of the gut.”² In guinea-pig models, S. typhimurium attaches only to what appear to be specific receptors in the microvilli of the distal small bowel.³\\nMay we review the radiologic studies?\\nDR. PATRICK RAO: A selected axial image from the abdominal CT scan (Fig. 1), obtained after oral and intravenous administration of contrast material, shows marked thickening of the wall of the terminal ileum; pencil-thin and clumped oval soft-tissue densities, a finding consistent with the presence of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes that drain the terminal ileum, the appendix, and the cecum; and a distal ileal loop with an obviously thickened wall. An axial image from a cranial CT examination at the level of the bodies of the lateral ventricles (Fig. 2) reveals an area of slight hypodensity, 1 cm in diameter, anterolateral to the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle.\\nDR. FARMER: Although few patients with enteric fever ever undergo abdominal CT scanning, the CT findings in this case are consistent with the presence of this disease. Once the organisms have invaded Peyer's patches, multiplication takes place in mononuclear cells. Impaired phagocytosis often allows the organisms to reach mesenteric lymph nodes on their way to the bloodstream.⁴\\nThis patient also had constipation. Although diarrhea is often associated with enteric fever, in our series, constipation was more common, as others have also observed.⁵\\nBecause of the patient's severe headache and difficulty concentrating, both a lumbar puncture and cranial CT studies were performed. The findings in the cerebrospinal fluid were unimpressive, but the slightly hypodense area on the CT scan could have been a metastatic brain lesion⁶ or even a mycotic aneurysm. S. typhi is a leading cause of these lesions in developing countries. Brain biopsies are almost never performed, however, in cases of enteric fever.\\nOther forms of central nervous system involvement are more common than focal lesions. The term “typhoid” comes from the Greek word typhus, meaning “cloud” or “mist,” and Hippocrates used it to describe the clouded mental status of patients with unremitting fevers. In 1873, Budd noted that most patients showed their malady by “beginning to droop.”² One of the first large studies dealing with mental changes in patients with typhoid fever was reported by James Jackson,⁷ a contemporary of Budd, who analyzed 303 cases in patients seen at Massachusetts General Hospital between 1821 and 1835. Over a third of the patients had delirium, and many others presented with somnolence, deafness, or “watchfulness.” The pathogenesis of these alterations is unclear, but they may be unique to typhoid fever, rather than merely a nonspecific consequence of gram-negative sepsis.\\nIn my experience in Haiti, most patients present with headache, and mental-status changes are more common than rose spots. Children are listless and dull; adults may seem indifferent. More severe manifestations at presentation range from florid psychosis to coma.⁸⁻¹⁰\\nRelative bradycardia, which this patient had on the second hospital day, may be associated with typhoid fever.¹¹ Thirty-six percent of the patients in our series presented with a heart rate that was slow in relation to the height of their fever curves, a finding similar to that reported by others. Nonspecific T-wave abnormalities were also noted in this patient. Although at the clinic in Haiti, my colleagues and I do not perform electrocardiography in young febrile patients unless we suspect the presence of rheumatic fever or diphtheria, these abnormalities are the most common electrocardiographic changes reported in the literature on enteric fever.¹²,¹³\\nThe tracking of fever curves is a lost art, in part because effective chemotherapy is administered once the diagnosis of typhoid fever has been made. This patient's high, unremitting fever, however, is typical of typhoid fever. In much of the late 19th-century literature, “continued fever” is synonymous with typhoid fever.\\nThis patient did not have rose spots, a feature that is absent in 60 to 70 percent of patients with enteric fever. Rose spots, seen most often on the trunk, are due to capillary atony and are usually evanescent, sometimes lasting only a few hours. Cultures of these lesions may yield S. typhi.¹⁴,¹⁵ We seldom see rose spots in Haiti, but they can be difficult to detect in patients with dark skin.\\nFeatures of enteric fever still commonly seen in Haiti, such as epistaxis, are also seen in other regions where access to health care is poor. Joint involvement and ileal perforation are late complications and are more likely to develop in patients who have not received effective therapy. The high rate of catastrophic complications of this disease in Haiti reflects the large number of untreated patients. Although splenomegaly is a characteristic finding in Haiti, its absence in cases reported in the literature during the past two decades may reflect improved access to therapy.¹⁶\\nIn short, many clinical features of this case suggest the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and the laboratory data are consistent with it. Leukocytosis is unusual in patients with established enteric fever; mild leukopenia is more common. Anemia is often reported, especially where helminthiasis is endemic. In one large series of ileal perforations complicating enteric fever in rural Haiti, ascaris worms were often found in the peritoneum.¹⁷ Elevations of both aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase levels are seen in most cases of enteric fever, as is transient proteinuria without azotemia.\\nWith a broader differential diagnosis based on the clinical presentation, the first diseases to consider are paratyphoid fevers due to nontyphoidal serotypes of salmonella. Although several serotypes, including S. paratyphi A and B (S. schottmuelleri) and S. paratyphi C (S. hirschfeldii), may cause enteric fever, it is usually milder than that due to S. typhi.¹⁸,¹⁹ S. choleraesuis and S. anatum cause bacteremia with localized infection but seldom cause ileitis.²⁰ In the United States, the incidence of enteric fever due to nontyphoidal salmonella strains seems to be increasing, whereas the number of reported cases of typhoid fever remains small.²¹\\nYersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis may cause mesenteric lymphadenitis, with abdominal pain and fever, but positive blood cultures are unusual. Similarly, dysentery due to shigella may begin in the distal small bowel, but widespread colonic involvement accounts for the typical symptoms, and the organism is also rarely isolated from blood. Uncomplicated appendicitis generally does not lead to gram-negative bacteremia. Gram-negative sepsis due to bowel perforation in a patient with no history of trauma suggests the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, but this patient had no history of inflammatory bowel disease. Tuberculous ileitis, like Crohn's disease, may be associated with gram-negative bacteremia in the event of perforation, but it would probably be preceded by an indolent enteropathy, which is not suggested by this patient's history. Finally, his headache and fever suggest the presence of meningitis, but it was ruled out by lumbar puncture. In Haiti, fever and any neuropsychiatric impairment require that cerebral malaria be ruled out or that the patient receive empirical treatment for it. Malaria is not a consideration in this patient, since he had not traveled to a region where malaria is endemic.\\nGram-negative bacteremia, which is unusual in otherwise healthy young adults in the United States, is often due to pyelonephritis, but in this patient's age group, the disorder is more likely to affect women than men. The results of urinalysis, although abnormal, did not suggest that the patient had an infection of the upper urinary tract. Young adults with gram-negative bacteremia usually have a predisposing factor, such as neutropenia and cecitis after chemotherapy, a breach in the integrity of the bowel due to trauma or inflammatory bowel disease, or asplenia leading to difficulty clearing encapsulated organisms. This patient had no history of trauma or cancer, however, and he had an intact spleen. There is no reason to suspect HIV infection, which is associated with bacteremia caused by salmonella. Salmonella commonly causes bacteremia in persons with sickle cell anemia and other diseases associated with hemolysis, including malaria and bartonellosis. This patient, however, had a robust hematocrit and a normal-sized spleen on CT scanning.\\nWhat are the epidemiologic and bacteriologic features of gram-negative bacteremia in a Boston teaching hospital? Of over 5000 blood isolates cultured in 1990 and 1991 at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the majority were gram-positive organisms. Most of the gram-negative organisms were enteric flora (Table 5). Of these pathogens, only salmonella species are likely to cause the syndrome seen in this patient. Over the past decade, Brigham and Women's Hospital has had only 10 cases of bacteriologically confirmed enteric fever. Although it is now rare in the United States, enteric fever has not been eradicated. Since it is reportable, information on recent trends is available from the Massachusetts State Laboratory. Only 20 cases were reported to the laboratory in 1992, 34 in 1993, 19 in 1994, 31 in 1995, and 18 in 1996.\\nAccording to Jackson's study, S. typhi bacteremia was probably once the most common gram-negative bacteremia documented at Massachusetts General Hospital. It is exceedingly rare today. Half to two thirds of patients in the United States with confirmed disease due to S. typhi have a history of recent travel to areas where it is endemic,²² but a substantial minority of cases can be linked to improper handling of food. Various well-known cases of salmonellosis have been associated with consumption of food at picnics, consumption of potato salad, and contact with asymptomatic carriers of the organisms. One of the best-known carriers was the cook Mary Mallon (Typhoid Mary), whose asymptomatic carriage of S. typhi led to at least 51 cases of enteric fever and 3 deaths.²³ Less well known are some of the more recent outbreaks. In 1989, one cluster of 43 definite and 24 probable cases was linked to a person who had prepared about 200 liters of orange juice.²⁴ It is not clear how the patient under discussion was exposed to the organisms that caused his illness. It is difficult to be certain whether the infection began before or after the wedding he attended. It would be interesting to know more about his history of travel. Although he had not been outside the United States recently, he may have been exposed during travel a number of years earlier. In one reported case,²⁵ a patient presented with S. typhi cholecystitis and cholelithiasis 67 years after an attack of typhoid fever.\\nIn closing, I believe this patient had a typical case of a disease that is common in areas where typhoid fever due to poor sanitation remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the so-called postantibiotic era. According to international estimates, there are 12 million to 33 million cases of typhoid fever each year.²⁶ The diagnostic report in this case probably came from the microbiology laboratory, which with the help of the Massachusetts State Laboratory, probably identified the gram-negative bacillus as S. typhi.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nEnteric fever due to Salmonella typhi.\\nDR. PAUL E. FARMER’S DIAGNOSIS\\nEnteric fever due to Salmonella typhi, with the possible metastasis of lesions to the brain.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. NESLI BASGOZ: The diagnostic report contained the results of the blood culture, which grew S. typhi.\\nMS. MARGARET J. MURTAGH: The organism grew in both the aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures within 12 to 18 hours after collection. Gram's stains revealed gram-negative rods. The organism was identified as S. typhi on the basis of biochemical tests and agglutination tests that characterize the cell-wall lipopolysaccharide O antigen and the capsular polysaccharide Vi antigen. In contrast to most other salmonella species, S. typhi is easily identified with the use of commercial reagents.\\nDR. FIONA M. GRAEME-COOK: The radiologic finding of thickening of the wall of the terminal ileum with slightly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes is consistent with how this patient's small intestine would have appeared pathologically, had specimens been available.\\nThe wall of the terminal ileum would have been edematous and thickened. On the antimesenteric aspect of the luminal surface hyperplastic Peyer's patches with a maximal diameter of 5 cm would have been prominent. Pathological findings in a specimen of terminal ileum from another patient with typhoid fever (Fig. 3, 4, 5, and 6) suggest that tan, vertical ulcers might have been present in the centers of the Peyer's patches, with overlying, fibrinous exudate (Fig. 3). Microscopical examination in the region of Peyer's patches would have shown a thickened wall characterized by lymphoid hyperplasia and surface ulceration (Fig. 4), with a polymorphous infiltrate containing numerous plasma cells and epithelioid histiocytes (Fig. 5). Crypt abscesses might have been present (Fig. 6). The mesenteric nodes would have shown reactive hyperplasia.\\nOnce ingested, S. typhi survives gastric acid and replicates in the intestine. Within a day or two after ingestion, it gains access to the intestinal wall by invading the epithelium, without causing epithelial injury or inflammation. The bacillus enters lymph and is transported through regional lymph nodes, gaining access to blood through the thoracic duct, with primary bacteremia generally occurring on the second day. The bacillus is removed from the circulation by the reticuloendothelial system in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. The bacillus also survives at these sites and replicates within macrophages from the second to the seventh day. During this time, the Peyer's patches are a site of active bacillary replication, resulting in lymphoid hyperplasia. The release of bacilli into the circulation from about the 7th to the 14th day results in fever, chills, and malaise. Bacilli are released in bile and are found in feces. Within the intestine, the hyperplasia may subside during the third week, or ulceration, necrosis, and perforation may occur, usually around the 21st day, with a secondary release of bacilli into the circulation. Healing with scarring may take place. The systemic disease may also subside or recur in waves. Treatment with antibiotics in this patient may have allowed the intestine to heal without perforation, although this complication occurs in only approximately 30 percent of untreated cases.\\nThe pathophysiology of typhoid fever continues to be elucidated. One of the questions that remain unanswered is how the organism invades the epithelium. Studies of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene have suggested that in societies with high rates of bacterial infection, mutations in the gene may confer a survival advantage by increasing resistance to bacterial invasion. These studies, which examined S. typhi and S. typhimurium, showed that cells expressing the wild-type CFTR gene were much more vulnerable to invasion by S. typhi than cells expressing the cystic fibrosis mutation.²⁷\\nStudies of virulence factors in salmonella species have also increased our understanding of how the bacillus survives within macrophages and how it continues to replicate.²⁸⁻³⁰\\nDR. BASGOZ: We administered a fluoroquinolone orally. The patient's temperature began to fall within two days and was normal by the time of his discharge.\\nDR. FARMER: What happened to the cerebral lesion detected on the cranial CT scan? There are very few reports of metastatic brain lesions in cases of typhoid fever.\\nDR. BASGOZ: By the time we saw the patient, his neurologic status was normal. His headache, as well as all his other symptoms, resolved within hours after his temperature began to fall. After reviewing the CT scan with the neuroradiologists, we concluded that he did not have an infectious focus in the central nervous system. We administered the oral antibiotic therapy for a longer period than usual, but we did not investigate the possibility of a cerebral lesion during his hospital stay. The patient's primary care physician is aware of the findings, and we plan to obtain another scan on an outpatient basis.\\nDR. ROBERT LAGER: Does the patient's grade 1 systolic murmur suggest the possibility that he had endocarditis?\\nDR. FARMER: The murmur was probably only a flow murmur associated with the high temperature. Endocarditis due to S. typhi infection does occur but is rare. The murmur would merit reevaluation if the patient were to have bacteremia in the future. The reservoir for this organism is usually the gallbladder, which often contains stones.\\nWith regard to therapy, in Haiti, as in much of the world, my colleagues and I have long treated typhoid fever with chloramphenicol. The drug is bacteriostatic but effective. However, there are several problems associated with its use. One is that it causes two types of anemia: a dose-related form, which is common, and aplastic anemia, which is quite rare (1 case per 36,000 patients treated with chloramphenicol). A more serious problem is the development of resistance to chloramphenicol. Although multidrug-resistant strains of S. typhi are uncommon in the United States, they have been found in Pakistan, India, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.\\nPatients with typhoid fever may have a slow defervescence after receiving chloramphenicol, but we do not become concerned about the drug's effectiveness until the fourth or fifth day of therapy. Although my colleagues and I have not yet collected data in Haiti on the use of fluoroquinolones to treat enteric fever due to S. typhi, the administration of these agents appears to result in a more prompt defervescence than the administration of chloramphenicol.\\nIn fact, fluoroquinolones are probably the optimal therapy for typhoid fever at this time for a number of reasons. First, they are bactericidal. Second, they are easy to administer, and unless the patient has a perforation, they are well absorbed. Finally, they appear to be much more effective than other drugs in clearing the carrier state associated with S. typhi. In a large study in Peru, Gotuzzo and Carrillo³¹ reported a cure rate of almost 100 percent.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "{'query': \"A 28-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of gram-negative sepsis.\\nThe patient had been in excellent health until three weeks earlier, when malaise developed. Ten days before admission, he attended a wedding. The next day he had fatigue, anorexia, and malaise, which waxed and waned. Four days before admission, his temperature rose to 40.6°C, with rigors, sweats, and difficulty concentrating. Two days later, the patient had a severe occipital headache.\\nOne day before admission, the patient came to the emergency department at this hospital. The temperature was 38.7°C, the pulse was 120, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 135/80 mm Hg. The results of a physical examination and radiographic studies of the chest were normal. The results of laboratory tests are shown in Tables 1 and 2. A lumbar puncture was performed (Table 3). A specimen of cerebrospinal fluid and two specimens of blood were sent for culture, and the patient was discharged with a prescription for oxycodone-acetaminophen.\\nOn the following day, the blood cultures yielded gram-negative rods. The cerebrospinal fluid culture was sterile. The patient was contacted, and he returned to the hospital.\\nThe patient worked in a sedentary professional capacity. He resided in a city and had a monogamous relationship with a woman; his household included a healthy cat. He frequently had meals at restaurants.\\nHe had not traveled recently outside the United States and had no known exposure to sick persons. He had passed only two stools during the five days before admission. The patient had no risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and there was no history of inflammatory bowel disease, constipation, abdominal pain, stiffness of the neck, or visual changes or other neurologic symptoms.\\nThe temperature was 38.2°C, the pulse was 92, and the respirations were 24. The blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient had shaking chills. No rash, lymphadenopathy, or scleral injection was found. A grade 1 systolic murmur was present along the left sternal border. Abdominal examination revealed mild, diffuse tenderness without organomegaly. The results of a rectal examination were normal, and a stool specimen was negative for occult blood.\\nThe urine was positive for bilirubin (+), urobilinogen (+), and protein (++); the sediment contained 2 red cells, 2 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power field. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 97, with nonspecific T-wave abnormalities. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 1), obtained after the oral and intravenous administration of contrast material, showed thickening of the wall of the terminal ileum and an area of clumped mesenteric lymph nodes, more than 5 mm in the short axis, in the right lower quadrant. A cranial CT scan (Fig. 2), obtained before the intravenous injection of contrast material, showed an area of relative hypodensity, 1 cm in diameter, anterolateral to the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle superiorly. Additional punctate areas of hypodensity involved the forceps major region bilaterally.\\nTreatment with intravenous saline solution and gentamicin was begun. On the second hospital day, the shaking chills and headache persisted. The temperature was 40.2°C, the pulse was 92, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 115/70 mm Hg.\\nA diagnostic report was received.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. PAUL E. FARMER*: What disease might account for all the features of this man's illness? His clinical presentation, which included a sustained fever, headache, difficulty concentrating, malaise, abdominal pain, and relative bradycardia in the setting of a temperature of 40.2°C, differs from that of typical sepsis, which is characterized by an abrupt onset, hypotension, and tachycardia. Indeed, several features of this man's illness suggest enteric fever due to Salmonella typhi.\\nAt the Clinique Bon Sauveur in Cange, Haiti, where I spend half my clinical time, my colleagues and I diagnose typhoid fever on a daily basis. In 1993, we collected data on a total of 286 patients with this disease.¹ The clinical manifestations of typhoid fever in these patients are shown in Table 4.\\nMost patients with this disease have abdominal pain. S. typhi has a predilection for Peyer's patches in the distal small bowel, and ileal perforation is one of the fatal complications. In an important treatise on typhoid fever published in 1873, William Budd² stated that ileal ulcers were pathognomonic for typhoid. According to Budd, “morbid changes — always present in this disease, and never present in any other” are found in the distal ileum, where a “certain number of Peyer's patches, or of the isolated follicles, as the case may be, have acquired a great increase of thickness, and stand out in relief on the internal surface of the gut.”² In guinea-pig models, S. typhimurium attaches only to what appear to be specific receptors in the microvilli of the distal small bowel.³\\nMay we review the radiologic studies?\\nDR. PATRICK RAO: A selected axial image from the abdominal CT scan (Fig. 1), obtained after oral and intravenous administration of contrast material, shows marked thickening of the wall of the terminal ileum; pencil-thin and clumped oval soft-tissue densities, a finding consistent with the presence of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes that drain the terminal ileum, the appendix, and the cecum; and a distal ileal loop with an obviously thickened wall. An axial image from a cranial CT examination at the level of the bodies of the lateral ventricles (Fig. 2) reveals an area of slight hypodensity, 1 cm in diameter, anterolateral to the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle.\\nDR. FARMER: Although few patients with enteric fever ever undergo abdominal CT scanning, the CT findings in this case are consistent with the presence of this disease. Once the organisms have invaded Peyer's patches, multiplication takes place in mononuclear cells. Impaired phagocytosis often allows the organisms to reach mesenteric lymph nodes on their way to the bloodstream.⁴\\nThis patient also had constipation. Although diarrhea is often associated with enteric fever, in our series, constipation was more common, as others have also observed.⁵\\nBecause of the patient's severe headache and difficulty concentrating, both a lumbar puncture and cranial CT studies were performed. The findings in the cerebrospinal fluid were unimpressive, but the slightly hypodense area on the CT scan could have been a metastatic brain lesion⁶ or even a mycotic aneurysm. S. typhi is a leading cause of these lesions in developing countries. Brain biopsies are almost never performed, however, in cases of enteric fever.\\nOther forms of central nervous system involvement are more common than focal lesions. The term “typhoid” comes from the Greek word typhus, meaning “cloud” or “mist,” and Hippocrates used it to describe the clouded mental status of patients with unremitting fevers. In 1873, Budd noted that most patients showed their malady by “beginning to droop.”² One of the first large studies dealing with mental changes in patients with typhoid fever was reported by James Jackson,⁷ a contemporary of Budd, who analyzed 303 cases in patients seen at Massachusetts General Hospital between 1821 and 1835. Over a third of the patients had delirium, and many others presented with somnolence, deafness, or “watchfulness.” The pathogenesis of these alterations is unclear, but they may be unique to typhoid fever, rather than merely a nonspecific consequence of gram-negative sepsis.\\nIn my experience in Haiti, most patients present with headache, and mental-status changes are more common than rose spots. Children are listless and dull; adults may seem indifferent. More severe manifestations at presentation range from florid psychosis to coma.⁸⁻¹⁰\\nRelative bradycardia, which this patient had on the second hospital day, may be associated with typhoid fever.¹¹ Thirty-six percent of the patients in our series presented with a heart rate that was slow in relation to the height of their fever curves, a finding similar to that reported by others. Nonspecific T-wave abnormalities were also noted in this patient. Although at the clinic in Haiti, my colleagues and I do not perform electrocardiography in young febrile patients unless we suspect the presence of rheumatic fever or diphtheria, these abnormalities are the most common electrocardiographic changes reported in the literature on enteric fever.¹²,¹³\\nThe tracking of fever curves is a lost art, in part because effective chemotherapy is administered once the diagnosis of typhoid fever has been made. This patient's high, unremitting fever, however, is typical of typhoid fever. In much of the late 19th-century literature, “continued fever” is synonymous with typhoid fever.\\nThis patient did not have rose spots, a feature that is absent in 60 to 70 percent of patients with enteric fever. Rose spots, seen most often on the trunk, are due to capillary atony and are usually evanescent, sometimes lasting only a few hours. Cultures of these lesions may yield S. typhi.¹⁴,¹⁵ We seldom see rose spots in Haiti, but they can be difficult to detect in patients with dark skin.\\nFeatures of enteric fever still commonly seen in Haiti, such as epistaxis, are also seen in other regions where access to health care is poor. Joint involvement and ileal perforation are late complications and are more likely to develop in patients who have not received effective therapy. The high rate of catastrophic complications of this disease in Haiti reflects the large number of untreated patients. Although splenomegaly is a characteristic finding in Haiti, its absence in cases reported in the literature during the past two decades may reflect improved access to therapy.¹⁶\\nIn short, many clinical features of this case suggest the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and the laboratory data are consistent with it. Leukocytosis is unusual in patients with established enteric fever; mild leukopenia is more common. Anemia is often reported, especially where helminthiasis is endemic. In one large series of ileal perforations complicating enteric fever in rural Haiti, ascaris worms were often found in the peritoneum.¹⁷ Elevations of both aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase levels are seen in most cases of enteric fever, as is transient proteinuria without azotemia.\\nWith a broader differential diagnosis based on the clinical presentation, the first diseases to consider are paratyphoid fevers due to nontyphoidal serotypes of salmonella. Although several serotypes, including S. paratyphi A and B (S. schottmuelleri) and S. paratyphi C (S. hirschfeldii), may cause enteric fever, it is usually milder than that due to S. typhi.¹⁸,¹⁹ S. choleraesuis and S. anatum cause bacteremia with localized infection but seldom cause ileitis.²⁰ In the United States, the incidence of enteric fever due to nontyphoidal salmonella strains seems to be increasing, whereas the number of reported cases of typhoid fever remains small.²¹\\nYersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis may cause mesenteric lymphadenitis, with abdominal pain and fever, but positive blood cultures are unusual. Similarly, dysentery due to shigella may begin in the distal small bowel, but widespread colonic involvement accounts for the typical symptoms, and the organism is also rarely isolated from blood. Uncomplicated appendicitis generally does not lead to gram-negative bacteremia. Gram-negative sepsis due to bowel perforation in a patient with no history of trauma suggests the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, but this patient had no history of inflammatory bowel disease. Tuberculous ileitis, like Crohn's disease, may be associated with gram-negative bacteremia in the event of perforation, but it would probably be preceded by an indolent enteropathy, which is not suggested by this patient's history. Finally, his headache and fever suggest the presence of meningitis, but it was ruled out by lumbar puncture. In Haiti, fever and any neuropsychiatric impairment require that cerebral malaria be ruled out or that the patient receive empirical treatment for it. Malaria is not a consideration in this patient, since he had not traveled to a region where malaria is endemic.\\nGram-negative bacteremia, which is unusual in otherwise healthy young adults in the United States, is often due to pyelonephritis, but in this patient's age group, the disorder is more likely to affect women than men. The results of urinalysis, although abnormal, did not suggest that the patient had an infection of the upper urinary tract. Young adults with gram-negative bacteremia usually have a predisposing factor, such as neutropenia and cecitis after chemotherapy, a breach in the integrity of the bowel due to trauma or inflammatory bowel disease, or asplenia leading to difficulty clearing encapsulated organisms. This patient had no history of trauma or cancer, however, and he had an intact spleen. There is no reason to suspect HIV infection, which is associated with bacteremia caused by salmonella. Salmonella commonly causes bacteremia in persons with sickle cell anemia and other diseases associated with hemolysis, including malaria and bartonellosis. This patient, however, had a robust hematocrit and a normal-sized spleen on CT scanning.\\nWhat are the epidemiologic and bacteriologic features of gram-negative bacteremia in a Boston teaching hospital? Of over 5000 blood isolates cultured in 1990 and 1991 at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the majority were gram-positive organisms. Most of the gram-negative organisms were enteric flora (Table 5). Of these pathogens, only salmonella species are likely to cause the syndrome seen in this patient. Over the past decade, Brigham and Women's Hospital has had only 10 cases of bacteriologically confirmed enteric fever. Although it is now rare in the United States, enteric fever has not been eradicated. Since it is reportable, information on recent trends is available from the Massachusetts State Laboratory. Only 20 cases were reported to the laboratory in 1992, 34 in 1993, 19 in 1994, 31 in 1995, and 18 in 1996.\\nAccording to Jackson's study, S. typhi bacteremia was probably once the most common gram-negative bacteremia documented at Massachusetts General Hospital. It is exceedingly rare today. Half to two thirds of patients in the United States with confirmed disease due to S. typhi have a history of recent travel to areas where it is endemic,²² but a substantial minority of cases can be linked to improper handling of food. Various well-known cases of salmonellosis have been associated with consumption of food at picnics, consumption of potato salad, and contact with asymptomatic carriers of the organisms. One of the best-known carriers was the cook Mary Mallon (Typhoid Mary), whose asymptomatic carriage of S. typhi led to at least 51 cases of enteric fever and 3 deaths.²³ Less well known are some of the more recent outbreaks. In 1989, one cluster of 43 definite and 24 probable cases was linked to a person who had prepared about 200 liters of orange juice.²⁴ It is not clear how the patient under discussion was exposed to the organisms that caused his illness. It is difficult to be certain whether the infection began before or after the wedding he attended. It would be interesting to know more about his history of travel. Although he had not been outside the United States recently, he may have been exposed during travel a number of years earlier. In one reported case,²⁵ a patient presented with S. typhi cholecystitis and cholelithiasis 67 years after an attack of typhoid fever.\\nIn closing, I believe this patient had a typical case of a disease that is common in areas where typhoid fever due to poor sanitation remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the so-called postantibiotic era. According to international estimates, there are 12 million to 33 million cases of typhoid fever each year.²⁶ The diagnostic report in this case probably came from the microbiology laboratory, which with the help of the Massachusetts State Laboratory, probably identified the gram-negative bacillus as S. typhi.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nEnteric fever due to Salmonella typhi.\\nDR. PAUL E. FARMER’S DIAGNOSIS\\nEnteric fever due to Salmonella typhi, with the possible metastasis of lesions to the brain.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. NESLI BASGOZ: The diagnostic report contained the results of the blood culture, which grew S. typhi.\\nMS. MARGARET J. MURTAGH: The organism grew in both the aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures within 12 to 18 hours after collection. Gram's stains revealed gram-negative rods. The organism was identified as S. typhi on the basis of biochemical tests and agglutination tests that characterize the cell-wall lipopolysaccharide O antigen and the capsular polysaccharide Vi antigen. In contrast to most other salmonella species, S. typhi is easily identified with the use of commercial reagents.\\nDR. FIONA M. GRAEME-COOK: The radiologic finding of thickening of the wall of the terminal ileum with slightly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes is consistent with how this patient's small intestine would have appeared pathologically, had specimens been available.\\nThe wall of the terminal ileum would have been edematous and thickened. On the antimesenteric aspect of the luminal surface hyperplastic Peyer's patches with a maximal diameter of 5 cm would have been prominent. Pathological findings in a specimen of terminal ileum from another patient with typhoid fever (Fig. 3, 4, 5, and 6) suggest that tan, vertical ulcers might have been present in the centers of the Peyer's patches, with overlying, fibrinous exudate (Fig. 3). Microscopical examination in the region of Peyer's patches would have shown a thickened wall characterized by lymphoid hyperplasia and surface ulceration (Fig. 4), with a polymorphous infiltrate containing numerous plasma cells and epithelioid histiocytes (Fig. 5). Crypt abscesses might have been present (Fig. 6). The mesenteric nodes would have shown reactive hyperplasia.\\nOnce ingested, S. typhi survives gastric acid and replicates in the intestine. Within a day or two after ingestion, it gains access to the intestinal wall by invading the epithelium, without causing epithelial injury or inflammation. The bacillus enters lymph and is transported through regional lymph nodes, gaining access to blood through the thoracic duct, with primary bacteremia generally occurring on the second day. The bacillus is removed from the circulation by the reticuloendothelial system in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. The bacillus also survives at these sites and replicates within macrophages from the second to the seventh day. During this time, the Peyer's patches are a site of active bacillary replication, resulting in lymphoid hyperplasia. The release of bacilli into the circulation from about the 7th to the 14th day results in fever, chills, and malaise. Bacilli are released in bile and are found in feces. Within the intestine, the hyperplasia may subside during the third week, or ulceration, necrosis, and perforation may occur, usually around the 21st day, with a secondary release of bacilli into the circulation. Healing with scarring may take place. The systemic disease may also subside or recur in waves. Treatment with antibiotics in this patient may have allowed the intestine to heal without perforation, although this complication occurs in only approximately 30 percent of untreated cases.\\nThe pathophysiology of typhoid fever continues to be elucidated. One of the questions that remain unanswered is how the organism invades the epithelium. Studies of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene have suggested that in societies with high rates of bacterial infection, mutations in the gene may confer a survival advantage by increasing resistance to bacterial invasion. These studies, which examined S. typhi and S. typhimurium, showed that cells expressing the wild-type CFTR gene were much more vulnerable to invasion by S. typhi than cells expressing the cystic fibrosis mutation.²⁷\\nStudies of virulence factors in salmonella species have also increased our understanding of how the bacillus survives within macrophages and how it continues to replicate.²⁸⁻³⁰\\nDR. BASGOZ: We administered a fluoroquinolone orally. The patient's temperature began to fall within two days and was normal by the time of his discharge.\\nDR. FARMER: What happened to the cerebral lesion detected on the cranial CT scan? There are very few reports of metastatic brain lesions in cases of typhoid fever.\\nDR. BASGOZ: By the time we saw the patient, his neurologic status was normal. His headache, as well as all his other symptoms, resolved within hours after his temperature began to fall. After reviewing the CT scan with the neuroradiologists, we concluded that he did not have an infectious focus in the central nervous system. We administered the oral antibiotic therapy for a longer period than usual, but we did not investigate the possibility of a cerebral lesion during his hospital stay. The patient's primary care physician is aware of the findings, and we plan to obtain another scan on an outpatient basis.\\nDR. ROBERT LAGER: Does the patient's grade 1 systolic murmur suggest the possibility that he had endocarditis?\\nDR. FARMER: The murmur was probably only a flow murmur associated with the high temperature. Endocarditis due to S. typhi infection does occur but is rare. The murmur would merit reevaluation if the patient were to have bacteremia in the future. The reservoir for this organism is usually the gallbladder, which often contains stones.\\nWith regard to therapy, in Haiti, as in much of the world, my colleagues and I have long treated typhoid fever with chloramphenicol. The drug is bacteriostatic but effective. However, there are several problems associated with its use. One is that it causes two types of anemia: a dose-related form, which is common, and aplastic anemia, which is quite rare (1 case per 36,000 patients treated with chloramphenicol). A more serious problem is the development of resistance to chloramphenicol. Although multidrug-resistant strains of S. typhi are uncommon in the United States, they have been found in Pakistan, India, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.\\nPatients with typhoid fever may have a slow defervescence after receiving chloramphenicol, but we do not become concerned about the drug's effectiveness until the fourth or fifth day of therapy. Although my colleagues and I have not yet collected data in Haiti on the use of fluoroquinolones to treat enteric fever due to S. typhi, the administration of these agents appears to result in a more prompt defervescence than the administration of chloramphenicol.\\nIn fact, fluoroquinolones are probably the optimal therapy for typhoid fever at this time for a number of reasons. First, they are bactericidal. Second, they are easy to administer, and unless the patient has a perforation, they are well absorbed. Finally, they appear to be much more effective than other drugs in clearing the carrier state associated with S. typhi. In a large study in Peru, Gotuzzo and Carrillo³¹ reported a cure rate of almost 100 percent.\", 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"Here's a step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the most likely diagnosis, grounded in the provided context:\\n\\n**1.

Be concise and grounded.\\n\\n# PATIENT CASE\\nA 75-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of weakness and a tendency to fall.\\nEight months earlier, a temporal-artery biopsy, with negative results, had been performed elsewhere because of frequent headaches and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain at that time showed enhancement by gadolinium of the cerebellar tentorium, which was more prominent on the right side, in the posterior middle cranial fossa and posterior fossa, without mass effect or evidence of obstruction. Soon thereafter, esophagogastroduodenoscopic and colonoscopic examinations revealed active gastritis, for which the patient received omeprazole. Two months later, her memory deteriorated, and she began to dress carelessly. Three months before admission, she experienced vague dizziness and had a tendency to fall; she began to walk with a cane. Two weeks before admission, she fell in the bathtub and remained there all night because of generalized weakness. One day before admission, she again fell, striking her occiput and lying on the floor for two hours because of diffuse weakness. She was brought to this hospital.\\nThe patient had had endometrial cancer 16 years before admission, which was treated with a hysterectomy and radiotherapy. Six years later, a partial colectomy with a colostomy was performed because of colonic carcinoma.\\nThe temperature was 36.4°C, the pulse was 61, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 165/85 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was somnolent. A grade 3 systolic murmur was heard along the sternal border, and it radiated to the axilla. A functioning right-sided colostomy was present. On neurologic examination, she was oriented to the city and knew she was in a hospital, which she could not identify. Her attention span was short. Her ability to name objects was preserved, but she could not recall three objects after five minutes. There was fine nystagmus on right lateral gaze. Hearing was impaired bilaterally. A slight left-sided facial droop was noted. There was no other evidence of cranial-nerve dysfunction. Muscle strength was slightly reduced in the left arm and leg. Fine finger movements became smaller when sustained. The patient held on to furniture while walking and had a tendency to lean to the left. Retropulsion was present. She was unstable on standing. She refused testing of the deep-tendon reflexes. Bilateral grasp reflexes were observed; the plantar responses were flexor.\\nThe urine was normal. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 60, with delayed R-wave progression in leads V₁ through V₅. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain (Fig. 1) revealed thickening and increased density of the tentorium and of the dura overlying the left cerebellar hemisphere, with dense enhancement. The right lateral and third ventricles were dilated, and transependymal edema surrounded the right lateral ventricle; no obstructive lesion was identified. Omeprazole was administered, and phenytoin sodium was subsequently added.\\nOn the second hospital day, a gadolinium-enhanced MRI study of the brain (Fig. 2 and 3) revealed thickening of the tentorium and left cerebellar dura that was isointense on T₁-weighted images, hypointense on T₂-weighted images, and partly enhanced. The right lateral and third ventricles were dilated, with edema surrounding the right lateral ventricle. T₂-weighted images showed hyperintense foci in the pons, right thalamus, and periventricular white matter. No flow void was detected in the infraclinoid portion of the left internal carotid artery. A lumbar puncture was performed (Table 3). A CT scan of the thorax (Fig. 4) showed patchy ground-glass opacities throughout both lungs and subpleural nodular opacities, 2 to 3 mm in diameter, in the superior segment of the left lower lobe and in the posterior right middle lobe, with calcified precarinal and subcarinal lymph nodes, 5 to 10 mm in diameter. A CT scan of the abdomen, obtained after the administration of contrast material, showed punctate calcifications throughout the liver and spleen, gallstones, and bilateral renal cysts.\\nOn the sixth hospital day, laboratory tests were performed (Table 2). On the 10th day, the patient became more disoriented and lethargic, required assistance to stand, and had an ataxic gait. The results of a tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative, 5 TU) were strongly positive.\\nOn the 13th hospital day, the patient was stuporous. She awakened only briefly in response to noxious stimulation and moved the right arm and leg more vigorously than the left. All deep-tendon reflexes were diminished. The results of a urinalysis were normal. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 4). Radiographs of the chest were unremarkable.\\nOn the next day, a ventriculostomy was performed, and vancomycin was administered intravenously. The cerebrospinal fluid was examined (Table 3). Microscopical examination of biopsy specimens of the meninges (Fig. 5) showed granulomatous pachymeningitis, with numerous ill-defined collections of epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without necrosis. Special stains showed no mycobacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms. The leptomeninges contained scattered inflammatory cells; cerebellar tissue in the specimen was normal. During the next few days, the patient became more alert and communicative. On the 17th day, laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). All culture specimens were negative.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. WILLIAM J. SCHWARTZ*: This woman’s illness was heralded by headaches, then progressed indolently over a period of eight months to affect both her mind and her gait. By the time of admission, an encephalopathy had developed that was characterized by clouded consciousness, postural instability, diminished hearing with asymmetric nystagmus, and a left hemiparesis.\\nThe first question is whether this complicated clinical picture can be attributed to a single pathologic entity. I believe that it can, and my working hypothesis will be that the patient’s clinical presentation represents the neurologic manifestation of a process that generally affects the lungs.\\nMay we review the imaging studies?\\nDR. PAMELA W. SCHAEFER: On a CT scan of the head obtained after the administration of contrast material (Fig. 1), the tentorium appears thickened, with dense enhancement. An MRI scan (Fig. 2 and 3) shows that the tentorium and the dura overlying the left cerebellar hemisphere and part of the right cerebellar hemisphere are isointense in relation to the brain on T₁-weighted images and hypointense on T₂-weighted images, with dense enhancement after the administration of gadolinium. There is no leptomeningeal enhancement. The right lateral and third ventricles are dilated, with edema surrounding the right lateral ventricle. There is no evidence of sinusitis. A CT scan of the chest (Fig. 4) shows bilateral, diffuse, patchy ground-glass opacities; calcified mediastinal nodes, 1 cm in diameter; and scattered, tiny subpleural nodules.\\nDR. SCHWARTZ: Hydrocephalus and meningitis can account for the neurologic findings in this case. In view of the evidence of transependymal edema and sulcal effacement, the marked dilatation of the right lateral ventricle must reflect an increase in intraventricular pressure rather than a loss of hemispheric tissue. Features of the patient’s encephalopathy are consistent with increased intracranial pressure, and the left hemiparesis is probably due to compromise of the contralateral corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts in the periventricular white matter of the right hemisphere. Meningitis might be a factor in the patient’s hearing loss, but support for this interpretation requires more information about whether the deficit is conductive, sensorineural, or both.\\nAlthough it seems certain that the meningitis caused the hydrocephalus, the causal mechanism is unclear. An initial consideration is a blockage of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid by leptomeningeal inflammation at the level of the thickened tentorium, at the base of the brain, or at both sites, but the normal sizes of the fourth ventricle and aqueduct argue against this explanation. Moreover, an extraventricular obstruction would not account for the asymmetry of the lateral ventricles. If the asymmetry had been partly congenital or due to a previous injury, it should have been seen on the MRI scan obtained eight months before admission. Experimental and clinical evidence has implicated impaired cerebral venous drainage in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. Since the periosteal and meningeal layers of the dura split to form venous sinuses, perhaps inflammation of the tentorium caused narrowing or thrombosis of the straight sinus, but the MRI scan does not show either abnormality. Also, there is now a general consensus that venous insufficiency is not an important mechanism in the development of hydrocephalus.¹\\nAnother explanation of the hydrocephalus is based on the concept that ventricular enlargement is partly determined by the difference in pressure between the ventricle and the overlying subarachnoid compartment.¹ If meningeal exudate were to obliterate the subarachnoid space over the right hemisphere, the resulting elevation of the transmural pressure gradient across the right cerebral mantle might contribute to right ventricular dilatation, but again, the MRI scan does not show this change, and the cortical subarachnoid spaces appear normal. I am left with the view that there must be an invisible intraventricular obstruction above the aqueduct and around the right foramen of Monro. The finding of normal ventricular fluid on ventriculostomy is not surprising, since the dilated ventricle from which the fluid was obtained is proximal to (i.e., upstream of) the hypothesized block. Intraoperative instillation of a nonionic contrast agent into the right lateral ventricle might have helped delineate the anatomical features of the hydrocephalus.\\nThe finding of granulomatous pachymeningitis with relative sparing of the leptomeninges in this case allows me to focus on a smaller differential diagnosis of chronic meningitis. That finding, along with the normal appearance and flow-cytometric features of the lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid, dissuade me from strongly considering neoplastic meningeal seeding, which may appear as a pachymeningitis on MRI.² This case highlights the excellent diagnostic results obtained when meningeal biopsies are performed in regions showing enhancement with gadolinium on MRI scans.³\\nTuberculous meningitis is a primary consideration in any patient with granulomatous meningitis, pulmonary disease, and a positive tuberculin test.⁴,⁵ The disorder follows bacillemia, which originates either in a primary tubercular lesion or in one that is reactivated in association with aging, immunosuppression, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. The characteristic features of active tuberculosis may not accompany the meningitis, and chest radiographs are normal in over half of affected adults. The typical pattern of mononuclear pleocytosis with elevated protein and reduced glucose levels is found in only a minority of patients; as in this case, the protein level is less than 100 mg per deciliter, and the glucose level is more than 45 mg per deciliter (2.5 mmol per liter) in a quarter to a third of infected adults. Hyponatremia due to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone is found in some but not all patients. Smears and cultures of cerebrospinal fluid have a low sensitivity for identifying the tubercle bacillus, but the sensitivity can be increased to more than 80 percent by meticulous attention to technique, including the collection of multiple specimens of 10 to 15 ml and examination of up to 500 highpower fields.⁷ Since this type of examination requires about 30 minutes, the laboratory must be informed that the diagnosis is being considered. In this case, cultures were still negative on the 17th hospital day, but this is not surprising, since Mycobacterium tuberculosis takes about 20 times as long to generate as most other bacteria, and detectable growth in culture may take up to 8 weeks. Promising new tests based on immunologic techniques and the polymerase chain reaction offer hope for more rapid confirmation.\\nSeveral features of this patient’s illness, however, raise serious doubts about the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The duration of symptoms for eight months is not characteristic of tuberculous meningitis. The median duration of symptoms before presentation ranges from two to four weeks and rarely exceeds a few months; untreated patients usually die within eight weeks. The absence of fever is also atypical. Fever occurs at some time during the course of the illness in more than 80 percent of patients, and in some series, fever is more frequent than an alteration of consciousness.⁶,⁸ Although hydrocephalus is the most common neuroradiologic abnormality, it is usually the communicating type, and other findings, such as tuberculomas and infarcts in the distribution of the medial striae and thalamoperforate arteries, are often present. Leptomeningeal enhancement of the basal cisterns is the usual pattern, and a hypertrophic pachymeningitis is rare.¹⁰-¹² The erythrocyte sedimentation rate varies but is often only slightly elevated; this patient’s level is unexpectedly high, especially in view of the normal chest film. Finally, there was no evidence of upper-lobe cavitation or endobronchial disease on the CT scan of the chest. The combination of these atypical findings leads me to consider alternative diagnoses.\\nOther infections can cause granulomatous meningitis.¹³ Although nontuberculous mycobacteria usually infect patients with chronic lung disorders or depressed cellular immunity, disease caused by M. avium complex can occur in apparently normal persons and can occasionally cause meningitis. Such patients, however, characteristically present with a productive cough and abnormal chest films. The deep mycoses may cause a meningoencephalitis associated with a mild, resolving, or asymptomatic pulmonary infection. The most common type of fungal meningitis is cryptococcal, even in immunocompetent patients, but the test for serum cryptococcal antigen, which has a sensitivity of at least 90 percent, was negative in this case. Coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis rarely disseminate to the nervous system. Blastomycosis generally infects the brain and meninges late in the course of advanced disease. Aspergillus, mucor, and Pseudallescheria boydii are not usually found in immunocompetent persons. Among bacteria, brucella can cause a chronic granulomatous meningitis, but it is typically associated with fever, constitutional symptoms, and a history of exposure to infected animal tissues or products. Finally, the spirochetes Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi may cause lesions that are predominantly or even entirely meningeal, but infection with either of these organisms would not explain the findings on the CT scan of the chest. Also, the negative serologic tests of cerebrospinal fluid and serum provide no diagnostic support, although their sensitivities are not optimal.\\nNeurologic involvement occurs in 5 percent of patients with sarcoidosis and is the presenting manifestation in about half these patients.¹⁴-¹⁶ Findings include cranial neuropathies and occasionally pachymeningitis. Nevertheless, it would be unusual for hydrocephalus and aseptic meningitis to be the sole manifestations of neurosarcoidosis. Also, only 10 to 15 percent of patients present with pulmonary infiltrates in the absence of lymphadenopathy. Finally, this patient’s relatively advanced age, extremely high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and normal angiotensin-converting-enzyme level in association with an active pulmonary process make the diagnosis of sarcoidosis unlikely.\\nWegener’s granulomatosis is a serious consideration in this case.¹⁷ A median interval of 15 months from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis has been reported. Although over 90 percent of patients have some type of airway disease, the initial manifestation of the disorder may not occur in the nose, sinuses, or lungs. Abnormalities on radiographs of the chest include infiltrates, nodules, and hemorrhages, reflecting the complex underlying pathological lesions characterized by necrosis, granulomas composed of palisading histiocytes, and vasculitis.¹⁸ In about a third of cases, the pulmonary lesions detected radiographically are asymptomatic. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is almost always markedly elevated, and hypergammaglobulinemia may be present. The discovery that antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are present in patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis has led to early diagnosis of the disease and improved monitoring of its progression and treatment. An immunofluorescent pattern of diffuse cytoplasmic staining (c-ANCA) has a sensitivity of at least 90 percent and a specificity approaching 99 percent for diagnosing generalized Wegener’s granulomatosis. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has demonstrated the presence of an antibody that in most cases is directed against a 29-kd serine proteinase (proteinase 3). This immunologic reaction may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease by inducing neutrophil degranulation.¹⁹\\nNeurologic complications of Wegener’s granulomatosis occur in 20 to 50 percent of cases, although they are not usually the initial signs of the illness.²⁰,²¹ Mechanisms of nervous system involvement include invasion from contiguous structures, independent formation of intracranial granulomas, and vasculitis. The most frequent clinical disorder is peripheral neuropathy, generally in the form of mononeuropathy multiplex. Common symptoms include headache, which is usually due to sinusitis or orbital disease, and hearing loss due to otitis media or to vasculitic or granulomatous involvement of the auditory nerve. Individual cranial neuropathies and cerebrovascular events also occur. Less than 10 percent of patients with neurologic manifestations have meningitis. In two case reports,²²,²³ the authors noted thickening with enhancement of the tentorium and dura similar to that seen in this case. Dural biopsies in these cases showed granulomatous pachymeningitis consistent with the diagnosis of Wegener’s granulomatosis, which was subsequently confirmed by positive ANCA tests. Other authors have emphasized meningeal involvement²⁴-²⁷ and the diagnostic value of ANCA tests of cerebrospinal fluid.²⁸ In the present case, which is characterized by a granulomatous pachymeningitis, a very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and asymptomatic pulmonary opacities and nodules, none of the findings are inconsistent with the diagnosis of Wegener’s granulomatosis.\\nIn addition to Wegener’s granulomatosis, however, several other immune-related granulomatous disorders that involve the central nervous system should be considered.²⁹,³⁰ Isolated granulomatous angiitis is manifested as an acute or subacute multifocal encephalopathy and affects small parenchymal and leptomeningeal vessels; extracranial vasculitis is unusual, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is often normal. Forms of systemic necrotizing vasculitis that involve the nervous system include polyarteritis nodosa and the Churg-Strauss syndrome. Neurologic manifestations of polyarteritis nodosa occur late in the course of systemic disease, and asthma and hypereosinophilia are defining features of the Churg-Strauss syndrome. Peripheral neuropathy is the most common neurologic complication in both disorders. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare disease of the lungs and skin characterized by angiocentric and angiodestructive infiltrates of atypical lymphocytes and plasma cells, which sometimes progress to full-blown lymphoma.³¹,³² Cranial neuropathies and necrotic mass lesions in the cortex or brain stem occur in about 25 percent of cases of lymphomatoid granulomatosis and may be initial features.³³ However, severe respiratory insufficiency and abnormalities on chest radiographs are characteristic of this disorder, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually normal or only slightly elevated, and neither giant cells nor discrete palisading granulomas are seen. Rheumatoid disease may cause a meningoencephalopathy, with vasculitis and rheumatoid nodules typically found in the dura,³⁴ but this complication usually occurs in patients with a positive test for rheumatoid factor and clinically established rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, none of these disorders fit the clinical picture in this case.\\nIdiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis¹²,³⁵-³⁷ is a rare disorder characterized on neuroimaging by evidence of thickening and enhancement of the dura, especially of the tentorium and falx. It is typically a chronic disease and is manifested most often by headache, ataxia, and cranial-nerve palsies. Dural granulomas are seen in 10 percent of cases. I could find only one case in which the patient was tested for ANCA, and the results were negative.³⁵ It would be premature to make the diagnosis of idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis in this case, and it would not explain the pulmonary findings.\\nTuberculous meningitis is the diagnosis I would have been anxious not to overlook, and in view of the patient’s age and her altered mental status on admission, I would have initiated antituberculous therapy immediately while looking for conclusive evidence of this or an alternative diagnosis. Empirical antituberculous therapy does not compromise the yield of positive cerebrospinal fluid smears or cultures if specimens are collected within the first week of treatment.\\nNevertheless, for the reasons I have outlined, I believe Wegener’s granulomatosis is the correct diagnosis, and the next diagnostic procedure should have been an ANCA test on the serum, with the hope of avoiding a lung biopsy. It is important to confirm this diagnosis, since prompt treatment with prednisone and cyclophosphamide results in marked improvement or partial remission in over 90 percent of cases.¹⁸\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nTuberculosis or Wegener's granulomatosis.\\nDR. WILLIAM J. SCHWARTZ'S DIAGNOSIS\\nWegener's granulomatosis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. JOHN L. NILES: The diagnostic procedure was serologic testing for ANCA. Indirect immunofluorescence testing revealed a perinuclear pattern of staining (p-ANCA). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to the neutrophil cytoplasmic protein myeloperoxidase was positive at a titer of 128 U per milliliter (normal value, less than 2.8). A test for antibodies to the neutrophil cytoplasmic protein proteinase 3 was negative. Antibodies to proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase are highly specific markers for the spectrum of diseases with vasculitis that includes Wegener’s granulomatosis, microscopical polyangiitis, the Churg-Strauss syndrome, and primary necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis.³⁸-⁴⁰ The biopsy findings, together with the presence of antimyeloperoxidase antibodies, are diagnostic of Wegener’s granulomatosis.\\nSeveral assays for the detection of ANCA have been described. Indirect immunofluorescence testing is performed by staining neutrophils for the presence of one of two patterns: c-ANCA or p-ANCA. Antigen-specific immunoassays for the detection of antibodies to proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase are performed with the use of immunofluorescence. The c-ANCA pattern of staining is closely correlated with the presence of antibodies to proteinase 3. Antibodies to myeloperoxidase are among several autoantibodies that produce the p-ANCA pattern. Only the findings of c-ANCA due to antibodies to proteinase 3 and p-ANCA due to antibodies to myeloperoxidase are specific for a spectrum of vasculitic syndromes that I have mentioned.⁴¹-⁴³\\nThese syndromes have long been known to be related. When there is renal involvement, it is generally in the form of a pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis. Wegener’s granulomatosis has been described as a variant of polyarteritis nodosa; the Churg-Strauss syndrome has been considered a variant of Wegener’s granulomatosis, and pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis limited to the kidneys has even been called “renal-limited Wegener’s granulomatosis.” The clinical and histologic features of these syndromes overlap, and the features in an individual patient may evolve from those characteristic of one syndrome into those characteristic of another. Although earlier studies suggested that Wegener’s granulomatosis is specifically correlated with the presence of antibodies to proteinase 3,⁴⁴,⁴⁵ more recent reports have indicated that some patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis have antimyeloperoxidase antibodies.⁴²,⁴⁶\\nThe sensitivity of ANCA tests for diagnosing this spectrum of diseases is more than 90 percent when systemic disease is present,⁴¹ but when the disease is localized and no renal involvement is evident, the sensitivity is lower.⁴²,⁴⁵ The specificity of ANCA testing depends on how the assays are performed. Antigen-specific immunoassays performed together with immunofluorescence testing appear to provide the best results. With the techniques used at this hospital, the specificity of the assays has been more than 99 percent⁴¹,⁴³ and even higher when the titer of antibodies to proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase is high, as in this case.\\nThe positive predictive value of ANCA assays also depends on the prevalence or prior probability of disease in the group of patients being tested. The pretest probability of Wegener’s granulomatosis in this case was at least moderate, if not high. Even a pretest probability of only 10 percent, if combined with the high ANCA titer, would yield a predictive value of more than 97 percent. Together with the granulomatous features of the dural-biopsy specimen and the absence of the discrete tubercle-like granulomas that are characteristic of tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, the findings were considered diagnostic of Wegener's granulomatosis.\\nDR. MICHAEL A. PANZARA: The patient was initially treated presumptively for tuberculosis with isoniazid and three other drugs while we continued the diagnostic workup. Once the ANCA titer was reported to be positive, the patient received intravenous methylprednisolone as well as cyclophosphamide. Treatment with isoniazid was continued because of the positive tuberculin test. She was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation hospital while receiving prednisone and cyclophosphamide, and her condition has subsequently continued to improve. She is now ambulatory and living independently at a level of functioning very close to her premorbid level.\\nThe ANCA titer fell to 46 U per milliliter after the initiation of treatment.\\nDR. SCHAEFER: The pulmonary ground-glass opacities were initially considered to be indicative of pulmonary edema. In the setting of Wegener's granulomatosis, however, they probably reflected hemorrhage. The calcified mediastinal nodes and calcified splenic and hepatic granulomas are consistent with the possibility of an earlier case of tuberculosis.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "{'query': \"A 75-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of weakness and a tendency to fall.\\nEight months earlier, a temporal-artery biopsy, with negative results, had been performed elsewhere because of frequent headaches and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain at that time showed enhancement by gadolinium of the cerebellar tentorium, which was more prominent on the right side, in the posterior middle cranial fossa and posterior fossa, without mass effect or evidence of obstruction. Soon thereafter, esophagogastroduodenoscopic and colonoscopic examinations revealed active gastritis, for which the patient received omeprazole. Two months later, her memory deteriorated, and she began to dress carelessly. Three months before admission, she experienced vague dizziness and had a tendency to fall; she began to walk with a cane. Two weeks before admission, she fell in the bathtub and remained there all night because of generalized weakness. One day before admission, she again fell, striking her occiput and lying on the floor for two hours because of diffuse weakness. She was brought to this hospital.\\nThe patient had had endometrial cancer 16 years before admission, which was treated with a hysterectomy and radiotherapy. Six years later, a partial colectomy with a colostomy was performed because of colonic carcinoma.\\nThe temperature was 36.4°C, the pulse was 61, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 165/85 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was somnolent. A grade 3 systolic murmur was heard along the sternal border, and it radiated to the axilla. A functioning right-sided colostomy was present. On neurologic examination, she was oriented to the city and knew she was in a hospital, which she could not identify. Her attention span was short. Her ability to name objects was preserved, but she could not recall three objects after five minutes. There was fine nystagmus on right lateral gaze. Hearing was impaired bilaterally. A slight left-sided facial droop was noted. There was no other evidence of cranial-nerve dysfunction. Muscle strength was slightly reduced in the left arm and leg. Fine finger movements became smaller when sustained. The patient held on to furniture while walking and had a tendency to lean to the left. Retropulsion was present. She was unstable on standing. She refused testing of the deep-tendon reflexes. Bilateral grasp reflexes were observed; the plantar responses were flexor.\\nThe urine was normal. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 60, with delayed R-wave progression in leads V₁ through V₅. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain (Fig. 1) revealed thickening and increased density of the tentorium and of the dura overlying the left cerebellar hemisphere, with dense enhancement. The right lateral and third ventricles were dilated, and transependymal edema surrounded the right lateral ventricle; no obstructive lesion was identified. Omeprazole was administered, and phenytoin sodium was subsequently added.\\nOn the second hospital day, a gadolinium-enhanced MRI study of the brain (Fig. 2 and 3) revealed thickening of the tentorium and left cerebellar dura that was isointense on T₁-weighted images, hypointense on T₂-weighted images, and partly enhanced. The right lateral and third ventricles were dilated, with edema surrounding the right lateral ventricle. T₂-weighted images showed hyperintense foci in the pons, right thalamus, and periventricular white matter. No flow void was detected in the infraclinoid portion of the left internal carotid artery. A lumbar puncture was performed (Table 3). A CT scan of the thorax (Fig. 4) showed patchy ground-glass opacities throughout both lungs and subpleural nodular opacities, 2 to 3 mm in diameter, in the superior segment of the left lower lobe and in the posterior right middle lobe, with calcified precarinal and subcarinal lymph nodes, 5 to 10 mm in diameter. A CT scan of the abdomen, obtained after the administration of contrast material, showed punctate calcifications throughout the liver and spleen, gallstones, and bilateral renal cysts.\\nOn the sixth hospital day, laboratory tests were performed (Table 2). On the 10th day, the patient became more disoriented and lethargic, required assistance to stand, and had an ataxic gait. The results of a tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative, 5 TU) were strongly positive.\\nOn the 13th hospital day, the patient was stuporous. She awakened only briefly in response to noxious stimulation and moved the right arm and leg more vigorously than the left. All deep-tendon reflexes were diminished. The results of a urinalysis were normal. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 4). Radiographs of the chest were unremarkable.\\nOn the next day, a ventriculostomy was performed, and vancomycin was administered intravenously. The cerebrospinal fluid was examined (Table 3). Microscopical examination of biopsy specimens of the meninges (Fig. 5) showed granulomatous pachymeningitis, with numerous ill-defined collections of epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without necrosis. Special stains showed no mycobacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms. The leptomeninges contained scattered inflammatory cells; cerebellar tissue in the specimen was normal. During the next few days, the patient became more alert and communicative. On the 17th day, laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). All culture specimens were negative.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. WILLIAM J. SCHWARTZ*: This woman’s illness was heralded by headaches, then progressed indolently over a period of eight months to affect both her mind and her gait. By the time of admission, an encephalopathy had developed that was characterized by clouded consciousness, postural instability, diminished hearing with asymmetric nystagmus, and a left hemiparesis.\\nThe first question is whether this complicated clinical picture can be attributed to a single pathologic entity. I believe that it can, and my working hypothesis will be that the patient’s clinical presentation represents the neurologic manifestation of a process that generally affects the lungs.\\nMay we review the imaging studies?\\nDR. PAMELA W. SCHAEFER: On a CT scan of the head obtained after the administration of contrast material (Fig. 1), the tentorium appears thickened, with dense enhancement. An MRI scan (Fig. 2 and 3) shows that the tentorium and the dura overlying the left cerebellar hemisphere and part of the right cerebellar hemisphere are isointense in relation to the brain on T₁-weighted images and hypointense on T₂-weighted images, with dense enhancement after the administration of gadolinium. There is no leptomeningeal enhancement. The right lateral and third ventricles are dilated, with edema surrounding the right lateral ventricle. There is no evidence of sinusitis. A CT scan of the chest (Fig. 4) shows bilateral, diffuse, patchy ground-glass opacities; calcified mediastinal nodes, 1 cm in diameter; and scattered, tiny subpleural nodules.\\nDR. SCHWARTZ: Hydrocephalus and meningitis can account for the neurologic findings in this case. In view of the evidence of transependymal edema and sulcal effacement, the marked dilatation of the right lateral ventricle must reflect an increase in intraventricular pressure rather than a loss of hemispheric tissue. Features of the patient’s encephalopathy are consistent with increased intracranial pressure, and the left hemiparesis is probably due to compromise of the contralateral corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts in the periventricular white matter of the right hemisphere. Meningitis might be a factor in the patient’s hearing loss, but support for this interpretation requires more information about whether the deficit is conductive, sensorineural, or both.\\nAlthough it seems certain that the meningitis caused the hydrocephalus, the causal mechanism is unclear. An initial consideration is a blockage of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid by leptomeningeal inflammation at the level of the thickened tentorium, at the base of the brain, or at both sites, but the normal sizes of the fourth ventricle and aqueduct argue against this explanation. Moreover, an extraventricular obstruction would not account for the asymmetry of the lateral ventricles. If the asymmetry had been partly congenital or due to a previous injury, it should have been seen on the MRI scan obtained eight months before admission. Experimental and clinical evidence has implicated impaired cerebral venous drainage in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. Since the periosteal and meningeal layers of the dura split to form venous sinuses, perhaps inflammation of the tentorium caused narrowing or thrombosis of the straight sinus, but the MRI scan does not show either abnormality. Also, there is now a general consensus that venous insufficiency is not an important mechanism in the development of hydrocephalus.¹\\nAnother explanation of the hydrocephalus is based on the concept that ventricular enlargement is partly determined by the difference in pressure between the ventricle and the overlying subarachnoid compartment.¹ If meningeal exudate were to obliterate the subarachnoid space over the right hemisphere, the resulting elevation of the transmural pressure gradient across the right cerebral mantle might contribute to right ventricular dilatation, but again, the MRI scan does not show this change, and the cortical subarachnoid spaces appear normal. I am left with the view that there must be an invisible intraventricular obstruction above the aqueduct and around the right foramen of Monro. The finding of normal ventricular fluid on ventriculostomy is not surprising, since the dilated ventricle from which the fluid was obtained is proximal to (i.e., upstream of) the hypothesized block. Intraoperative instillation of a nonionic contrast agent into the right lateral ventricle might have helped delineate the anatomical features of the hydrocephalus.\\nThe finding of granulomatous pachymeningitis with relative sparing of the leptomeninges in this case allows me to focus on a smaller differential diagnosis of chronic meningitis. That finding, along with the normal appearance and flow-cytometric features of the lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid, dissuade me from strongly considering neoplastic meningeal seeding, which may appear as a pachymeningitis on MRI.² This case highlights the excellent diagnostic results obtained when meningeal biopsies are performed in regions showing enhancement with gadolinium on MRI scans.³\\nTuberculous meningitis is a primary consideration in any patient with granulomatous meningitis, pulmonary disease, and a positive tuberculin test.⁴,⁵ The disorder follows bacillemia, which originates either in a primary tubercular lesion or in one that is reactivated in association with aging, immunosuppression, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. The characteristic features of active tuberculosis may not accompany the meningitis, and chest radiographs are normal in over half of affected adults. The typical pattern of mononuclear pleocytosis with elevated protein and reduced glucose levels is found in only a minority of patients; as in this case, the protein level is less than 100 mg per deciliter, and the glucose level is more than 45 mg per deciliter (2.5 mmol per liter) in a quarter to a third of infected adults. Hyponatremia due to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone is found in some but not all patients. Smears and cultures of cerebrospinal fluid have a low sensitivity for identifying the tubercle bacillus, but the sensitivity can be increased to more than 80 percent by meticulous attention to technique, including the collection of multiple specimens of 10 to 15 ml and examination of up to 500 highpower fields.⁷ Since this type of examination requires about 30 minutes, the laboratory must be informed that the diagnosis is being considered. In this case, cultures were still negative on the 17th hospital day, but this is not surprising, since Mycobacterium tuberculosis takes about 20 times as long to generate as most other bacteria, and detectable growth in culture may take up to 8 weeks. Promising new tests based on immunologic techniques and the polymerase chain reaction offer hope for more rapid confirmation.\\nSeveral features of this patient’s illness, however, raise serious doubts about the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The duration of symptoms for eight months is not characteristic of tuberculous meningitis. The median duration of symptoms before presentation ranges from two to four weeks and rarely exceeds a few months; untreated patients usually die within eight weeks. The absence of fever is also atypical. Fever occurs at some time during the course of the illness in more than 80 percent of patients, and in some series, fever is more frequent than an alteration of consciousness.⁶,⁸ Although hydrocephalus is the most common neuroradiologic abnormality, it is usually the communicating type, and other findings, such as tuberculomas and infarcts in the distribution of the medial striae and thalamoperforate arteries, are often present. Leptomeningeal enhancement of the basal cisterns is the usual pattern, and a hypertrophic pachymeningitis is rare.¹⁰-¹² The erythrocyte sedimentation rate varies but is often only slightly elevated; this patient’s level is unexpectedly high, especially in view of the normal chest film. Finally, there was no evidence of upper-lobe cavitation or endobronchial disease on the CT scan of the chest. The combination of these atypical findings leads me to consider alternative diagnoses.\\nOther infections can cause granulomatous meningitis.¹³ Although nontuberculous mycobacteria usually infect patients with chronic lung disorders or depressed cellular immunity, disease caused by M. avium complex can occur in apparently normal persons and can occasionally cause meningitis. Such patients, however, characteristically present with a productive cough and abnormal chest films. The deep mycoses may cause a meningoencephalitis associated with a mild, resolving, or asymptomatic pulmonary infection. The most common type of fungal meningitis is cryptococcal, even in immunocompetent patients, but the test for serum cryptococcal antigen, which has a sensitivity of at least 90 percent, was negative in this case. Coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis rarely disseminate to the nervous system. Blastomycosis generally infects the brain and meninges late in the course of advanced disease. Aspergillus, mucor, and Pseudallescheria boydii are not usually found in immunocompetent persons. Among bacteria, brucella can cause a chronic granulomatous meningitis, but it is typically associated with fever, constitutional symptoms, and a history of exposure to infected animal tissues or products. Finally, the spirochetes Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi may cause lesions that are predominantly or even entirely meningeal, but infection with either of these organisms would not explain the findings on the CT scan of the chest. Also, the negative serologic tests of cerebrospinal fluid and serum provide no diagnostic support, although their sensitivities are not optimal.\\nNeurologic involvement occurs in 5 percent of patients with sarcoidosis and is the presenting manifestation in about half these patients.¹⁴-¹⁶ Findings include cranial neuropathies and occasionally pachymeningitis. Nevertheless, it would be unusual for hydrocephalus and aseptic meningitis to be the sole manifestations of neurosarcoidosis. Also, only 10 to 15 percent of patients present with pulmonary infiltrates in the absence of lymphadenopathy. Finally, this patient’s relatively advanced age, extremely high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and normal angiotensin-converting-enzyme level in association with an active pulmonary process make the diagnosis of sarcoidosis unlikely.\\nWegener’s granulomatosis is a serious consideration in this case.¹⁷ A median interval of 15 months from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis has been reported. Although over 90 percent of patients have some type of airway disease, the initial manifestation of the disorder may not occur in the nose, sinuses, or lungs. Abnormalities on radiographs of the chest include infiltrates, nodules, and hemorrhages, reflecting the complex underlying pathological lesions characterized by necrosis, granulomas composed of palisading histiocytes, and vasculitis.¹⁸ In about a third of cases, the pulmonary lesions detected radiographically are asymptomatic. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is almost always markedly elevated, and hypergammaglobulinemia may be present. The discovery that antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are present in patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis has led to early diagnosis of the disease and improved monitoring of its progression and treatment. An immunofluorescent pattern of diffuse cytoplasmic staining (c-ANCA) has a sensitivity of at least 90 percent and a specificity approaching 99 percent for diagnosing generalized Wegener’s granulomatosis. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has demonstrated the presence of an antibody that in most cases is directed against a 29-kd serine proteinase (proteinase 3). This immunologic reaction may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease by inducing neutrophil degranulation.¹⁹\\nNeurologic complications of Wegener’s granulomatosis occur in 20 to 50 percent of cases, although they are not usually the initial signs of the illness.²⁰,²¹ Mechanisms of nervous system involvement include invasion from contiguous structures, independent formation of intracranial granulomas, and vasculitis. The most frequent clinical disorder is peripheral neuropathy, generally in the form of mononeuropathy multiplex. Common symptoms include headache, which is usually due to sinusitis or orbital disease, and hearing loss due to otitis media or to vasculitic or granulomatous involvement of the auditory nerve. Individual cranial neuropathies and cerebrovascular events also occur. Less than 10 percent of patients with neurologic manifestations have meningitis. In two case reports,²²,²³ the authors noted thickening with enhancement of the tentorium and dura similar to that seen in this case. Dural biopsies in these cases showed granulomatous pachymeningitis consistent with the diagnosis of Wegener’s granulomatosis, which was subsequently confirmed by positive ANCA tests. Other authors have emphasized meningeal involvement²⁴-²⁷ and the diagnostic value of ANCA tests of cerebrospinal fluid.²⁸ In the present case, which is characterized by a granulomatous pachymeningitis, a very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and asymptomatic pulmonary opacities and nodules, none of the findings are inconsistent with the diagnosis of Wegener’s granulomatosis.\\nIn addition to Wegener’s granulomatosis, however, several other immune-related granulomatous disorders that involve the central nervous system should be considered.²⁹,³⁰ Isolated granulomatous angiitis is manifested as an acute or subacute multifocal encephalopathy and affects small parenchymal and leptomeningeal vessels; extracranial vasculitis is unusual, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is often normal. Forms of systemic necrotizing vasculitis that involve the nervous system include polyarteritis nodosa and the Churg-Strauss syndrome. Neurologic manifestations of polyarteritis nodosa occur late in the course of systemic disease, and asthma and hypereosinophilia are defining features of the Churg-Strauss syndrome. Peripheral neuropathy is the most common neurologic complication in both disorders. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare disease of the lungs and skin characterized by angiocentric and angiodestructive infiltrates of atypical lymphocytes and plasma cells, which sometimes progress to full-blown lymphoma.³¹,³² Cranial neuropathies and necrotic mass lesions in the cortex or brain stem occur in about 25 percent of cases of lymphomatoid granulomatosis and may be initial features.³³ However, severe respiratory insufficiency and abnormalities on chest radiographs are characteristic of this disorder, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually normal or only slightly elevated, and neither giant cells nor discrete palisading granulomas are seen. Rheumatoid disease may cause a meningoencephalopathy, with vasculitis and rheumatoid nodules typically found in the dura,³⁴ but this complication usually occurs in patients with a positive test for rheumatoid factor and clinically established rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, none of these disorders fit the clinical picture in this case.\\nIdiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis¹²,³⁵-³⁷ is a rare disorder characterized on neuroimaging by evidence of thickening and enhancement of the dura, especially of the tentorium and falx. It is typically a chronic disease and is manifested most often by headache, ataxia, and cranial-nerve palsies. Dural granulomas are seen in 10 percent of cases. I could find only one case in which the patient was tested for ANCA, and the results were negative.³⁵ It would be premature to make the diagnosis of idiopathic hypertrophic cranial pachymeningitis in this case, and it would not explain the pulmonary findings.\\nTuberculous meningitis is the diagnosis I would have been anxious not to overlook, and in view of the patient’s age and her altered mental status on admission, I would have initiated antituberculous therapy immediately while looking for conclusive evidence of this or an alternative diagnosis. Empirical antituberculous therapy does not compromise the yield of positive cerebrospinal fluid smears or cultures if specimens are collected within the first week of treatment.\\nNevertheless, for the reasons I have outlined, I believe Wegener’s granulomatosis is the correct diagnosis, and the next diagnostic procedure should have been an ANCA test on the serum, with the hope of avoiding a lung biopsy. It is important to confirm this diagnosis, since prompt treatment with prednisone and cyclophosphamide results in marked improvement or partial remission in over 90 percent of cases.¹⁸\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nTuberculosis or Wegener's granulomatosis.\\nDR. WILLIAM J. SCHWARTZ'S DIAGNOSIS\\nWegener's granulomatosis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. JOHN L. NILES: The diagnostic procedure was serologic testing for ANCA. Indirect immunofluorescence testing revealed a perinuclear pattern of staining (p-ANCA). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to the neutrophil cytoplasmic protein myeloperoxidase was positive at a titer of 128 U per milliliter (normal value, less than 2.8). A test for antibodies to the neutrophil cytoplasmic protein proteinase 3 was negative. Antibodies to proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase are highly specific markers for the spectrum of diseases with vasculitis that includes Wegener’s granulomatosis, microscopical polyangiitis, the Churg-Strauss syndrome, and primary necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis.³⁸-⁴⁰ The biopsy findings, together with the presence of antimyeloperoxidase antibodies, are diagnostic of Wegener’s granulomatosis.\\nSeveral assays for the detection of ANCA have been described. Indirect immunofluorescence testing is performed by staining neutrophils for the presence of one of two patterns: c-ANCA or p-ANCA. Antigen-specific immunoassays for the detection of antibodies to proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase are performed with the use of immunofluorescence. The c-ANCA pattern of staining is closely correlated with the presence of antibodies to proteinase 3. Antibodies to myeloperoxidase are among several autoantibodies that produce the p-ANCA pattern. Only the findings of c-ANCA due to antibodies to proteinase 3 and p-ANCA due to antibodies to myeloperoxidase are specific for a spectrum of vasculitic syndromes that I have mentioned.⁴¹-⁴³\\nThese syndromes have long been known to be related. When there is renal involvement, it is generally in the form of a pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis. Wegener’s granulomatosis has been described as a variant of polyarteritis nodosa; the Churg-Strauss syndrome has been considered a variant of Wegener’s granulomatosis, and pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis limited to the kidneys has even been called “renal-limited Wegener’s granulomatosis.” The clinical and histologic features of these syndromes overlap, and the features in an individual patient may evolve from those characteristic of one syndrome into those characteristic of another. Although earlier studies suggested that Wegener’s granulomatosis is specifically correlated with the presence of antibodies to proteinase 3,⁴⁴,⁴⁵ more recent reports have indicated that some patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis have antimyeloperoxidase antibodies.⁴²,⁴⁶\\nThe sensitivity of ANCA tests for diagnosing this spectrum of diseases is more than 90 percent when systemic disease is present,⁴¹ but when the disease is localized and no renal involvement is evident, the sensitivity is lower.⁴²,⁴⁵ The specificity of ANCA testing depends on how the assays are performed. Antigen-specific immunoassays performed together with immunofluorescence testing appear to provide the best results. With the techniques used at this hospital, the specificity of the assays has been more than 99 percent⁴¹,⁴³ and even higher when the titer of antibodies to proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase is high, as in this case.\\nThe positive predictive value of ANCA assays also depends on the prevalence or prior probability of disease in the group of patients being tested. The pretest probability of Wegener’s granulomatosis in this case was at least moderate, if not high. Even a pretest probability of only 10 percent, if combined with the high ANCA titer, would yield a predictive value of more than 97 percent. Together with the granulomatous features of the dural-biopsy specimen and the absence of the discrete tubercle-like granulomas that are characteristic of tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, the findings were considered diagnostic of Wegener's granulomatosis.\\nDR. MICHAEL A. PANZARA: The patient was initially treated presumptively for tuberculosis with isoniazid and three other drugs while we continued the diagnostic workup. Once the ANCA titer was reported to be positive, the patient received intravenous methylprednisolone as well as cyclophosphamide. Treatment with isoniazid was continued because of the positive tuberculin test. She was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation hospital while receiving prednisone and cyclophosphamide, and her condition has subsequently continued to improve. She is now ambulatory and living independently at a level of functioning very close to her premorbid level.\\nThe ANCA titer fell to 46 U per milliliter after the initiation of treatment.\\nDR. SCHAEFER: The pulmonary ground-glass opacities were initially considered to be indicative of pulmonary edema. In the setting of Wegener's granulomatosis, however, they probably reflected hemorrhage. The calcified mediastinal nodes and calcified splenic and hepatic granulomas are consistent with the possibility of an earlier case of tuberculosis.\", 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"Based on the patient's presentation, imaging findings, laboratory results, and the context provided, the most likely diagnosis is **Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis - GPA)**.\\n\\nHere's the reasoning:\\n\\n1.  **Information Gathering:** The patient presents with a chronic, progressive course of symptoms including headache, neurological deficits (ataxia, nystagmus, hemiparesis), and pulmonary findings (ground-glass opacities, calcified mediastinal nodes).

The absence of significant renal involvement (at least initially) is also less common in Wegener's.\\n    *   **Point-of-Care Tests/Labs:**\\n        *   ANCA testing (ELISA and immunofluorescence) is crucial for diagnosis.\\n        *   Chest X-ray or CT scan to assess for pulmonary involvement.\\n        *   Lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis.\\n        *   Brain MRI to evaluate for intracranial lesions.\\n        *   Urinalysis to assess for renal involvement.\\n        *   Complete blood count (CBC) to look for anemia or leukocytosis.\\n        *   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.\\n        *   Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) to rule out multiple myeloma.\\n        *   Consider a temporal artery biopsy if giant cell arteritis is suspected.\\n    *   **Diagnostic Biases:** Anchoring bias (over-reliance on initial findings) and availability bias (over-reliance on readily available tests) should be avoided.\\n\\n4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:**\\n\\n    *   The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of Wegener's granulomatosis. The positive ANCA test, granulomatous inflammation on biopsy, and the combination of neurological and pulmonary symptoms strongly support this diagnosis. While TB is a consideration given the positive TST, the absence of typical pulmonary findings and the presence of ANCA make Wegener's more likely.\\n    *   The initial treatment with empiric antibiotics for TB is reasonable, but the positive ANCA test should prompt a change in management to include immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide) to prevent further organ damage.\\n    *   The patient's age and comorbidities (prior cancer, colectomy) should be considered when choosing immunosuppressive agents.\\n\\nWORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Wegener's granulomatosis (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis - GPA), active, with neurological and pulmonary involvement.\\nDISEASE_NAME: Wegener's granulomatosis\\n\", 'original_file': 'NEJM199903253401208.json'}\n",

One month before admis-\\nsion, the patient entered another hospital because\\nfor several weeks she had had bladder and bowel in-\\ncontinence, leg weakness, and severe pain in the\\nthighs on attempting to stand.\\nA computed tomographic (CT) scan of the lum-\\nbar spine (Fig. 1) showed abnormal epidural and\\nparaspinal soft-tissue masses at the L4 level and\\nwithin the sacral spinal canal and the possible pres-\\nence of such tissue within the sacral alae. The find-\\nings on a chest radiograph and a radionuclide bone\\nscan were normal. A CT scan of the abdomen and\\npelvis revealed a left renal mass, 1.5 cm in diameter,\\nand a right renal mass, 1 cm in diameter, that could\\nnot be further characterized. There were bilateral re-\\nnal cysts and a right adnexal cyst.\\nTreatment with dexamethasone was begun. Nee-\\ndle biopsy of the lower spine on two occasions\\nshowed no evidence of tumor. Because of the strong\\npossibility of metastatic tumor growth, a course of\\n10 fractions of palliative radiation was administered\\nto the lumbosacral spine but had no effect on the\\npain or incontinence. The patient had intermittent\\nfever, the cause of which was not discovered, al-\\nthough a repeated radiograph of the chest showed a\\nquestionable left-sided pulmonary infiltrate.\\nAntibiotics were given intravenously, with tran-\\nsient improvement. Findings on microscopical ex-\\namination of a bone-marrow specimen were normal.\\nThe patient was sent home, where she became weak-\\ner. Two days before admission to this hospital, her\\ntemperature rose to 39.4°C, with chills and confu-\\nsion. She was readmitted to the other hospital,\\nwhere a CT scan of the chest showed a necrotic cav-\\nitating mass in the periphery of the right lung; the\\nbilateral renal lesions of low attenuation appeared to\\nhave increased in size. Fluids and ceftazidime were\\nadministered, and the fever promptly resolved. The\\npatient was transferred to this hospital.\\nThe patient had a 35-pack-year history of cigarette\\nsmoking but had stopped smoking five years before\\nadmission. The aortic valve had been replaced two\\nyears before admission, and a demand pacemaker\\nhad been implanted because of a surgical complica-\\ntion during the replacement procedure. She had an-\\norexia and had lost 9 kg in weight during the three\\nmonths before admission. She took warfarin and\\nquinidine regularly and took prophylactic amoxicil-\\nlin for dental procedures. There was no history of\\ntrauma, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, sputum produc-\\ntion, or hemoptysis.\\nThe temperature was 36.5°C, the pulse was 102,\\nand the respirations were 20. The blood pressure\\nwas 110/70 mm Hg. On physical examination, the\\npatient was thin and appeared to have a chronic ill-\\nness. Crackles were audible over the lower half of the\\nleft lung and the lower quarter of the right lung. A\\ngrade 3 systolic ejection murmur was present. The\\nbreasts were normal. The findings on abdominal\\nexamination were normal. No digital clubbing was\\npresent.\\nOn neurologic examination, the first dorsal inter-\\nosseus muscles were atrophic and the legs were wast-\\ned; tone was decreased in the right leg and was\\nslightly increased in the left. Muscle strength was\\n3-/5 in the right quadriceps, 2+/5 in the right\\ngastrocnemius, and 2/5 in the right anterior tibial\\nmuscle, and was 2/5 in the left quadriceps, 2/5 in\\nthe left gastrocnemius, and 2/5 in the left anterior\\ntibial muscle. Sensation was normal. The deep-ten-\\ndon reflexes were ++ in the arms and knees, there\\nwas a left Babinski sign, and the right plantar re-\\nsponse was equivocal.\\nThe urinary sediment contained 3 to 5 red cells,\\n0 to 2 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power\\nfield. The results of laboratory tests performed at\\nthis time and subsequently are shown in Tables 1, 2,\\nand 3. A thoracolumbar CT myelographic study\\n(Fig. 2) showed no evidence of soft-tissue masses. A\\nlumbar puncture was performed (Table 4).\\nWarfarin was discontinued. Dexamethasone was\\ncontinued, and heparin, sertraline, and nystatin were\\ngiven. The temperature was usually normal but oc-\\ncasionally exceeded 37.5°C. On the third hospital\\nday, CT scans of the head and neck showed normal\\nfindings. Sodium chloride solution and pamidronate\\nwere given intravenously; thereafter, the calcium lev-\\nel ranged from 6.7 to 8.3 mg per deciliter (1.7 to\\n2.1 mmol per liter). A CT scan of the thorax (Fig.\\n3) showed multiple nodules, 1 to 4 cm in diameter,\\nthroughout the lungs and a pleural mass, 4 cm in di-\\nameter, in the right upper lobe. Urodynamic evalu-\\nation showed a neurogenic bladder with motor func-\\ntion and with preserved sensation in the bladder.\\nOn the fifth hospital day, microscopical examina-\\ntion of a specimen from a CT-guided needle biopsy\\nof the large lung mass showed numerous Nocardia\\nasteroides organisms but no malignant cells. Speci-\\nmens of blood were obtained for culture, and tri-\\nmethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was administered. The\\nnext day, a urine culture yielded gram-positive rods\\nidentified as nocardia species. Two days later, levels\\nof parathyroid hormone and parathyroid-related\\nprotein were normal. A CT scan of the abdomen\\nand pelvis showed multiple hypodense lesions, less\\nthan 3 mm in diameter; multiple minimally en-\\nhanced solid areas in the upper poles of both kid-\\nneys were unchanged. On the eighth hospital day,\\nanother lumbar puncture was performed (Table 4).\\nOn the 10th hospital day, transesophageal cardi-\\nac ultrasonography showed no valvular vegetations.\\nNerve-conduction studies of the legs and the left\\narm showed compound muscle action potentials of\\nlow amplitude in both extensor digitorum brevi,\\nwithout F responses. Needle electromyographic ex-\\namination revealed widespread active denervation in\\nthe legs and the lumbar paraspinal muscles. There\\nwas chronic bilateral denervation in the arms, with\\nactive denervation in one muscle. The findings sug-\\ngested the presence of a disorder of the motor neu-\\nrons or their roots.\\nOn the 16th hospital day, a lumbar puncture was\\nperformed (Table 4). Hematochezia occurred, and\\nthe hematocrit fell to 22.4 percent, with a white-cell\\ncount of 9800 per cubic millimeter and a platelet\\ncount of 127,000 per cubic millimeter; the hapto-\\nglobin level was normal. Two units of packed red\\ncells were transfused.\\nThe next day, a CT scan of the abdomen and pel-\\nvis, obtained before and after the intravenous ad-\\nministration of contrast material, showed cortical\\nlytic lesions with a moth-eaten appearance in the left\\niliac wing, the left femur, and both inferior pubic\\nrami. A soft-tissue mass, 4 cm in diameter, was an-\\nterior to the neck of the left femur. Radiographs of\\nthe pelvis and hips (Fig. 4) showed osteolytic lesions\\nof the head, neck, and proximal diaphysis of the left\\nfemur, with an associated soft-tissue mass.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. ARNOLD S. FREEDMAN*: May we review the\\nradiologic studies?\\nDR. GLENN D. BAREST: The CT scan of the lum-\\nbar spine obtained one month before admission\\n(Fig. 1) shows a soft-tissue mass in the left anterior\\nepidural space at the L4 level. This mass deforms the\\nthecal sac and extends through the neural foramen,\\nobliterating the normal paraspinal fat plane. The CT\\nmyelogram obtained on admission (Fig. 2) shows\\nresolution of the abnormal soft-tissue mass.\\nThe CT scan of the chest obtained two days after\\nadmission (Fig. 3) reveals a cavitary mass, 4 cm in\\ndiameter, in the right upper lobe and multiple small\\nnodules in both lungs, without mediastinal lym-\\nphadenopathy. A CT scan of the abdomen obtained\\nthe next day without intravenously administered\\ncontrast material shows bilateral, nonenhancing sol-\\nid renal masses and multiple, very small hepatic le-\\nsions. A subsequent CT scan of the abdomen and\\npelvis shows, in addition, cortical lytic lesions in the\\nleft pelvic bones and femur. Radiographic examina-\\ntion of the left hip (Fig. 4) shows osteolytic lesions\\nof the femur and a large associated soft-tissue mass\\nwithout a periosteal reaction.\\nDR. FREEDMAN: The differential diagnosis in this\\ncase comprises diseases that lead to disseminated no-\\ncardiosis. Nocardia organisms can infect immuno-\\ncompetent persons, but most affected patients have\\nunderlying diseases involving abnormalities of cellu-\\nlar immunity or, less often, disorders of the leuko-\\ncytes and humoral immunity (Table 5).1,2\\nWas disseminated nocardiosis responsible for the\\nepidural mass, lytic bone lesions, neurologic symp-\\ntoms, and renal lesions in this patient? She presented\\nwith fever and pulmonary lesions after dexametha-\\nsone and radiation therapy had been given to treat\\nan epidural mass. The pulmonary cavitary mass was\\nnoted at least two to three weeks after the patient\\nbegan to take corticosteroids. Moreover, the initial\\nCT scans of the lumbar spine and abdomen showed\\nepidural and renal lesions. In more than 70 percent\\nof cases, nocardial infection originates in the lungs,\\nand it may affect contiguous soft tissues and bone. 1,2\\nThe next site of most frequent involvement, as the\\ninfection progresses, is the central nervous system,\\nfollowed by the skin and soft tissues, with hematog-\\nenous dissemination. Osteomyelitis due to nocardia\\nis uncommon; only 12 cases had been reported be-\\nfore 1987.3 The vertebral bodies were involved in\\nthree of these cases, and the osteomyelitis was man-\\nifested most often as collapse and less often as an\\nepidural mass causing compression of the spinal cord.\\nThe patient under discussion had no radiographic\\nabnormalities of the spine.\\nNocardial infection involves the central nervous\\nsystem in 20 to 40 percent of patients, most often\\nin the form of brain abscesses; isolated meningitis in\\nthe absence of brain abscess is uncommon.4 The\\npredominant finding in this patient was motor-neu-\\nron dysfunction, without meningeal signs and with\\nnormal findings on a CT scan of the head. Eighty-\\nthree percent of patients with nocardia meningitis\\nhave neutrophilic pleocytosis, 64 percent have hy-\\npoglycorrhachia, and 61 percent have a cerebrospi-\\nnal fluid protein level greater than 100 mg per dec-\\niliter. In this case, a urine culture yielded nocardia\\norganisms, but the renal masses were probably not\\nabscesses caused by nocardial infection, since they\\nappeared before the pulmonary lesions and since re-\\nnal masses are not commonly caused by nocardia.2\\nAlthough the lesions in the liver were small, hepatic\\ninvolvement in nocardial infection has been reported\\nin 3 percent of cases and may have been part of the\\ndisseminated infection in this patient.2 Since this pa-\\ntient had undergone aortic-valve replacement, pros-\\nthetic-valve endocarditis due to nocardia was con-\\nsidered part of a disseminated nocardial infection.\\nProsthetic-valve involvement in nocardial infection\\nhas been reported only rarely,5 but when it occurs,\\nit usually does so soon after valve replacement, and\\nthe patients have positive blood cultures for the or-\\nganism and normal echocardiographic findings.\\nThe differential diagnosis of this patient\\'s purely\\nlytic bone disease includes infectious diseases, neo-\\nplasms, and disorders that fit in neither category. Os-\\nteomyelitis usually does not cause purely lytic lesions\\nwithout a periosteal reaction and positive findings on\\na bone scan. The microbiologic data do not suggest\\na second infection. Skeletal tuberculosis is also unlike-\\nly in this case,6 since it most commonly affects the\\nspine, followed by the proximal femur. Although a\\nparavertebral abscess can form with spinal cord com-\\npression, the adjacent bone and disk typically show\\nsigns of a destructive process. This patient\\'s renal le-\\nsions were also not typical of those associated with tu-\\nberculosis, which include calcifications, destruction of\\ncollecting systems, and cavitary lesions. The patient\\ndid not have pyuria, and the cultures for tuberculosis\\nwere negative. Her neurologic symptoms did not in-\\nclude headache, meningismus, or changes in mental\\nstatus. Although the final sample of cerebrospinal flu-\\nid showed an elevated level of protein and a low level\\nof glucose, the absence of pleocytosis makes tubercu-\\nlous meningitis unlikely. Tuberculosis and nocardiosis\\ncan coexist, and in 1 to 6 percent of patients with tu-\\nberculosis, nocardia is cultured from sputum.7 How-\\never, no tubercle bacilli were detected in this patient.\\nA noninfectious, non-neoplastic disorder is an un-\\nlikely diagnosis. Chronic sarcoidosis can cause lytic,\\nsclerotic, and permeative bone lesions affecting main-\\nly the small bones of the hands and occasionally the\\npelvic bones and vertebrae. Affected patients almost\\nalways have lung and skin involvement.8 Hypercalce-\\nmia is due to increased production of calcitriol by\\nmacrophages. Neurologic symptoms occur in about\\n5 percent of cases; there may be involvement of the\\nleptomeninges, often accompanied by cranial-nerve\\npalsies. Langerhans\\'-cell histiocytoses can cause lytic\\nbone lesions, but this type of histiocytosis usually\\noccurs in children or adolescents, typically boys, and\\ntherefore would be an unlikely diagnosis in this case.\\nThe diagnosis of a widespread malignant tumor is\\nmost consistent with this patient\\'s presentation. The\\nclinical features that are important in the differential\\ndiagnosis are the epidural mass affecting lumbosacral\\nnerve roots, lytic bone lesions, renal masses, and the\\nabsence of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. A\\nlimited number of cancers cause purely lytic bone\\nlesions: renal-cell, lung, uterine, adrenocortical, and\\nthyroid carcinomas; multiple myeloma; and Hodg-\\nkin\\'s disease and non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma.10-12 None\\nof the findings suggested that this patient had a uter-\\nine, adrenocortical, or thyroid carcinoma, and except\\nfor hematuria, no findings suggested the diagnosis of\\nrenal-cell carcinoma. The renal masses were bilateral,\\nand synchronous bilateral renal-cell carcinoma occurs\\nin only 2 to 4 percent of cases. It is also unlikely that\\nthis patient had lung cancer, despite her long history\\nof smoking and the known association of lung cancer\\nwith nocardial infection. A needle biopsy of the lung\\nmass showed no malignant cells, and the diagnostic\\naccuracy of CT-guided needle biopsy of a 4-cm lung\\nmass exceeds 90 percent. 13 The epidural mass was not\\nassociated with an adjacent destructive lesion of the\\nvertebral bodies, so the mass was probably not a me-\\ntastasis of a solid tumor. Its regression after radiation\\ntherapy appeared to be complete, indicating that the\\ntumor was very sensitive to radiation.\\nThe moth-eaten appearance of the pelvis and fe-\\nmur in this case is characteristic of multiple myelo-\\nma.10 The patient had hypercalcemia, and the serum\\ncreatinine level rose after intravenous administration\\nof contrast material, as is often seen in patients with\\nmyeloma. However, the degree of bone marrow\\nplasmacytosis was less than 10 percent, there was no\\nclear evidence of a serum M component, and the\\nimmunoglobulin levels were not depressed. The low\\nlevel of IgG lambda M component may be a sign of\\nmonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined impor-\\ntance. Although the epidural mass might be an extra-\\ndural plasmacytoma, myeloma that causes compres-\\nsion of the epidural spinal cord is usually associated\\nwith destructive lesions in the spine.\\nThe diagnosis that best explains the epidural and\\nassociated paraspinal mass, bone lesions, and renal\\nmasses is lymphoma, which commonly leads to no-\\ncardiosis. In three large series of patients with pul-\\nmonary and systemic nocardiosis, 29 to 54 percent\\nof the patients had lymphoma,1,14,15 and virtually all\\nof them received either chemotherapy or radiation\\ntherapy as well as corticosteroids.\\nEpidural Hodgkin\\'s disease is an unusual cause of\\nspinal cord compression. Most affected patients have\\nantecedent Hodgkin\\'s disease,16 which is believed to\\nreach the epidural space through the vertebral fora-\\nmen from paravertebral or bony masses. Hodgkin\\'s\\ndisease involves bone in 10 to 15 percent of cases\\nbut is seen at presentation in only 1 percent. 10,17 Sites\\nof bony involvement are the vertebrae, pelvis, or\\nproximal femur in 75 percent of cases, and 75 per-\\ncent of bony lesions are lytic, usually with a perme-\\native or moth-eaten appearance.10 In one large series,\\nhowever, only 14 percent of the lesions were entirely\\nlytic.11 Sixty percent of patients with Hodgkin\\'s dis-\\nease that involves the bone have constitutional symp-\\ntoms. Hodgkin\\'s disease can involve the kidneys, as\\nreported in 7 to 17 percent of cases at autopsy, and\\nusually both kidneys are diffusely enlarged. The ab-\\nsence of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in this\\ncase is uncharacteristic of Hodgkin\\'s disease.\\nSpinal cord compression occurs in 0.1 to 10 per-\\ncent of patients with non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma. 18-22\\nAs in this case, there may be no radiographic evi-\\ndence of paravertebral or vertebral involvement. 23\\nFurthermore, many patients who present with epi-\\ndural lymphoma have disseminated disease. Back pain\\nis usually present for several months before more\\nacute neurologic symptoms develop. The thoracic\\nlevel of the spine is involved most frequently, fol-\\nlowed by the lumbar and cervical levels. Diffuse\\nlarge-B-cell lymphoma is seen in 60 to 70 percent of\\npatients; follicular lymphoma is less common.\\nBone lesions are present in 4 percent of patients\\nat the time of the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin\\'s lym-\\nphoma, in 15 percent at some time during the\\ncourse of their disease, and in more than 60 percent\\nat autopsy.10 In some series, the proportion of pa-\\ntients with lytic bony lesions is greater than that in\\nHodgkin\\'s disease.\\nRenal involvement in non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma\\noccurs by either hematogenous spreading or, less of-\\nten (in 2 to 14 percent of patients), by direct exten-\\nsion.24 In some autopsy series, renal involvement has\\nbeen seen in as many as half the cases. The involve-\\nment is bilateral in at least 40 percent of patients\\nwith affected kidneys and forms multiple masses in\\nabout half of them. Solitary masses or diffuse en-\\nlargement occurs in about 20 percent of cases. Dif-\\nfuse large-B-cell lymphoma is the most common\\ntype of non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma that involves the\\nkidneys. Most patients have constitutional symptoms,\\nan elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level, nor-\\nmal renal function, and multiple extranodal sites of\\ndisease. In several series, renal involvement has been\\nassociated with widespread bone disease.\\nSeveral results of this patient\\'s laboratory studies\\ndeserve comment. The patient had a normochromic,\\nnormocytic anemia, which is present in about 30\\npercent of patients with non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma\\nat the time of the diagnosis. An elevated serum lac-\\ntate dehydrogenase level is reported in 50 percent of\\npatients with diffuse, aggressive non-Hodgkin\\'s lym-\\nphoma and in about 10 percent of patients with in-\\ndolent lymphoma. The elevation of the lactate dehy-\\ndrogenase level accompanies the transformation from\\na follicular to a diffuse aggressive form and indicates\\na poor prognosis. In this patient, the lactate dehy-\\ndrogenase level was high and rose rapidly, which is\\nunusual in Hodgkin\\'s disease. An elevated ferritin\\nlevel has also been reported in patients with ad-\\nvanced non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma.25 Patients with\\ndiffuse large-B-cell lymphoma have the highest ele-\\nvations of ferritin; those with small lymphocytic or\\nfollicular lymphoma have much lower levels. Eleva-\\ntions of serum B12 (bound to transcobalamin II)\\nhave been reported in patients with lymphoma26 as\\nwell as those with metastatic solid tumors, multiple\\nmyeloma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Hyper-\\ncalcemia occurs in 30 percent of patients with dif-\\nfuse, aggressive non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma but in\\nonly 1 to 2 percent of patients with indolent lym-\\nphoma.27 In about 40 percent of cases of non-\\nHodgkin\\'s lymphoma, the hypercalcemia is related\\nto elevated calcitriol levels. The normal levels of se-\\nrum parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hor-\\nmone-related protein in this patient are consistent\\nwith the presence of calcitriol-mediated hypercalce-\\nmia and provide stronger support for a diagnosis of\\ndiffuse aggressive non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma than\\nfor a diagnosis of indolent non-Hodgkin\\'s lympho-\\nma or Hodgkin\\'s disease.\\nHow can lymphoma account for the neurologic\\nfeatures of this case? The epidural lesion at L4 could\\nexplain the elevated level of cerebrospinal fluid pro-\\ntein and, with accompanying root compression, the\\nleg weakness and incontinence. Intramedullary lym-\\nphoma could produce upper and lower motor-neu-\\nron signs, but it would also affect sensation, re-\\nsulting in a spinal sensory level on examination. In\\nintramedullary lymphoma, the spinal cord is usually\\nenlarged, and the cerebrospinal fluid is cellular. In\\nthis case, the myelographic study did not reveal such\\na lesion. Leptomeningeal lymphoma would be ex-\\npected to have diffuse manifestations, including me-\\nningeal signs, cranial-nerve involvement, sensory loss,\\nand cerebral symptoms. An elevated protein level\\nand a low glucose level, as found in the cerebro-\\nspinal fluid examined on the 16th hospital day, are\\nconsistent with the presence of leptomeningeal lym-\\nphoma. Although the cytologic examination was in-\\nconclusive, the degenerated cell is a suspicious find-\\ning. Use of a polymerase-chain-reaction assay to detect\\na rearrangement of the immunoglobulin or T-cell-\\nreceptor gene would have a higher sensitivity for\\nidentifying a clonal population of neoplastic lymph-\\noid cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. 28\\nSubacute motor neuronopathy involving the low-\\ner motor neurons, which occurs with Hodgkin\\'s dis-\\nease and non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, could explain\\nthis patient\\'s weakness and muscle atrophy, but in\\nsubacute motor neuropathy, fasciculations are com-\\nmon, pain and upper-motor-neuron findings are un-\\nusual, and deep-tendon reflexes are absent.29 Wheth-\\ner amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is associated with\\nlymphoproliferative disorders is controversial, but it\\ncould explain the upper- and lower-motor-neuron\\nsigns and the elevated protein level in the cerebro-\\nspinal fluid. More than half of patients with amyo-\\ntrophic lateral sclerosis have paraproteinemia, with\\nhigh titers of antiglycolipid antibodies in some cases.\\nThe Guillain-Barré syndrome is associated with lym-\\nphoproliferative diseases, but if the patient under\\ndiscussion had this disorder, one would expect an\\nabsence of reflexes, more evidence of clinical progres-\\nsion, and an elevated protein level in the first sample\\nof cerebrospinal fluid examined. There were no sen-\\nsory signs or autonomic dysfunction.\\nPatients with intravascular lymphomatosis, which\\nis due to an aggressive, angiotropic large-B-cell lym-\\nphoma, typically present with fever, skin lesions, mul-\\ntifocal cerebrovascular events, and encephalopathy.\\nHowever, a vascular syndrome of the spinal cord and\\nnerve root, with paraparesis, pain, and incontinence,\\nhas also been reported, 30 and in these cases, the cer-\\nebrospinal fluid protein level is elevated and lympho-\\ncytosis is absent or minimal. There is no lymphade-\\nnopathy, splenomegaly, or marrow infiltration, but\\nextranodal sites, including the adrenal glands, are in-\\nvolved. Neurolymphomatosis typically presents as a\\nsensorimotor neuropathy.31 In this syndrome, pe-\\nripheral nerves, spinal-nerve roots, and dorsal-root\\nganglia can be infiltrated with lymphoma, and spread\\nto the leptomeninges is common. Considering the\\ndissemination of this patient\\'s disease, the epidural\\nlesion, and the cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities, I fa-\\nvor lymphomatous infiltration of nerve roots and\\nmeninges as the cause of the neurologic findings.\\nIn conclusion, my diagnosis is an aggressive, diffuse\\nnon-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, probably a diffuse large-\\nB-cell type, with bony, renal, epidural, and leptome-\\nningeal involvement and with neurolymphomatosis.\\nThe patient also had disseminated nocardiosis. The\\ndiagnostic procedure was probably a biopsy of the\\nsoft-tissue mass adjacent to the neck of the left femur.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\nMalignant tumor, disseminated.\\nDisseminated nocardiosis.\\nDR. ARNOLD S. FREEDMAN\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nDiffuse, aggressive non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, prob-\\nably a diffuse large-B-cell type, with osseous, re-\\nnal, epidural, and leptomeningeal involvement\\nand neurolymphomatosis.\\nDisseminated nocardiosis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. G. PETUR NIELSEN: The diagnostic proce-\\ndure was a needle biopsy of the soft-tissue mass in\\nthe left thigh. Microscopical examination of the spec-\\nimen revealed a densely cellular tumor infiltrating\\nthe skeletal muscle. Scattered throughout the tumor\\nwere histiocytes containing cellular debris, impart-\\ning a \"starry sky\" appearance (Fig. 5). The neoplas-\\ntic cells were of intermediate size; their nuclei varied\\nin size and shape and contained one or more prom-\\ninent eosinophilic nucleoli and numerous mitotic\\nfigures (Fig. 6). Immunohistochemical studies showed\\ndiffuse staining of the neoplastic cells for leukocyte\\ncommon antigen, the B-cell marker CD20, and a\\nmonotypic lambda immunoglobulin light chain.\\nThere was no staining for CD3, CD5, CD10, des-\\nmin, or cytokeratin. These findings confirm the diag-\\nnosis of a high-grade, Burkitt-like B-cell lymphoma.\\nMalignant lymphoma most frequently involves soft\\ntissues by direct extension or by metastatic spread-\\ning, but in rare cases it originates as a soft-tissue tu-\\nmor.32 The criteria for a primary soft-tissue sarcoma\\nare an absence of lymphoma elsewhere, an absence\\nof lymph nodes in the area, 33-35 and (according to\\nsome authors) no evidence of recurrence or spread\\nthree months after the diagnosis.33 Although these\\ncriteria were not fulfilled in this case, the clinical\\ncourse strongly suggests that the tumor originated\\nin soft tissue. In one study, primary soft-tissue lym-\\nphomas accounted for only 0.11 percent of all ma-\\nlignant lymphomas.34 Soft-tissue lymphomas arise\\nmost often in the thigh, but any site of soft tissue\\ncan be involved.33-36 The tumors generally occur in\\nelderly persons; no predilection according to sex is\\napparent. The most common initial manifestation is\\nswelling of the soft tissue, which may be painful.\\nSoft-tissue lymphomas have arisen in lymphedema\\nin some patients who have undergone mastectomy37\\nand in some patients infected with the human im-\\nmunodeficiency virus,38 and one tumor originated at\\na site of repeated intramuscular injections of bis-\\nmuth and penicillin.39 All types of lymphoma, except\\nthe lymphoblastic type, can arise in soft tissues, but\\nthe type that does so most frequently is diffuse\\nlarge-B-cell lymphoma. The histologic differential di-\\nagnosis of soft-tissue lymphomas includes a variety\\nof small round-cell tumors such as Ewing\\'s sarcoma,\\nprimitive neuroectodermal tumor, embryonal rhab-\\ndomyosarcoma, round-cell liposarcoma, and poorly\\ndifferentiated synovial sarcoma. Anaplastic large-cell\\nlymphoma can also arise in soft tissue40,41 and can\\nmimic high-grade sarcomas such as malignant fibrous\\nhistiocytoma. Soft-tissue lymphomas can be differ-\\nentiated from these other tumors by careful light-\\nmicroscopical examination in conjunction with immu-\\nnohistochemical and electron-microscopical studies\\nin selected cases.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "{'query': 'A 60-year-old woman was admitted to the hospi-\\ntal because of lumbar pain and incontinence of the\\nbladder and bowel.\\nShe had a 20-year history of low back pain with\\nradiation to the buttocks and anterior thighs, for\\nwhich she took nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.\\nThree months before admission, she had a bout of\\nback pain that persisted. One month before admis-\\nsion, the patient entered another hospital because\\nfor several weeks she had had bladder and bowel in-\\ncontinence, leg weakness, and severe pain in the\\nthighs on attempting to stand.\\nA computed tomographic (CT) scan of the lum-\\nbar spine (Fig. 1) showed abnormal epidural and\\nparaspinal soft-tissue masses at the L4 level and\\nwithin the sacral spinal canal and the possible pres-\\nence of such tissue within the sacral alae. The find-\\nings on a chest radiograph and a radionuclide bone\\nscan were normal. A CT scan of the abdomen and\\npelvis revealed a left renal mass, 1.5 cm in diameter,\\nand a right renal mass, 1 cm in diameter, that could\\nnot be further characterized. There were bilateral re-\\nnal cysts and a right adnexal cyst.\\nTreatment with dexamethasone was begun. Nee-\\ndle biopsy of the lower spine on two occasions\\nshowed no evidence of tumor. Because of the strong\\npossibility of metastatic tumor growth, a course of\\n10 fractions of palliative radiation was administered\\nto the lumbosacral spine but had no effect on the\\npain or incontinence. The patient had intermittent\\nfever, the cause of which was not discovered, al-\\nthough a repeated radiograph of the chest showed a\\nquestionable left-sided pulmonary infiltrate.\\nAntibiotics were given intravenously, with tran-\\nsient improvement. Findings on microscopical ex-\\namination of a bone-marrow specimen were normal.\\nThe patient was sent home, where she became weak-\\ner. Two days before admission to this hospital, her\\ntemperature rose to 39.4°C, with chills and confu-\\nsion. She was readmitted to the other hospital,\\nwhere a CT scan of the chest showed a necrotic cav-\\nitating mass in the periphery of the right lung; the\\nbilateral renal lesions of low attenuation appeared to\\nhave increased in size. Fluids and ceftazidime were\\nadministered, and the fever promptly resolved. The\\npatient was transferred to this hospital.\\nThe patient had a 35-pack-year history of cigarette\\nsmoking but had stopped smoking five years before\\nadmission. The aortic valve had been replaced two\\nyears before admission, and a demand pacemaker\\nhad been implanted because of a surgical complica-\\ntion during the replacement procedure. She had an-\\norexia and had lost 9 kg in weight during the three\\nmonths before admission. She took warfarin and\\nquinidine regularly and took prophylactic amoxicil-\\nlin for dental procedures. There was no history of\\ntrauma, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, sputum produc-\\ntion, or hemoptysis.\\nThe temperature was 36.5°C, the pulse was 102,\\nand the respirations were 20. The blood pressure\\nwas 110/70 mm Hg. On physical examination, the\\npatient was thin and appeared to have a chronic ill-\\nness. Crackles were audible over the lower half of the\\nleft lung and the lower quarter of the right lung. A\\ngrade 3 systolic ejection murmur was present. The\\nbreasts were normal. The findings on abdominal\\nexamination were normal. No digital clubbing was\\npresent.\\nOn neurologic examination, the first dorsal inter-\\nosseus muscles were atrophic and the legs were wast-\\ned; tone was decreased in the right leg and was\\nslightly increased in the left. Muscle strength was\\n3-/5 in the right quadriceps, 2+/5 in the right\\ngastrocnemius, and 2/5 in the right anterior tibial\\nmuscle, and was 2/5 in the left quadriceps, 2/5 in\\nthe left gastrocnemius, and 2/5 in the left anterior\\ntibial muscle. Sensation was normal. The deep-ten-\\ndon reflexes were ++ in the arms and knees, there\\nwas a left Babinski sign, and the right plantar re-\\nsponse was equivocal.\\nThe urinary sediment contained 3 to 5 red cells,\\n0 to 2 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power\\nfield. The results of laboratory tests performed at\\nthis time and subsequently are shown in Tables 1, 2,\\nand 3. A thoracolumbar CT myelographic study\\n(Fig. 2) showed no evidence of soft-tissue masses. A\\nlumbar puncture was performed (Table 4).\\nWarfarin was discontinued. Dexamethasone was\\ncontinued, and heparin, sertraline, and nystatin were\\ngiven. The temperature was usually normal but oc-\\ncasionally exceeded 37.5°C. On the third hospital\\nday, CT scans of the head and neck showed normal\\nfindings. Sodium chloride solution and pamidronate\\nwere given intravenously; thereafter, the calcium lev-\\nel ranged from 6.7 to 8.3 mg per deciliter (1.7 to\\n2.1 mmol per liter). A CT scan of the thorax (Fig.\\n3) showed multiple nodules, 1 to 4 cm in diameter,\\nthroughout the lungs and a pleural mass, 4 cm in di-\\nameter, in the right upper lobe. Urodynamic evalu-\\nation showed a neurogenic bladder with motor func-\\ntion and with preserved sensation in the bladder.\\nOn the fifth hospital day, microscopical examina-\\ntion of a specimen from a CT-guided needle biopsy\\nof the large lung mass showed numerous Nocardia\\nasteroides organisms but no malignant cells. Speci-\\nmens of blood were obtained for culture, and tri-\\nmethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was administered. The\\nnext day, a urine culture yielded gram-positive rods\\nidentified as nocardia species. Two days later, levels\\nof parathyroid hormone and parathyroid-related\\nprotein were normal. A CT scan of the abdomen\\nand pelvis showed multiple hypodense lesions, less\\nthan 3 mm in diameter; multiple minimally en-\\nhanced solid areas in the upper poles of both kid-\\nneys were unchanged. On the eighth hospital day,\\nanother lumbar puncture was performed (Table 4).\\nOn the 10th hospital day, transesophageal cardi-\\nac ultrasonography showed no valvular vegetations.\\nNerve-conduction studies of the legs and the left\\narm showed compound muscle action potentials of\\nlow amplitude in both extensor digitorum brevi,\\nwithout F responses. Needle electromyographic ex-\\namination revealed widespread active denervation in\\nthe legs and the lumbar paraspinal muscles. There\\nwas chronic bilateral denervation in the arms, with\\nactive denervation in one muscle. The findings sug-\\ngested the presence of a disorder of the motor neu-\\nrons or their roots.\\nOn the 16th hospital day, a lumbar puncture was\\nperformed (Table 4). Hematochezia occurred, and\\nthe hematocrit fell to 22.4 percent, with a white-cell\\ncount of 9800 per cubic millimeter and a platelet\\ncount of 127,000 per cubic millimeter; the hapto-\\nglobin level was normal. Two units of packed red\\ncells were transfused.\\nThe next day, a CT scan of the abdomen and pel-\\nvis, obtained before and after the intravenous ad-\\nministration of contrast material, showed cortical\\nlytic lesions with a moth-eaten appearance in the left\\niliac wing, the left femur, and both inferior pubic\\nrami. A soft-tissue mass, 4 cm in diameter, was an-\\nterior to the neck of the left femur. Radiographs of\\nthe pelvis and hips (Fig. 4) showed osteolytic lesions\\nof the head, neck, and proximal diaphysis of the left\\nfemur, with an associated soft-tissue mass.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. ARNOLD S. FREEDMAN*: May we review the\\nradiologic studies?\\nDR. GLENN D. BAREST: The CT scan of the lum-\\nbar spine obtained one month before admission\\n(Fig. 1) shows a soft-tissue mass in the left anterior\\nepidural space at the L4 level. This mass deforms the\\nthecal sac and extends through the neural foramen,\\nobliterating the normal paraspinal fat plane. The CT\\nmyelogram obtained on admission (Fig. 2) shows\\nresolution of the abnormal soft-tissue mass.\\nThe CT scan of the chest obtained two days after\\nadmission (Fig. 3) reveals a cavitary mass, 4 cm in\\ndiameter, in the right upper lobe and multiple small\\nnodules in both lungs, without mediastinal lym-\\nphadenopathy. A CT scan of the abdomen obtained\\nthe next day without intravenously administered\\ncontrast material shows bilateral, nonenhancing sol-\\nid renal masses and multiple, very small hepatic le-\\nsions. A subsequent CT scan of the abdomen and\\npelvis shows, in addition, cortical lytic lesions in the\\nleft pelvic bones and femur. Radiographic examina-\\ntion of the left hip (Fig. 4) shows osteolytic lesions\\nof the femur and a large associated soft-tissue mass\\nwithout a periosteal reaction.\\nDR. FREEDMAN: The differential diagnosis in this\\ncase comprises diseases that lead to disseminated no-\\ncardiosis. Nocardia organisms can infect immuno-\\ncompetent persons, but most affected patients have\\nunderlying diseases involving abnormalities of cellu-\\nlar immunity or, less often, disorders of the leuko-\\ncytes and humoral immunity (Table 5).1,2\\nWas disseminated nocardiosis responsible for the\\nepidural mass, lytic bone lesions, neurologic symp-\\ntoms, and renal lesions in this patient? She presented\\nwith fever and pulmonary lesions after dexametha-\\nsone and radiation therapy had been given to treat\\nan epidural mass. The pulmonary cavitary mass was\\nnoted at least two to three weeks after the patient\\nbegan to take corticosteroids. Moreover, the initial\\nCT scans of the lumbar spine and abdomen showed\\nepidural and renal lesions. In more than 70 percent\\nof cases, nocardial infection originates in the lungs,\\nand it may affect contiguous soft tissues and bone. 1,2\\nThe next site of most frequent involvement, as the\\ninfection progresses, is the central nervous system,\\nfollowed by the skin and soft tissues, with hematog-\\nenous dissemination. Osteomyelitis due to nocardia\\nis uncommon; only 12 cases had been reported be-\\nfore 1987.3 The vertebral bodies were involved in\\nthree of these cases, and the osteomyelitis was man-\\nifested most often as collapse and less often as an\\nepidural mass causing compression of the spinal cord.\\nThe patient under discussion had no radiographic\\nabnormalities of the spine.\\nNocardial infection involves the central nervous\\nsystem in 20 to 40 percent of patients, most often\\nin the form of brain abscesses; isolated meningitis in\\nthe absence of brain abscess is uncommon.4 The\\npredominant finding in this patient was motor-neu-\\nron dysfunction, without meningeal signs and with\\nnormal findings on a CT scan of the head. Eighty-\\nthree percent of patients with nocardia meningitis\\nhave neutrophilic pleocytosis, 64 percent have hy-\\npoglycorrhachia, and 61 percent have a cerebrospi-\\nnal fluid protein level greater than 100 mg per dec-\\niliter. In this case, a urine culture yielded nocardia\\norganisms, but the renal masses were probably not\\nabscesses caused by nocardial infection, since they\\nappeared before the pulmonary lesions and since re-\\nnal masses are not commonly caused by nocardia.2\\nAlthough the lesions in the liver were small, hepatic\\ninvolvement in nocardial infection has been reported\\nin 3 percent of cases and may have been part of the\\ndisseminated infection in this patient.2 Since this pa-\\ntient had undergone aortic-valve replacement, pros-\\nthetic-valve endocarditis due to nocardia was con-\\nsidered part of a disseminated nocardial infection.\\nProsthetic-valve involvement in nocardial infection\\nhas been reported only rarely,5 but when it occurs,\\nit usually does so soon after valve replacement, and\\nthe patients have positive blood cultures for the or-\\nganism and normal echocardiographic findings.\\nThe differential diagnosis of this patient\\'s purely\\nlytic bone disease includes infectious diseases, neo-\\nplasms, and disorders that fit in neither category. Os-\\nteomyelitis usually does not cause purely lytic lesions\\nwithout a periosteal reaction and positive findings on\\na bone scan. The microbiologic data do not suggest\\na second infection. Skeletal tuberculosis is also unlike-\\nly in this case,6 since it most commonly affects the\\nspine, followed by the proximal femur. Although a\\nparavertebral abscess can form with spinal cord com-\\npression, the adjacent bone and disk typically show\\nsigns of a destructive process. This patient\\'s renal le-\\nsions were also not typical of those associated with tu-\\nberculosis, which include calcifications, destruction of\\ncollecting systems, and cavitary lesions. The patient\\ndid not have pyuria, and the cultures for tuberculosis\\nwere negative. Her neurologic symptoms did not in-\\nclude headache, meningismus, or changes in mental\\nstatus. Although the final sample of cerebrospinal flu-\\nid showed an elevated level of protein and a low level\\nof glucose, the absence of pleocytosis makes tubercu-\\nlous meningitis unlikely. Tuberculosis and nocardiosis\\ncan coexist, and in 1 to 6 percent of patients with tu-\\nberculosis, nocardia is cultured from sputum.7 How-\\never, no tubercle bacilli were detected in this patient.\\nA noninfectious, non-neoplastic disorder is an un-\\nlikely diagnosis. Chronic sarcoidosis can cause lytic,\\nsclerotic, and permeative bone lesions affecting main-\\nly the small bones of the hands and occasionally the\\npelvic bones and vertebrae. Affected patients almost\\nalways have lung and skin involvement.8 Hypercalce-\\nmia is due to increased production of calcitriol by\\nmacrophages. Neurologic symptoms occur in about\\n5 percent of cases; there may be involvement of the\\nleptomeninges, often accompanied by cranial-nerve\\npalsies. Langerhans\\'-cell histiocytoses can cause lytic\\nbone lesions, but this type of histiocytosis usually\\noccurs in children or adolescents, typically boys, and\\ntherefore would be an unlikely diagnosis in this case.\\nThe diagnosis of a widespread malignant tumor is\\nmost consistent with this patient\\'s presentation. The\\nclinical features that are important in the differential\\ndiagnosis are the epidural mass affecting lumbosacral\\nnerve roots, lytic bone lesions, renal masses, and the\\nabsence of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. A\\nlimited number of cancers cause purely lytic bone\\nlesions: renal-cell, lung, uterine, adrenocortical, and\\nthyroid carcinomas; multiple myeloma; and Hodg-\\nkin\\'s disease and non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma.10-12 None\\nof the findings suggested that this patient had a uter-\\nine, adrenocortical, or thyroid carcinoma, and except\\nfor hematuria, no findings suggested the diagnosis of\\nrenal-cell carcinoma. The renal masses were bilateral,\\nand synchronous bilateral renal-cell carcinoma occurs\\nin only 2 to 4 percent of cases. It is also unlikely that\\nthis patient had lung cancer, despite her long history\\nof smoking and the known association of lung cancer\\nwith nocardial infection. A needle biopsy of the lung\\nmass showed no malignant cells, and the diagnostic\\naccuracy of CT-guided needle biopsy of a 4-cm lung\\nmass exceeds 90 percent. 13 The epidural mass was not\\nassociated with an adjacent destructive lesion of the\\nvertebral bodies, so the mass was probably not a me-\\ntastasis of a solid tumor. Its regression after radiation\\ntherapy appeared to be complete, indicating that the\\ntumor was very sensitive to radiation.\\nThe moth-eaten appearance of the pelvis and fe-\\nmur in this case is characteristic of multiple myelo-\\nma.10 The patient had hypercalcemia, and the serum\\ncreatinine level rose after intravenous administration\\nof contrast material, as is often seen in patients with\\nmyeloma. However, the degree of bone marrow\\nplasmacytosis was less than 10 percent, there was no\\nclear evidence of a serum M component, and the\\nimmunoglobulin levels were not depressed. The low\\nlevel of IgG lambda M component may be a sign of\\nmonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined impor-\\ntance. Although the epidural mass might be an extra-\\ndural plasmacytoma, myeloma that causes compres-\\nsion of the epidural spinal cord is usually associated\\nwith destructive lesions in the spine.\\nThe diagnosis that best explains the epidural and\\nassociated paraspinal mass, bone lesions, and renal\\nmasses is lymphoma, which commonly leads to no-\\ncardiosis. In three large series of patients with pul-\\nmonary and systemic nocardiosis, 29 to 54 percent\\nof the patients had lymphoma,1,14,15 and virtually all\\nof them received either chemotherapy or radiation\\ntherapy as well as corticosteroids.\\nEpidural Hodgkin\\'s disease is an unusual cause of\\nspinal cord compression. Most affected patients have\\nantecedent Hodgkin\\'s disease,16 which is believed to\\nreach the epidural space through the vertebral fora-\\nmen from paravertebral or bony masses. Hodgkin\\'s\\ndisease involves bone in 10 to 15 percent of cases\\nbut is seen at presentation in only 1 percent. 10,17 Sites\\nof bony involvement are the vertebrae, pelvis, or\\nproximal femur in 75 percent of cases, and 75 per-\\ncent of bony lesions are lytic, usually with a perme-\\native or moth-eaten appearance.10 In one large series,\\nhowever, only 14 percent of the lesions were entirely\\nlytic.11 Sixty percent of patients with Hodgkin\\'s dis-\\nease that involves the bone have constitutional symp-\\ntoms. Hodgkin\\'s disease can involve the kidneys, as\\nreported in 7 to 17 percent of cases at autopsy, and\\nusually both kidneys are diffusely enlarged. The ab-\\nsence of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in this\\ncase is uncharacteristic of Hodgkin\\'s disease.\\nSpinal cord compression occurs in 0.1 to 10 per-\\ncent of patients with non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma. 18-22\\nAs in this case, there may be no radiographic evi-\\ndence of paravertebral or vertebral involvement. 23\\nFurthermore, many patients who present with epi-\\ndural lymphoma have disseminated disease. Back pain\\nis usually present for several months before more\\nacute neurologic symptoms develop. The thoracic\\nlevel of the spine is involved most frequently, fol-\\nlowed by the lumbar and cervical levels. Diffuse\\nlarge-B-cell lymphoma is seen in 60 to 70 percent of\\npatients; follicular lymphoma is less common.\\nBone lesions are present in 4 percent of patients\\nat the time of the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin\\'s lym-\\nphoma, in 15 percent at some time during the\\ncourse of their disease, and in more than 60 percent\\nat autopsy.10 In some series, the proportion of pa-\\ntients with lytic bony lesions is greater than that in\\nHodgkin\\'s disease.\\nRenal involvement in non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma\\noccurs by either hematogenous spreading or, less of-\\nten (in 2 to 14 percent of patients), by direct exten-\\nsion.24 In some autopsy series, renal involvement has\\nbeen seen in as many as half the cases. The involve-\\nment is bilateral in at least 40 percent of patients\\nwith affected kidneys and forms multiple masses in\\nabout half of them. Solitary masses or diffuse en-\\nlargement occurs in about 20 percent of cases. Dif-\\nfuse large-B-cell lymphoma is the most common\\ntype of non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma that involves the\\nkidneys. Most patients have constitutional symptoms,\\nan elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level, nor-\\nmal renal function, and multiple extranodal sites of\\ndisease. In several series, renal involvement has been\\nassociated with widespread bone disease.\\nSeveral results of this patient\\'s laboratory studies\\ndeserve comment. The patient had a normochromic,\\nnormocytic anemia, which is present in about 30\\npercent of patients with non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma\\nat the time of the diagnosis. An elevated serum lac-\\ntate dehydrogenase level is reported in 50 percent of\\npatients with diffuse, aggressive non-Hodgkin\\'s lym-\\nphoma and in about 10 percent of patients with in-\\ndolent lymphoma. The elevation of the lactate dehy-\\ndrogenase level accompanies the transformation from\\na follicular to a diffuse aggressive form and indicates\\na poor prognosis. In this patient, the lactate dehy-\\ndrogenase level was high and rose rapidly, which is\\nunusual in Hodgkin\\'s disease. An elevated ferritin\\nlevel has also been reported in patients with ad-\\nvanced non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma.25 Patients with\\ndiffuse large-B-cell lymphoma have the highest ele-\\nvations of ferritin; those with small lymphocytic or\\nfollicular lymphoma have much lower levels. Eleva-\\ntions of serum B12 (bound to transcobalamin II)\\nhave been reported in patients with lymphoma26 as\\nwell as those with metastatic solid tumors, multiple\\nmyeloma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Hyper-\\ncalcemia occurs in 30 percent of patients with dif-\\nfuse, aggressive non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma but in\\nonly 1 to 2 percent of patients with indolent lym-\\nphoma.27 In about 40 percent of cases of non-\\nHodgkin\\'s lymphoma, the hypercalcemia is related\\nto elevated calcitriol levels. The normal levels of se-\\nrum parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hor-\\nmone-related protein in this patient are consistent\\nwith the presence of calcitriol-mediated hypercalce-\\nmia and provide stronger support for a diagnosis of\\ndiffuse aggressive non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma than\\nfor a diagnosis of indolent non-Hodgkin\\'s lympho-\\nma or Hodgkin\\'s disease.\\nHow can lymphoma account for the neurologic\\nfeatures of this case? The epidural lesion at L4 could\\nexplain the elevated level of cerebrospinal fluid pro-\\ntein and, with accompanying root compression, the\\nleg weakness and incontinence. Intramedullary lym-\\nphoma could produce upper and lower motor-neu-\\nron signs, but it would also affect sensation, re-\\nsulting in a spinal sensory level on examination. In\\nintramedullary lymphoma, the spinal cord is usually\\nenlarged, and the cerebrospinal fluid is cellular. In\\nthis case, the myelographic study did not reveal such\\na lesion. Leptomeningeal lymphoma would be ex-\\npected to have diffuse manifestations, including me-\\nningeal signs, cranial-nerve involvement, sensory loss,\\nand cerebral symptoms. An elevated protein level\\nand a low glucose level, as found in the cerebro-\\nspinal fluid examined on the 16th hospital day, are\\nconsistent with the presence of leptomeningeal lym-\\nphoma. Although the cytologic examination was in-\\nconclusive, the degenerated cell is a suspicious find-\\ning. Use of a polymerase-chain-reaction assay to detect\\na rearrangement of the immunoglobulin or T-cell-\\nreceptor gene would have a higher sensitivity for\\nidentifying a clonal population of neoplastic lymph-\\noid cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. 28\\nSubacute motor neuronopathy involving the low-\\ner motor neurons, which occurs with Hodgkin\\'s dis-\\nease and non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, could explain\\nthis patient\\'s weakness and muscle atrophy, but in\\nsubacute motor neuropathy, fasciculations are com-\\nmon, pain and upper-motor-neuron findings are un-\\nusual, and deep-tendon reflexes are absent.29 Wheth-\\ner amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is associated with\\nlymphoproliferative disorders is controversial, but it\\ncould explain the upper- and lower-motor-neuron\\nsigns and the elevated protein level in the cerebro-\\nspinal fluid. More than half of patients with amyo-\\ntrophic lateral sclerosis have paraproteinemia, with\\nhigh titers of antiglycolipid antibodies in some cases.\\nThe Guillain-Barré syndrome is associated with lym-\\nphoproliferative diseases, but if the patient under\\ndiscussion had this disorder, one would expect an\\nabsence of reflexes, more evidence of clinical progres-\\nsion, and an elevated protein level in the first sample\\nof cerebrospinal fluid examined. There were no sen-\\nsory signs or autonomic dysfunction.\\nPatients with intravascular lymphomatosis, which\\nis due to an aggressive, angiotropic large-B-cell lym-\\nphoma, typically present with fever, skin lesions, mul-\\ntifocal cerebrovascular events, and encephalopathy.\\nHowever, a vascular syndrome of the spinal cord and\\nnerve root, with paraparesis, pain, and incontinence,\\nhas also been reported, 30 and in these cases, the cer-\\nebrospinal fluid protein level is elevated and lympho-\\ncytosis is absent or minimal. There is no lymphade-\\nnopathy, splenomegaly, or marrow infiltration, but\\nextranodal sites, including the adrenal glands, are in-\\nvolved. Neurolymphomatosis typically presents as a\\nsensorimotor neuropathy.31 In this syndrome, pe-\\nripheral nerves, spinal-nerve roots, and dorsal-root\\nganglia can be infiltrated with lymphoma, and spread\\nto the leptomeninges is common. Considering the\\ndissemination of this patient\\'s disease, the epidural\\nlesion, and the cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities, I fa-\\nvor lymphomatous infiltration of nerve roots and\\nmeninges as the cause of the neurologic findings.\\nIn conclusion, my diagnosis is an aggressive, diffuse\\nnon-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, probably a diffuse large-\\nB-cell type, with bony, renal, epidural, and leptome-\\nningeal involvement and with neurolymphomatosis.\\nThe patient also had disseminated nocardiosis. The\\ndiagnostic procedure was probably a biopsy of the\\nsoft-tissue mass adjacent to the neck of the left femur.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\nMalignant tumor, disseminated.\\nDisseminated nocardiosis.\\nDR. ARNOLD S. FREEDMAN\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nDiffuse, aggressive non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, prob-\\nably a diffuse large-B-cell type, with osseous, re-\\nnal, epidural, and leptomeningeal involvement\\nand neurolymphomatosis.\\nDisseminated nocardiosis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. G. PETUR NIELSEN: The diagnostic proce-\\ndure was a needle biopsy of the soft-tissue mass in\\nthe left thigh. Microscopical examination of the spec-\\nimen revealed a densely cellular tumor infiltrating\\nthe skeletal muscle. Scattered throughout the tumor\\nwere histiocytes containing cellular debris, impart-\\ning a \"starry sky\" appearance (Fig. 5). The neoplas-\\ntic cells were of intermediate size; their nuclei varied\\nin size and shape and contained one or more prom-\\ninent eosinophilic nucleoli and numerous mitotic\\nfigures (Fig. 6). Immunohistochemical studies showed\\ndiffuse staining of the neoplastic cells for leukocyte\\ncommon antigen, the B-cell marker CD20, and a\\nmonotypic lambda immunoglobulin light chain.\\nThere was no staining for CD3, CD5, CD10, des-\\nmin, or cytokeratin. These findings confirm the diag-\\nnosis of a high-grade, Burkitt-like B-cell lymphoma.\\nMalignant lymphoma most frequently involves soft\\ntissues by direct extension or by metastatic spread-\\ning, but in rare cases it originates as a soft-tissue tu-\\nmor.32 The criteria for a primary soft-tissue sarcoma\\nare an absence of lymphoma elsewhere, an absence\\nof lymph nodes in the area, 33-35 and (according to\\nsome authors) no evidence of recurrence or spread\\nthree months after the diagnosis.33 Although these\\ncriteria were not fulfilled in this case, the clinical\\ncourse strongly suggests that the tumor originated\\nin soft tissue. In one study, primary soft-tissue lym-\\nphomas accounted for only 0.11 percent of all ma-\\nlignant lymphomas.34 Soft-tissue lymphomas arise\\nmost often in the thigh, but any site of soft tissue\\ncan be involved.33-36 The tumors generally occur in\\nelderly persons; no predilection according to sex is\\napparent. The most common initial manifestation is\\nswelling of the soft tissue, which may be painful.\\nSoft-tissue lymphomas have arisen in lymphedema\\nin some patients who have undergone mastectomy37\\nand in some patients infected with the human im-\\nmunodeficiency virus,38 and one tumor originated at\\na site of repeated intramuscular injections of bis-\\nmuth and penicillin.39 All types of lymphoma, except\\nthe lymphoblastic type, can arise in soft tissues, but\\nthe type that does so most frequently is diffuse\\nlarge-B-cell lymphoma. The histologic differential di-\\nagnosis of soft-tissue lymphomas includes a variety\\nof small round-cell tumors such as Ewing\\'s sarcoma,\\nprimitive neuroectodermal tumor, embryonal rhab-\\ndomyosarcoma, round-cell liposarcoma, and poorly\\ndifferentiated synovial sarcoma. Anaplastic large-cell\\nlymphoma can also arise in soft tissue40,41 and can\\nmimic high-grade sarcomas such as malignant fibrous\\nhistiocytoma. Soft-tissue lymphomas can be differ-\\nentiated from these other tumors by careful light-\\nmicroscopical examination in conjunction with immu-\\nnohistochemical and electron-microscopical studies\\nin selected cases.', 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"WORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with disseminated nocardiosis, likely with renal involvement.\\nDISEASE_NAME: Lymphoma\\n\\nReasoning:\\n\\n1.  **Information Gathering:**\\n\\n    *   **Key Signs/Symptoms:** Lumbar pain, incontinence of bladder and bowel, history of back pain, leg weakness, fever, confusion, pulmonary infiltrate, renal masses, neurological deficits (weakness, atrophy, decreased reflexes, Babinski sign).\\n    *   **Duration:** Symptoms have been present for several months, with recent worsening.\\n    *   **Epidemiologic Context:** No specific travel history mentioned, but the patient is a 60-year-old woman.\\n    *   **Comorbidities/Medications:** History of aortic valve replacement, pacemaker, warfarin, quinidine, prophylactic amoxicillin, and recent dexamethasone and radiation therapy.\\n    *   **Red-Flag Features:** Fever, confusion, neurological deficits, renal masses, and the patient's age.\\n\\n2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\\n\\n    *   **Anatomical System:** The patient presents with a wide range of symptoms affecting multiple systems, including the spine, neurological system, lungs, and kidneys.\\n    *   **Timing/Progression:** The symptoms have been present for several months, with a recent worsening.

The patient was afebrile and euvolemic. His medications included zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir. A computed tomographic scan with the intravenous administration of contrast medium, obtained to assess the possibility of appendicitis and retroperitoneal bleeding, revealed a mildly dilated right renal collecting system. This finding was confirmed by x-ray examination of the kidneys and upper bladder (Panel A), which provides a view equivalent to that of intravenous pyelography. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.010, a pH of 5.0, and more than 50 red cells per high-power field. Compensated polarizing microscopy showed indinavir crystals in the urine (Panel B, ×100). To reduce the risk that the patient's strains of human immunodeficiency virus would become resistant if indinavir were withdrawn from the treatment regimen, the patient was instructed to continue taking the drug and to increase his fluid intake. Although his pain decreased initially, crystalluria persisted, and several weeks later, he returned with flank pain and hematuria. Ultrasonography at this time confirmed the development of several renal calculi. Treatment with indinavir was discontinued, and nelfinavir was added to his regimen of zidovudine and lamivudine. The renal calculi and crystalluria resolved spontaneously, and the patient was well at the time of the most recent follow-up visit. ©1999, Massachusetts Medical Society. JACK W. TSAO, M.D., D.PHIL.

ELLENDER, Assistant Editors\\n\\nCase 17-1999\\n\\nPRESENTATION OF CASE\\nA 42-year-old asplenic man was admitted to the\\nhospital because of gram-negative sepsis.\\nThe patient had been well until one week earlier,\\nwhen his left upper teeth began to ache. Four days\\nbefore admission, he had abdominal cramps and two\\nloose stools. The next morning, he awakened with\\ndiffuse aches, especially in the arms, legs, and lower\\nback. After a small breakfast, he vomited several\\ntimes and then had shaking chills with increasing fe-\\nver. He was admitted to another hospital. His tem-\\nperature was 40°C. The results of a physical exami-\\nnation were otherwise normal. The urine was normal.\\nLaboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2).\\nThoracic and abdominal radiographs showed normal\\nfindings. A blood specimen was cultured. Ceftriax-\\none and ampicillin and ampicillin-sulbactam were\\ngiven intravenously.\\nOn the second hospital day, the patient vomited\\n500 ml of blood and had intense pains in his feet\\nand fingers. Examination revealed hypotension, with\\npetechiae and purpura on the hands, feet, face, and\\nchest. The urinary volume declined to 10 ml per\\nhour. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and\\n2). Radiographs of the chest showed normal find-\\nings. Fresh-frozen plasma and platelets were trans-\\nfused. Single doses of gentamicin, clindamycin, and\\nvancomycin were given intravenously, and a drip in-\\nfusion of dobutamine was started.\\nOn the next day, the patient was hemodynamical-\\nly stable and well oxygenated, and the dobutamine\\nwas discontinued. Oliguria persisted. Laboratory tests\\nwere performed (Tables 1 and 2). The blood culture\\nyielded anaerobic gram-negative rods. A single dose\\nof cefotaxime was administered. On the following\\nday, the patient was transferred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was a heavy-equipment operator. He\\nhad had a partial gastrectomy and a splenectomy af-\\nter receiving multiple stab wounds 19 years before\\nadmission. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes\\ndaily for many years; he had discontinued his cus-\\ntomary heavy alcohol intake five months before ad-\\nmission. He had last received an injection of pneu-\\nmococcal vaccine 16 years before admission, and he\\nhad not seen a physician since then. There was a his-\\ntory of periodontal disease with toothaches but no\\nrecent dental care. He had frequent foot blisters that\\nhe drained with a nonsterile pin, after which his two\\ndogs licked his feet; this had occurred as recently as\\ntwo days before his illness. Other household pets were\\ntwo cats, a cockatiel, a chinchilla, and a rabbit.\\nThe temperature was 36.6°C, the pulse was 82,\\nand the respirations were 22. The blood pressure\\nwas 120/70 mm Hg.\\nExamination showed purpuric lesions, several of\\nwhich were palpable, on the face, arms, and legs and\\na right conjunctival hemorrhage. No petechiae, sub-\\nungual splinter hemorrhages, or enlarged lymph\\nnodes were found. There was periodontal disease,\\nwithout local tenderness. The lungs were clear ex-\\ncept for bibasilar crackles. The muscles were diffuse-\\nly tender. A stool specimen was positive for occult\\nblood. The results of a neurologic examination were\\nnormal.\\nThe urine was amber and cloudy and was positive\\nfor protein (++) and bile (+); the sediment con-\\ntained 20 to 50 red cells; 3 to 5 white cells, includ-\\ning eosinophils; and a few bacteria per high-power\\nfield. The results of other laboratory tests are shown\\nin Tables 1 and 2. An electrocardiogram showed a nor-\\nmal rhythm at a rate of 90 and a pattern of left ven-\\ntricular hypertrophy. A thoracic radiograph showed\\nbibasilar patchy and linear opacities that were consis-\\ntent with the presence of pulmonary edema, pneu-\\nmonia, or atelectasis. Abdominal radiographs showed\\nnormal findings.\\nSpecimens of blood, sputum, urine, and stool were\\nobtained for culture. Cefotaxime and metronidazole\\nwere given intravenously. The temperature rose to\\n37.4°C.\\nOn the second hospital day, the axillary tempera-\\nture rose to 38.2°C, and icterus was noted. The urine\\nwas orange and was positive for protein (+++) and\\nbile (+). The sediment contained 20 to 50 red cells,\\n3 to 5 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power\\nfield and 3 to 5 granular casts per low-power field.\\nThe results of other laboratory tests are shown in Ta-\\nbles 1 and 2. Transfusions of packed red cells and\\nplatelets were given.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. JEFFREY PARSONNET*: I shall begin my dis-\\ncussion by examining host factors that may have pre-\\ndisposed this man to overwhelming infection. His\\nmost obvious immunodeficiency is asplenism. Sple-\\nnectomy decreases the capacity of the reticuloen-\\ndothelial cells to clear microorganisms from the\\nblood, thereby predisposing patients to rapidly fatal\\ninfections. Asplenic patients are highly susceptible to\\ninfection with encapsulated bacteria, such as Strep-\\ntococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and\\nNeisseria meningitidis, because of deficient produc-\\ntion of antibodies to T-cell-independent antigens,\\nsuch as the polysaccharide components of bacterial\\ncapsules. Such patients are also prone to severe in-\\nfection with Capnocytophaga canimorsus, some gram-\\nnegative enteric organisms, and the babesia species\\nof protozoa. Another host factor in this patient is his\\nhistory of heavy alcohol use. He received no medical\\ncare for many years, so he may have had alcoholic\\nliver disease, although there was no physical evidence\\nof it. Liver disease would have further impaired his\\nreticuloendothelial system, and ongoing, heavy con-\\nsumption of alcohol could have decreased his resist-\\nance to bacterial infection by causing granulocyte\\ndysfunction.¹ In addition, periodontal disease predis-\\nposed him to various infectious complications, in\\nwhich anaerobic bacteria figure prominently. Finally,\\nhe had self-induced impairment of the most impor-\\ntant defense against infection, intact skin, which may\\nhave been breached during its lavage with canine oral\\nsecretions.\\nSeveral epidemiologic factors may be important in\\nthis case, including exposure to various common and\\nexotic pets. A zoonosis must be seriously considered,\\nwith percutaneous inoculation the most likely mode\\nof transmission of infectious agents. The most inti-\\nmate exposure was to the saliva of dogs, which con-\\ntains various aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, most no-\\ntably Pasteurella multocida, but also bacteroides and\\nfusobacterium species.2 The patient\\'s other animals\\ncould have transmitted many pathogenic bacteria, in-\\ncluding P. multocida, species of campylobacter and\\nsalmonella, and the agents of tularemia, plague, and\\nrat-bite fever. Also transmissible are several species of\\ncapnocytophaga that inhabit the oral cavity in dogs,\\ncats, and rabbits and can cause serious infections,\\nparticularly in immunocompromised hosts. None of\\nthese organisms are true anaerobes, although campy-\\nlobacters are microaerophilic, and capnocytophaga\\nspecies are classified as facultative anaerobes.\\nThe patient\\'s history of smoking and his con-\\nstruction work would be important factors if he had\\na primary pulmonary source of infection, but his\\npulmonary infiltrates were probably due to septic\\nshock.\\nWhat aspects of this patient\\'s clinical presentation\\nsuggest a primary source of bacteremia? Most of the\\nsymptoms and signs are nonspecific, common man-\\nifestations of the systemic inflammatory response syn-\\ndrome, which includes the sepsis syndrome.3 Among\\nthese manifestations were vomiting and diarrhea, my-\\nalgias, fever, rigors, and jaundice. Myalgias and back\\npain are especially frequent in cases of infective en-\\ndocarditis, rickettsial infection, and, in my experience,\\nstaphylococcal bacteremia. Jaundice is a common\\nfeature of sepsis; it is caused by diverse mechanisms,\\nincluding an inability to excrete conjugated biliru-\\nbin.4 A more specific manifestation of this patient\\'s\\nillness may be the aching in his teeth, which could\\nhave been an early symptom of a dentoalveolar in-\\nfection, periodontal infection, maxillary sinusitis, or a\\ncombination of these disorders. Anaerobic bacteria,\\nespecially fusobacterium and pigmented bacteroides\\nspecies (including porphyromonas and prevotella,\\nwhich have recently been classified as genera), are\\nprimary pathogens in odontogenic infections. Several\\nspecies of capnocytophaga may also be involved in\\nperiodontal infection and may cause sepsis in immu-\\nnocompromised hosts and focal or disseminated\\ninfections in normal hosts. In this case, however, sev-\\neral physical examinations revealed only chronic per-\\niodontal disease, and the patient had a long history\\nof toothaches. I suspect that they were unrelated to\\nhis sepsis.\\nTherefore, the primary source of infection in this\\npatient could have been percutaneous inoculation of\\nskin flora, oral flora, or even gastrointestinal tract\\nflora. The vomiting and diarrhea were probably non-\\nspecific manifestations of sepsis, but we must re-\\nmember that intraabdominal infection is the most\\ncommon cause of bacteremia due to gram-negative\\nanaerobic bacilli.\\nUnder these circumstances, a complementary di-\\nagnostic approach is to consider the gram-negative\\nanaerobic bacilli that can cause sepsis and then merge\\nthose results with the clinical findings. Bacteroides\\nspecies are important constituents of normal human\\nflora, and Bacteroides fragilis is the most commonly\\ndocumented cause of anaerobic bacteremia. Bacteroi-\\ndes and prevotella species achieve high concentra-\\ntions in tonsillar crypts, gingival crevices, and the\\ncolon. The special importance of B. fragilis as a\\npathogen has been attributed to the role of its dis-\\ntinct polysaccharide capsule, which promotes ab-\\ncess formation.5 The finding of B. fragilis in the\\nblood suggests an intraabdominal infection, which\\nis most likely to be polymicrobial. Bacteroides bac-\\nteremia itself does not usually result in sepsis be-\\ncause of the relatively low virulence of its endotoxin,\\nbut other organisms involved in polymicrobial infec-\\ntions, particularly gram-negative aerobes, can cause\\nsepsis.\\nDespite the predominance of bacteroides as an an-\\naerobic blood isolate, this patient\\'s illness was not\\nsuggestive of an intraabdominal infection. However,\\nI would have continued treatment with an antibiotic\\n(such as metronidazole) that is effective against most\\nstrains of B. fragilis until the culture results became\\navailable.\\nPorphyromonas gingivalis is a common periodontal\\npathogen in humans, and several species of porphy-\\nromonas are frequently found in properly cultured\\nwounds from cat or dog bites. However, this organ-\\nism is unlikely to cause an infection as severe as that\\nin this patient. Similarly, assorted prevotella species\\ncause infections of the oral cavity, sinuses, lower res-\\npiratory tract, and female genital tract, but isolation\\nof these organisms from the bloodstream is unusual,\\nand overwhelming sepsis would be an uncharacter-\\nistic manifestation of such an infection.\\nMore deserving of consideration are Fusobacteri-\\num nucleatum and F. necrophorum, which are also\\ncommon constituents of oral flora but are more like-\\nly to cause serious infections than P. gingivalis is.\\nF. necrophorum is the cause of Lemierre\\'s syndrome,\\nor postanginal sepsis, which is associated with bac-\\nteremia and septic jugular-vein thrombophlebitis.7\\nOdontogenic infection with F. nucleatum can also\\ncause severe illness. Both species can be isolated from\\ncultures in patients with anaerobic lung infections,\\nand these organisms can cause endocarditis and fatal\\nsepsis. In the light of this patient\\'s toothache and\\nperiodontal disease, infection with fusobacterium\\ncannot be discounted, although the paucity of find-\\nings in the head and neck makes it an unlikely di-\\nagnosis.\\nThe possibility of infection with a bacterium of\\nthe genus campylobacter merits consideration, be-\\ncause infections with such organisms as a result of\\nexposure to animals often cause diarrheal and sys-\\ntemic illnesses. Campylobacter organisms are com-\\nmon commensals in the gastrointestinal tracts of cats\\nand dogs. Some strains cause enteric infections,\\nwhich may be severe. Bacteremia, endocarditis, and\\nother serious complications may ensue, but septic\\nshock is uncharacteristic of the strains that cause en-\\nteric illness. Campylobacter fetus is more likely to cause\\nbacteremia and secondary infection of organs, which\\nmay be fatal, particularly in persons with impaired\\ncell-mediated immunity. However, the patient under\\ndiscussion had no predisposition to this infection.\\nFurthermore, campylobacter organisms are micro-\\naerophilic and are unlikely to be classified as anaer-\\nobes in a report from a microbiology laboratory.\\nThe possibility of C. fetus infection cannot be ruled\\nout in this patient, but it would be an unusually se-\\nvere case, even if the liver disease were worse than\\nthe physical examinations suggested.\\nC. canimorsus causes the type of infection this pa-\\ntient had and is associated with the host factors and\\ncircumstances described in this case. Capnocytopha-\\nga species are long, thin, gram-negative rods that are\\nfacultative anaerobes, but they grow best in an at-\\nmosphere enriched with carbon dioxide, from which\\nthe name of the genus is derived; it means \"eater of\\ncarbon dioxide.\" Several strains colonize the subgin-\\ngival sulcus in healthy adults. These strains can cause\\nsepsis in immunocompromised patients, particularly\\nthose with granulocytopenia or an underlying hema-\\ntologic tumor that is malignant.10 Sepsis is less likely\\nto develop in immunocompetent patients, but they\\nmay have disseminated infection, including endocar-\\nditis. Overwhelming sepsis, however, has not been\\nreported in association with splenectomy or alcoholic\\ncirrhosis.\\nIn contrast, C. canimorsus (Latin for \"dog bite\"),\\nwhich is part of the normal oral flora of dogs, cats,\\nand other animals, is known to cause septic shock in\\nimmunocompromised patients. This organism, for-\\nmerly known as group DF-2, was first identified as a\\ncause of sepsis in 1976.11 A second strain, C. супо-\\ndegmi (Greek for \"dog bite\"), has also been isolated\\nfrom patients with infections that followed dog\\nbites. These organisms have been the subject of nu-\\nmerous reviews12-15 and case reports.16-29 Infections\\nwith C. canimorsus occur predominantly in adults,\\nmore often in men (72 percent of cases) than in\\nwomen, and most patients have been either bitten\\nby or otherwise exposed to dogs. In many cases, the\\nexposure has been trivial. C. canimorsus sepsis has\\nbeen associated with asplenia (in 38 percent of cas-\\nes) and a history of alcohol abuse (in 30 percent),\\nalthough cases have been reported in which there\\nwas no apparent predisposing factor.\\nC. canimorsus infection causes mild-to-fulminant\\ndisease. The rate of mortality from bacteremia is ap-\\nproximately 30 percent. In both normal and asplenic\\npersons, shock, renal failure, the acute respiratory\\ndistress syndrome, and peripheral gangrene are com-\\nmon complications of bacteremia, and disseminated\\nintravascular coagulation occurs in more than one\\nthird of infected patients.13,14,16,17,19,22,26-28 Numerous\\ninvestigators have reported syndromes of purpura\\nfulminans; endocarditis has also been reported. The\\npathogenesis of capnocytophaga infections remains\\npoorly understood.\\nThis patient\\'s exposure to animals, compromised\\nimmunity, and illness are highly characteristic of in-\\nfection with C. canimorsus (or C. cynodegmi). This\\ndiagnosis would not explain the patient\\'s report of\\ntoothache, and it disregards the initial report of an-\\naerobes in the blood culture. C. canimorsus and\\nC. cynodegmi are frequently identified initially as\\nanaerobes.\\nDespite treatment for 72 hours with numerous\\nantibiotics, several of which should have been suf-\\nficient to treat the organisms I have discussed, this\\npatient remained severely ill. Infection of immuno-\\ncompromised hosts with C. canimorsus can itself be\\nfatal, but additional factors might have contributed to\\nthe failure of seemingly appropriate therapy in this\\ncase. These factors include antimicrobial resistance,\\nwhich is unlikely in this patient because he had been\\ntreated continuously with first-line drugs for anaer-\\nobic bacteria; coinfection with a second, unidentified\\norganism; bacterial or fungal superinfection, which\\nis unlikely to have occurred so soon after admission;\\nand a persistent nidus of infection in a heart valve or\\nviscus. Findings that suggest the presence of infec-\\ntive endocarditis include conjunctival hemorrhage,\\nscattered purpuric lesions that could have been of\\nembolic origin, microscopical hematuria, and prom-\\ninent back pain as an initial symptom. These features\\nare all nonspecific manifestations of illness, however,\\nand no cardiac murmur was heard. Several of the or-\\nganisms I have discussed can cause abscesses. The\\nprominent abnormalities of liver function in this pa-\\ntient suggest the presence of a hepatic or perihepatic\\nabscess, or he might have had maxillary sinusitis or\\na periapical abscess, although all these disorders are\\nunlikely.\\nThis patient probably had septic shock due to\\nC. canimorsus or C. cynodegmi infection. These or-\\nganisms are susceptible to most antibiotics, and pen-\\nicillin is considered the drug of choice, although I\\nwould have continued a first-line antianaerobe drug\\n(such as metronidazole) along with a B-lactam anti-\\nbiotic until the diagnosis had been established. A\\nless likely diagnosis is sepsis due to infection with an\\noral human anaerobe, such as fusobacterium or cap-\\nnocytophaga species, or a fusobacterium species of\\nanimal origin.\\nSeveral diagnostic procedures might shed light on\\nthe nature of this patient\\'s primary infection and its\\npossible complications. Echocardiography performed\\nby either a transthoracic or a transesophageal ap-\\nproach might identify valvular vegetations or dysfunc-\\ntion; the transesophageal approach is more sensitive\\nbut also more hazardous. An abdominal computed\\ntomographic (CT) scan would yield information\\nabout the liver and kidneys, including the presence\\nor absence of a hepatic abscess. A CT scan of the si-\\nnuses and a dental radiograph might reveal opacifi-\\ncation of the sinus or an abscess, drainage of which\\nmight hasten recovery. I suspect that the diagnostic\\nprocedure performed in this case was either echo-\\ncardiography or a CT study of the abdomen. Unless\\nthe laboratory could assure me that identification\\nof the blood isolate was immediately forthcoming,\\nI would plan on performing both these procedures,\\ngiven the refractory and severe nature of this\\nman\\'s illness.\\nDR. ALPHONSE BALUTA: I cared for this patient\\nat the referring hospital. At presentation, he had\\nonly a shaking rigor, which lasted for three hours;\\nthe results of the examination and all the blood\\nchemical tests, including liver-function tests, were\\nnormal. Concerned that he might be in the initial\\nphase of an overwhelming sepsis, I gave him an-\\ntibiotics intravenously as a treatment for possible\\ninfection with encapsulated organisms. By the next\\nmorning, he was much sicker. When I learned that\\nthere were gram-negative rods in his blood culture,\\nI administered the other antibiotics and obtained a\\nlimited CT scan of the abdomen to rule out an in-\\ndolent intraabdominal process, but the scan showed\\nnormal findings. I also considered an odontogenic\\ninfection, but another physical examination revealed\\nno signs of such an infection. After aggressive ad-\\nministration of fluids and vasopressor support, it\\nbecame apparent that the patient would also need\\ndialysis, and I arranged for his transfer to this\\nhospital.\\nDR. WILLIAM R. RODRIGUEZ: By the time of his\\nadmission to this hospital, the patient\\'s condition\\nhad begun to improve. The blood culture was sent\\nto our microbiology laboratory for further evalua-\\ntion. The patient\\'s condition continued to improve\\nwith supportive care, dialysis, and antibiotics to cov-\\ner the organisms. By the time the specific diagnosis\\nwas made, he was still being treated with antibiotics\\nand dialysis and was nearly ready for discharge.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\nAsplenia.\\nSepsis, probably due to Capnocytophaga canimor-\\nsus infection.\\n\\nDR. JEFFREY PARSONNET\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nSeptic shock due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus or\\nC. cynodegmi infection.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. JAMES VERSALOVIC: Blood specimens ob-\\ntained for culture at this hospital were negative after\\nprolonged incubation. Sputum and stool cultures\\nwere also negative, and examination of the stool\\nshowed no ova or parasites. The blood culture from\\nthe referring hospital yielded thin, curved gram-\\nnegative rods with tapered ends after 48 hours of in-\\ncubation at this hospital. The organisms were plated\\non brucella agar with 5 percent horse\\'s blood and\\nwere incubated both in 5 percent carbon dioxide\\nand under strictly anaerobic conditions. After 11\\ndays of culture in 5 percent carbon dioxide, pinpoint\\ncolonies were observed. Gram\\'s staining showed ple-\\nomorphic, thin gram-negative rods with slightly ta-\\npered ends (Fig. 1), which are characteristic features\\nof capnocytophaga species. Although they were not\\nnoted in this case, capnocytophaga species may also\\nbe observed within neutrophils in buffy-coat and\\nWright-stained peripheral-blood smears.\\nVarious capnocytophaga species colonize the hu-\\nman oral cavity, including C. gingivalis, C. ochra-\\nceus, and C. sputigena of the DF-1 group of bacilli;\\nspecies that colonize the canine oral cavity include\\nC. canimorsus of the DF-2 group and the DF-2-like\\nspecies, such as C. cynodegmi.12 P. multocida has\\nbeen isolated from 50 to 66 percent of canine oral\\ncavities and has been commonly isolated from fe-\\nline oral cavities, but in this case, P. multocida infec-\\ntion was ruled out by the morphologic findings on\\nGram\\'s staining. In addition, one must include in\\nthe microbiologic differential diagnosis F. nuclea-\\ntum, an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus, which on\\nGram\\'s staining has morphologic features similar to\\nthose of capnocytophaga but is longer and more\\npleomorphic. Also, fusobacterium species are strict\\nanaerobes and typically form colonies within four\\ndays of anaerobic culture. The organisms in this\\ncase were capnophilic facultative anaerobes, since\\ngrowth was enhanced by the addition of carbon di-\\noxide.\\nAfter we isolated the organism by culture, we per-\\nformed various biochemical tests. The organism was\\npositive for catalase, distinguishing it from DF-1\\nspecies, which are typically negative for catalase.\\nCapnocytophaga species of the DF-2 group, includ-\\ning C. canimorsus, are positive for catalase and oxi-\\ndase.12 We did not detect oxidase activity, but the\\noxidase activity of capnocytophaga species may be\\nweak. The organisms used glucose, maltose, and lac-\\ntose for fermentation without gas production but\\ndid not use sucrose, xylose, raffinose, or D-mannitol,\\nfindings that are characteristic of C. canimorsus and\\nother DF-2 organisms.\\nOne key difference between C. cynodegmi and\\nC. canimorsus isolates is that 70 percent of the\\nformer ferment raffinose, and most of the latter do\\nnot. The isolate from this case did not ferment raf-\\nfinose.\\nWe ruled out a primary odontogenic source of\\nsepsis on the basis of a Panorex radiographic study\\nthat showed no evidence of an oral abscess, and the\\nCT scan showed no evidence of a hepatic abscess.\\nThe marked creatine kinase elevation could have\\nbeen due to rhabdomyolysis. The electrocardio-\\ngraphic findings, however, did not support a diag-\\nnosis of myocardial infarction, and transthoracic\\nechocardiography yielded no evidence of endocar-\\nditis.\\nAntimicrobial-susceptibility testing, which was\\nnot performed in this case, may provide useful infor-\\nmation in some cases. Penicillin G has been reported\\nto be the drug of choice in the literature, although\\nthis patient received a combination of ampicillin and\\nsulbactam, which is effective against most ẞ-lacta-\\nmases. In a Canadian study, 6 of 19 capnocytophaga\\nisolates (32 percent) had ẞ-lactamase activity. 30 The\\nclinical relevance of B-lactamases in C. canimorsus in-\\nfection remains arguable. Most C. canimorsus (DF-2)\\nisolates are susceptible to penicillin, cephalosporins,\\nclindamycin, and quinolones, as demonstrated in sev-\\neral studies by a variety of methods, including disk\\ndiffusion, antimicrobial gradient-strip testing, and agar\\ndilution. Most C. canimorsus isolates appear to be re-\\nsistant in vitro to aminoglycosides and metronidazole.\\nNo guidelines for testing the antimicrobial suscepti-\\nbility of these organisms have been issued by the Na-\\ntional Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards.\\nPers et al.14 reviewed 39 cases of C. canimorsus in-\\nfection in Denmark. Twenty-two cases were associ-\\nated with canine bites, and four cases with canine\\nlicking of existing lesions. Many of the patients pre-\\nsented with fever and gastrointestinal symptoms\\nsuch as vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.\\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation developed in\\n14 of the 39 patients, and 12 patients had fatal ful-\\nminant septicemia. The case fatality rate was 25 to\\n30 percent.14 All strains were isolated after two to\\neight days of primary incubation in various blood-\\nculture systems.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Have there been reports\\nof recurrent episodes of this infection? What would\\nbe your recommendations for the patient\\'s future\\nlifestyle?\\nDR. PARSONNET: I did not find any reports of re-\\ncurrent infection in the literature. I would advise the\\npatient to be more careful about his dogs\\' oral se-\\ncretions. Most of the antibiotics that we use for\\npatients who have been bitten by a dog or a cat are\\neffective. These infections are probably far more\\ncommon than we realize.\\nDR. BALUTA: The patient is once again able to\\noperate heavy machinery and is back at work. He has\\nfully recovered from the peripheral near-gangrene of\\nhis lower extremities; there is no residual peripheral\\nneuropathy. When he first resumed his job, the blis-\\nters recurred. I found, on questioning him, that he\\nhad been wearing the same work boots for years. At\\nmy suggestion, he replaced them, and the blisters re-\\nmitted. In retrospect, the illness probably began\\nwith a contact dermatitis related to his boots. He no\\nlonger has such close contact with his dogs. He has\\nreceived the 24-valent pneumococcal, H. influenzae,\\nand meningococcal vaccines, with positive antibody\\nresponses to all except three of the pneumococcal\\nserotypes tested.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

ELLENDER, Assistant Editors\\n\\nCase 17-1999\\n\\nPRESENTATION OF CASE\\nA 42-year-old asplenic man was admitted to the\\nhospital because of gram-negative sepsis.\\nThe patient had been well until one week earlier,\\nwhen his left upper teeth began to ache. Four days\\nbefore admission, he had abdominal cramps and two\\nloose stools. The next morning, he awakened with\\ndiffuse aches, especially in the arms, legs, and lower\\nback. After a small breakfast, he vomited several\\ntimes and then had shaking chills with increasing fe-\\nver. He was admitted to another hospital. His tem-\\nperature was 40°C. The results of a physical exami-\\nnation were otherwise normal. The urine was normal.\\nLaboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2).\\nThoracic and abdominal radiographs showed normal\\nfindings. A blood specimen was cultured. Ceftriax-\\none and ampicillin and ampicillin-sulbactam were\\ngiven intravenously.\\nOn the second hospital day, the patient vomited\\n500 ml of blood and had intense pains in his feet\\nand fingers. Examination revealed hypotension, with\\npetechiae and purpura on the hands, feet, face, and\\nchest. The urinary volume declined to 10 ml per\\nhour. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and\\n2). Radiographs of the chest showed normal find-\\nings. Fresh-frozen plasma and platelets were trans-\\nfused. Single doses of gentamicin, clindamycin, and\\nvancomycin were given intravenously, and a drip in-\\nfusion of dobutamine was started.\\nOn the next day, the patient was hemodynamical-\\nly stable and well oxygenated, and the dobutamine\\nwas discontinued. Oliguria persisted. Laboratory tests\\nwere performed (Tables 1 and 2). The blood culture\\nyielded anaerobic gram-negative rods. A single dose\\nof cefotaxime was administered. On the following\\nday, the patient was transferred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was a heavy-equipment operator. He\\nhad had a partial gastrectomy and a splenectomy af-\\nter receiving multiple stab wounds 19 years before\\nadmission. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes\\ndaily for many years; he had discontinued his cus-\\ntomary heavy alcohol intake five months before ad-\\nmission. He had last received an injection of pneu-\\nmococcal vaccine 16 years before admission, and he\\nhad not seen a physician since then. There was a his-\\ntory of periodontal disease with toothaches but no\\nrecent dental care. He had frequent foot blisters that\\nhe drained with a nonsterile pin, after which his two\\ndogs licked his feet; this had occurred as recently as\\ntwo days before his illness. Other household pets were\\ntwo cats, a cockatiel, a chinchilla, and a rabbit.\\nThe temperature was 36.6°C, the pulse was 82,\\nand the respirations were 22. The blood pressure\\nwas 120/70 mm Hg.\\nExamination showed purpuric lesions, several of\\nwhich were palpable, on the face, arms, and legs and\\na right conjunctival hemorrhage. No petechiae, sub-\\nungual splinter hemorrhages, or enlarged lymph\\nnodes were found. There was periodontal disease,\\nwithout local tenderness. The lungs were clear ex-\\ncept for bibasilar crackles. The muscles were diffuse-\\nly tender. A stool specimen was positive for occult\\nblood. The results of a neurologic examination were\\nnormal.\\nThe urine was amber and cloudy and was positive\\nfor protein (++) and bile (+); the sediment con-\\ntained 20 to 50 red cells; 3 to 5 white cells, includ-\\ning eosinophils; and a few bacteria per high-power\\nfield. The results of other laboratory tests are shown\\nin Tables 1 and 2. An electrocardiogram showed a nor-\\nmal rhythm at a rate of 90 and a pattern of left ven-\\ntricular hypertrophy. A thoracic radiograph showed\\nbibasilar patchy and linear opacities that were consis-\\ntent with the presence of pulmonary edema, pneu-\\nmonia, or atelectasis. Abdominal radiographs showed\\nnormal findings.\\nSpecimens of blood, sputum, urine, and stool were\\nobtained for culture. Cefotaxime and metronidazole\\nwere given intravenously. The temperature rose to\\n37.4°C.\\nOn the second hospital day, the axillary tempera-\\nture rose to 38.2°C, and icterus was noted. The urine\\nwas orange and was positive for protein (+++) and\\nbile (+). The sediment contained 20 to 50 red cells,\\n3 to 5 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power\\nfield and 3 to 5 granular casts per low-power field.\\nThe results of other laboratory tests are shown in Ta-\\nbles 1 and 2. Transfusions of packed red cells and\\nplatelets were given.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. JEFFREY PARSONNET*: I shall begin my dis-\\ncussion by examining host factors that may have pre-\\ndisposed this man to overwhelming infection. His\\nmost obvious immunodeficiency is asplenism. Sple-\\nnectomy decreases the capacity of the reticuloen-\\ndothelial cells to clear microorganisms from the\\nblood, thereby predisposing patients to rapidly fatal\\ninfections. Asplenic patients are highly susceptible to\\ninfection with encapsulated bacteria, such as Strep-\\ntococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and\\nNeisseria meningitidis, because of deficient produc-\\ntion of antibodies to T-cell-independent antigens,\\nsuch as the polysaccharide components of bacterial\\ncapsules. Such patients are also prone to severe in-\\nfection with Capnocytophaga canimorsus, some gram-\\nnegative enteric organisms, and the babesia species\\nof protozoa. Another host factor in this patient is his\\nhistory of heavy alcohol use. He received no medical\\ncare for many years, so he may have had alcoholic\\nliver disease, although there was no physical evidence\\nof it. Liver disease would have further impaired his\\nreticuloendothelial system, and ongoing, heavy con-\\nsumption of alcohol could have decreased his resist-\\nance to bacterial infection by causing granulocyte\\ndysfunction.¹ In addition, periodontal disease predis-\\nposed him to various infectious complications, in\\nwhich anaerobic bacteria figure prominently. Finally,\\nhe had self-induced impairment of the most impor-\\ntant defense against infection, intact skin, which may\\nhave been breached during its lavage with canine oral\\nsecretions.\\nSeveral epidemiologic factors may be important in\\nthis case, including exposure to various common and\\nexotic pets. A zoonosis must be seriously considered,\\nwith percutaneous inoculation the most likely mode\\nof transmission of infectious agents. The most inti-\\nmate exposure was to the saliva of dogs, which con-\\ntains various aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, most no-\\ntably Pasteurella multocida, but also bacteroides and\\nfusobacterium species.2 The patient\\'s other animals\\ncould have transmitted many pathogenic bacteria, in-\\ncluding P. multocida, species of campylobacter and\\nsalmonella, and the agents of tularemia, plague, and\\nrat-bite fever. Also transmissible are several species of\\ncapnocytophaga that inhabit the oral cavity in dogs,\\ncats, and rabbits and can cause serious infections,\\nparticularly in immunocompromised hosts. None of\\nthese organisms are true anaerobes, although campy-\\nlobacters are microaerophilic, and capnocytophaga\\nspecies are classified as facultative anaerobes.\\nThe patient\\'s history of smoking and his con-\\nstruction work would be important factors if he had\\na primary pulmonary source of infection, but his\\npulmonary infiltrates were probably due to septic\\nshock.\\nWhat aspects of this patient\\'s clinical presentation\\nsuggest a primary source of bacteremia? Most of the\\nsymptoms and signs are nonspecific, common man-\\nifestations of the systemic inflammatory response syn-\\ndrome, which includes the sepsis syndrome.3 Among\\nthese manifestations were vomiting and diarrhea, my-\\nalgias, fever, rigors, and jaundice. Myalgias and back\\npain are especially frequent in cases of infective en-\\ndocarditis, rickettsial infection, and, in my experience,\\nstaphylococcal bacteremia. Jaundice is a common\\nfeature of sepsis; it is caused by diverse mechanisms,\\nincluding an inability to excrete conjugated biliru-\\nbin.4 A more specific manifestation of this patient\\'s\\nillness may be the aching in his teeth, which could\\nhave been an early symptom of a dentoalveolar in-\\nfection, periodontal infection, maxillary sinusitis, or a\\ncombination of these disorders. Anaerobic bacteria,\\nespecially fusobacterium and pigmented bacteroides\\nspecies (including porphyromonas and prevotella,\\nwhich have recently been classified as genera), are\\nprimary pathogens in odontogenic infections. Several\\nspecies of capnocytophaga may also be involved in\\nperiodontal infection and may cause sepsis in immu-\\nnocompromised hosts and focal or disseminated\\ninfections in normal hosts. In this case, however, sev-\\neral physical examinations revealed only chronic per-\\niodontal disease, and the patient had a long history\\nof toothaches. I suspect that they were unrelated to\\nhis sepsis.\\nTherefore, the primary source of infection in this\\npatient could have been percutaneous inoculation of\\nskin flora, oral flora, or even gastrointestinal tract\\nflora. The vomiting and diarrhea were probably non-\\nspecific manifestations of sepsis, but we must re-\\nmember that intraabdominal infection is the most\\ncommon cause of bacteremia due to gram-negative\\nanaerobic bacilli.\\nUnder these circumstances, a complementary di-\\nagnostic approach is to consider the gram-negative\\nanaerobic bacilli that can cause sepsis and then merge\\nthose results with the clinical findings. Bacteroides\\nspecies are important constituents of normal human\\nflora, and Bacteroides fragilis is the most commonly\\ndocumented cause of anaerobic bacteremia. Bacteroi-\\ndes and prevotella species achieve high concentra-\\ntions in tonsillar crypts, gingival crevices, and the\\ncolon. The special importance of B. fragilis as a\\npathogen has been attributed to the role of its dis-\\ntinct polysaccharide capsule, which promotes ab-\\ncess formation.5 The finding of B. fragilis in the\\nblood suggests an intraabdominal infection, which\\nis most likely to be polymicrobial. Bacteroides bac-\\nteremia itself does not usually result in sepsis be-\\ncause of the relatively low virulence of its endotoxin,\\nbut other organisms involved in polymicrobial infec-\\ntions, particularly gram-negative aerobes, can cause\\nsepsis.\\nDespite the predominance of bacteroides as an an-\\naerobic blood isolate, this patient\\'s illness was not\\nsuggestive of an intraabdominal infection. However,\\nI would have continued treatment with an antibiotic\\n(such as metronidazole) that is effective against most\\nstrains of B. fragilis until the culture results became\\navailable.\\nPorphyromonas gingivalis is a common periodontal\\npathogen in humans, and several species of porphy-\\nromonas are frequently found in properly cultured\\nwounds from cat or dog bites. However, this organ-\\nism is unlikely to cause an infection as severe as that\\nin this patient. Similarly, assorted prevotella species\\ncause infections of the oral cavity, sinuses, lower res-\\npiratory tract, and female genital tract, but isolation\\nof these organisms from the bloodstream is unusual,\\nand overwhelming sepsis would be an uncharacter-\\nistic manifestation of such an infection.\\nMore deserving of consideration are Fusobacteri-\\num nucleatum and F. necrophorum, which are also\\ncommon constituents of oral flora but are more like-\\nly to cause serious infections than P. gingivalis is.\\nF. necrophorum is the cause of Lemierre\\'s syndrome,\\nor postanginal sepsis, which is associated with bac-\\nteremia and septic jugular-vein thrombophlebitis.7\\nOdontogenic infection with F. nucleatum can also\\ncause severe illness. Both species can be isolated from\\ncultures in patients with anaerobic lung infections,\\nand these organisms can cause endocarditis and fatal\\nsepsis. In the light of this patient\\'s toothache and\\nperiodontal disease, infection with fusobacterium\\ncannot be discounted, although the paucity of find-\\nings in the head and neck makes it an unlikely di-\\nagnosis.\\nThe possibility of infection with a bacterium of\\nthe genus campylobacter merits consideration, be-\\ncause infections with such organisms as a result of\\nexposure to animals often cause diarrheal and sys-\\ntemic illnesses. Campylobacter organisms are com-\\nmon commensals in the gastrointestinal tracts of cats\\nand dogs. Some strains cause enteric infections,\\nwhich may be severe. Bacteremia, endocarditis, and\\nother serious complications may ensue, but septic\\nshock is uncharacteristic of the strains that cause en-\\nteric illness. Campylobacter fetus is more likely to cause\\nbacteremia and secondary infection of organs, which\\nmay be fatal, particularly in persons with impaired\\ncell-mediated immunity. However, the patient under\\ndiscussion had no predisposition to this infection.\\nFurthermore, campylobacter organisms are micro-\\naerophilic and are unlikely to be classified as anaer-\\nobes in a report from a microbiology laboratory.\\nThe possibility of C. fetus infection cannot be ruled\\nout in this patient, but it would be an unusually se-\\nvere case, even if the liver disease were worse than\\nthe physical examinations suggested.\\nC. canimorsus causes the type of infection this pa-\\ntient had and is associated with the host factors and\\ncircumstances described in this case. Capnocytopha-\\nga species are long, thin, gram-negative rods that are\\nfacultative anaerobes, but they grow best in an at-\\nmosphere enriched with carbon dioxide, from which\\nthe name of the genus is derived; it means \"eater of\\ncarbon dioxide.\" Several strains colonize the subgin-\\ngival sulcus in healthy adults. These strains can cause\\nsepsis in immunocompromised patients, particularly\\nthose with granulocytopenia or an underlying hema-\\ntologic tumor that is malignant.10 Sepsis is less likely\\nto develop in immunocompetent patients, but they\\nmay have disseminated infection, including endocar-\\nditis. Overwhelming sepsis, however, has not been\\nreported in association with splenectomy or alcoholic\\ncirrhosis.\\nIn contrast, C. canimorsus (Latin for \"dog bite\"),\\nwhich is part of the normal oral flora of dogs, cats,\\nand other animals, is known to cause septic shock in\\nimmunocompromised patients. This organism, for-\\nmerly known as group DF-2, was first identified as a\\ncause of sepsis in 1976.11 A second strain, C. супо-\\ndegmi (Greek for \"dog bite\"), has also been isolated\\nfrom patients with infections that followed dog\\nbites. These organisms have been the subject of nu-\\nmerous reviews12-15 and case reports.16-29 Infections\\nwith C. canimorsus occur predominantly in adults,\\nmore often in men (72 percent of cases) than in\\nwomen, and most patients have been either bitten\\nby or otherwise exposed to dogs. In many cases, the\\nexposure has been trivial. C. canimorsus sepsis has\\nbeen associated with asplenia (in 38 percent of cas-\\nes) and a history of alcohol abuse (in 30 percent),\\nalthough cases have been reported in which there\\nwas no apparent predisposing factor.\\nC. canimorsus infection causes mild-to-fulminant\\ndisease. The rate of mortality from bacteremia is ap-\\nproximately 30 percent. In both normal and asplenic\\npersons, shock, renal failure, the acute respiratory\\ndistress syndrome, and peripheral gangrene are com-\\nmon complications of bacteremia, and disseminated\\nintravascular coagulation occurs in more than one\\nthird of infected patients.13,14,16,17,19,22,26-28 Numerous\\ninvestigators have reported syndromes of purpura\\nfulminans; endocarditis has also been reported. The\\npathogenesis of capnocytophaga infections remains\\npoorly understood.\\nThis patient\\'s exposure to animals, compromised\\nimmunity, and illness are highly characteristic of in-\\nfection with C. canimorsus (or C. cynodegmi). This\\ndiagnosis would not explain the patient\\'s report of\\ntoothache, and it disregards the initial report of an-\\naerobes in the blood culture. C. canimorsus and\\nC. cynodegmi are frequently identified initially as\\nanaerobes.\\nDespite treatment for 72 hours with numerous\\nantibiotics, several of which should have been suf-\\nficient to treat the organisms I have discussed, this\\npatient remained severely ill. Infection of immuno-\\ncompromised hosts with C. canimorsus can itself be\\nfatal, but additional factors might have contributed to\\nthe failure of seemingly appropriate therapy in this\\ncase. These factors include antimicrobial resistance,\\nwhich is unlikely in this patient because he had been\\ntreated continuously with first-line drugs for anaer-\\nobic bacteria; coinfection with a second, unidentified\\norganism; bacterial or fungal superinfection, which\\nis unlikely to have occurred so soon after admission;\\nand a persistent nidus of infection in a heart valve or\\nviscus. Findings that suggest the presence of infec-\\ntive endocarditis include conjunctival hemorrhage,\\nscattered purpuric lesions that could have been of\\nembolic origin, microscopical hematuria, and prom-\\ninent back pain as an initial symptom. These features\\nare all nonspecific manifestations of illness, however,\\nand no cardiac murmur was heard. Several of the or-\\nganisms I have discussed can cause abscesses. The\\nprominent abnormalities of liver function in this pa-\\ntient suggest the presence of a hepatic or perihepatic\\nabscess, or he might have had maxillary sinusitis or\\na periapical abscess, although all these disorders are\\nunlikely.\\nThis patient probably had septic shock due to\\nC. canimorsus or C. cynodegmi infection. These or-\\nganisms are susceptible to most antibiotics, and pen-\\nicillin is considered the drug of choice, although I\\nwould have continued a first-line antianaerobe drug\\n(such as metronidazole) along with a B-lactam anti-\\nbiotic until the diagnosis had been established. A\\nless likely diagnosis is sepsis due to infection with an\\noral human anaerobe, such as fusobacterium or cap-\\nnocytophaga species, or a fusobacterium species of\\nanimal origin.\\nSeveral diagnostic procedures might shed light on\\nthe nature of this patient\\'s primary infection and its\\npossible complications. Echocardiography performed\\nby either a transthoracic or a transesophageal ap-\\nproach might identify valvular vegetations or dysfunc-\\ntion; the transesophageal approach is more sensitive\\nbut also more hazardous. An abdominal computed\\ntomographic (CT) scan would yield information\\nabout the liver and kidneys, including the presence\\nor absence of a hepatic abscess. A CT scan of the si-\\nnuses and a dental radiograph might reveal opacifi-\\ncation of the sinus or an abscess, drainage of which\\nmight hasten recovery. I suspect that the diagnostic\\nprocedure performed in this case was either echo-\\ncardiography or a CT study of the abdomen. Unless\\nthe laboratory could assure me that identification\\nof the blood isolate was immediately forthcoming,\\nI would plan on performing both these procedures,\\ngiven the refractory and severe nature of this\\nman\\'s illness.\\nDR. ALPHONSE BALUTA: I cared for this patient\\nat the referring hospital. At presentation, he had\\nonly a shaking rigor, which lasted for three hours;\\nthe results of the examination and all the blood\\nchemical tests, including liver-function tests, were\\nnormal. Concerned that he might be in the initial\\nphase of an overwhelming sepsis, I gave him an-\\ntibiotics intravenously as a treatment for possible\\ninfection with encapsulated organisms. By the next\\nmorning, he was much sicker. When I learned that\\nthere were gram-negative rods in his blood culture,\\nI administered the other antibiotics and obtained a\\nlimited CT scan of the abdomen to rule out an in-\\ndolent intraabdominal process, but the scan showed\\nnormal findings. I also considered an odontogenic\\ninfection, but another physical examination revealed\\nno signs of such an infection. After aggressive ad-\\nministration of fluids and vasopressor support, it\\nbecame apparent that the patient would also need\\ndialysis, and I arranged for his transfer to this\\nhospital.\\nDR. WILLIAM R. RODRIGUEZ: By the time of his\\nadmission to this hospital, the patient\\'s condition\\nhad begun to improve. The blood culture was sent\\nto our microbiology laboratory for further evalua-\\ntion. The patient\\'s condition continued to improve\\nwith supportive care, dialysis, and antibiotics to cov-\\ner the organisms. By the time the specific diagnosis\\nwas made, he was still being treated with antibiotics\\nand dialysis and was nearly ready for discharge.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\nAsplenia.\\nSepsis, probably due to Capnocytophaga canimor-\\nsus infection.\\n\\nDR. JEFFREY PARSONNET\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nSeptic shock due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus or\\nC. cynodegmi infection.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. JAMES VERSALOVIC: Blood specimens ob-\\ntained for culture at this hospital were negative after\\nprolonged incubation. Sputum and stool cultures\\nwere also negative, and examination of the stool\\nshowed no ova or parasites. The blood culture from\\nthe referring hospital yielded thin, curved gram-\\nnegative rods with tapered ends after 48 hours of in-\\ncubation at this hospital. The organisms were plated\\non brucella agar with 5 percent horse\\'s blood and\\nwere incubated both in 5 percent carbon dioxide\\nand under strictly anaerobic conditions. After 11\\ndays of culture in 5 percent carbon dioxide, pinpoint\\ncolonies were observed. Gram\\'s staining showed ple-\\nomorphic, thin gram-negative rods with slightly ta-\\npered ends (Fig. 1), which are characteristic features\\nof capnocytophaga species. Although they were not\\nnoted in this case, capnocytophaga species may also\\nbe observed within neutrophils in buffy-coat and\\nWright-stained peripheral-blood smears.\\nVarious capnocytophaga species colonize the hu-\\nman oral cavity, including C. gingivalis, C. ochra-\\nceus, and C. sputigena of the DF-1 group of bacilli;\\nspecies that colonize the canine oral cavity include\\nC. canimorsus of the DF-2 group and the DF-2-like\\nspecies, such as C. cynodegmi.12 P. multocida has\\nbeen isolated from 50 to 66 percent of canine oral\\ncavities and has been commonly isolated from fe-\\nline oral cavities, but in this case, P. multocida infec-\\ntion was ruled out by the morphologic findings on\\nGram\\'s staining. In addition, one must include in\\nthe microbiologic differential diagnosis F. nuclea-\\ntum, an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus, which on\\nGram\\'s staining has morphologic features similar to\\nthose of capnocytophaga but is longer and more\\npleomorphic. Also, fusobacterium species are strict\\nanaerobes and typically form colonies within four\\ndays of anaerobic culture. The organisms in this\\ncase were capnophilic facultative anaerobes, since\\ngrowth was enhanced by the addition of carbon di-\\noxide.\\nAfter we isolated the organism by culture, we per-\\nformed various biochemical tests. The organism was\\npositive for catalase, distinguishing it from DF-1\\nspecies, which are typically negative for catalase.\\nCapnocytophaga species of the DF-2 group, includ-\\ning C. canimorsus, are positive for catalase and oxi-\\ndase.12 We did not detect oxidase activity, but the\\noxidase activity of capnocytophaga species may be\\nweak. The organisms used glucose, maltose, and lac-\\ntose for fermentation without gas production but\\ndid not use sucrose, xylose, raffinose, or D-mannitol,\\nfindings that are characteristic of C. canimorsus and\\nother DF-2 organisms.\\nOne key difference between C. cynodegmi and\\nC. canimorsus isolates is that 70 percent of the\\nformer ferment raffinose, and most of the latter do\\nnot. The isolate from this case did not ferment raf-\\nfinose.\\nWe ruled out a primary odontogenic source of\\nsepsis on the basis of a Panorex radiographic study\\nthat showed no evidence of an oral abscess, and the\\nCT scan showed no evidence of a hepatic abscess.\\nThe marked creatine kinase elevation could have\\nbeen due to rhabdomyolysis. The electrocardio-\\ngraphic findings, however, did not support a diag-\\nnosis of myocardial infarction, and transthoracic\\nechocardiography yielded no evidence of endocar-\\nditis.\\nAntimicrobial-susceptibility testing, which was\\nnot performed in this case, may provide useful infor-\\nmation in some cases. Penicillin G has been reported\\nto be the drug of choice in the literature, although\\nthis patient received a combination of ampicillin and\\nsulbactam, which is effective against most ẞ-lacta-\\nmases. In a Canadian study, 6 of 19 capnocytophaga\\nisolates (32 percent) had ẞ-lactamase activity. 30 The\\nclinical relevance of B-lactamases in C. canimorsus in-\\nfection remains arguable. Most C. canimorsus (DF-2)\\nisolates are susceptible to penicillin, cephalosporins,\\nclindamycin, and quinolones, as demonstrated in sev-\\neral studies by a variety of methods, including disk\\ndiffusion, antimicrobial gradient-strip testing, and agar\\ndilution. Most C. canimorsus isolates appear to be re-\\nsistant in vitro to aminoglycosides and metronidazole.\\nNo guidelines for testing the antimicrobial suscepti-\\nbility of these organisms have been issued by the Na-\\ntional Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards.\\nPers et al.14 reviewed 39 cases of C. canimorsus in-\\nfection in Denmark. Twenty-two cases were associ-\\nated with canine bites, and four cases with canine\\nlicking of existing lesions. Many of the patients pre-\\nsented with fever and gastrointestinal symptoms\\nsuch as vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.\\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation developed in\\n14 of the 39 patients, and 12 patients had fatal ful-\\nminant septicemia. The case fatality rate was 25 to\\n30 percent.14 All strains were isolated after two to\\neight days of primary incubation in various blood-\\nculture systems.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Have there been reports\\nof recurrent episodes of this infection? What would\\nbe your recommendations for the patient\\'s future\\nlifestyle?\\nDR. PARSONNET: I did not find any reports of re-\\ncurrent infection in the literature. I would advise the\\npatient to be more careful about his dogs\\' oral se-\\ncretions. Most of the antibiotics that we use for\\npatients who have been bitten by a dog or a cat are\\neffective. These infections are probably far more\\ncommon than we realize.\\nDR. BALUTA: The patient is once again able to\\noperate heavy machinery and is back at work. He has\\nfully recovered from the peripheral near-gangrene of\\nhis lower extremities; there is no residual peripheral\\nneuropathy. When he first resumed his job, the blis-\\nters recurred. I found, on questioning him, that he\\nhad been wearing the same work boots for years. At\\nmy suggestion, he replaced them, and the blisters re-\\nmitted. In retrospect, the illness probably began\\nwith a contact dermatitis related to his boots. He no\\nlonger has such close contact with his dogs. He has\\nreceived the 24-valent pneumococcal, H. influenzae,\\nand meningococcal vaccines, with positive antibody\\nresponses to all except three of the pneumococcal\\nserotypes tested.', 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"WORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Septic shock due to Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection.\\nDISEASE_NAME: Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection\\n1. **Information Gathering:**\\n    *   **Key Signs/Symptoms:** Gram-negative sepsis, fever, chills, abdominal cramps, vomiting, shaking chills, hypotension, petechiae, purpura, oliguria, jaundice, back pain, toothache, foot blisters, contact with dogs.\\n    *   **Duration:** Symptoms started one week prior to admission, with a rapid progression to septic shock.\\n    *   **Epidemiologic Context:** Asplenic (due to splenectomy), history of heavy alcohol use, history of periodontal disease, frequent foot blisters from dog contact.\\n    *   **Comorbidities/Medications:** History of partial gastrectomy, heavy-equipment operator.\\n    *   **Red-Flag Features:** Hypotension, petechiae, purpura, jaundice, oliguria, and the rapid progression to septic shock.\\n\\n2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\\n    *   **Anatomical System:** Systemic (sepsis), Integumentary (petechiae, purpura, foot blisters), Gastrointestinal (abdominal cramps, vomiting), Renal (oliguria), Hepatic (jaundice).\\n    *   **Timing/Progression:** Rapid onset of symptoms, progression to septic shock.\\n    *   **Age/Risk Factors:** Asplenia, heavy alcohol use, periodontal disease, dog contact.\\n    *   **Differential Diagnosis:**\\n        *   **Infectious:**\\n            *   Capnocytophaga canimorsus (most likely given the history and clinical presentation)\\n            *   Neisseria meningitidis\\n            *   Streptococcus pneumoniae\\n            *   Salmonella species\\n            *   Yersinia enterocolitica\\n            *   E. coli\\n            *   Klebsiella pneumoniae\\n            *   Pseudomonas aeruginosa\\n            *   Anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, etc.)\\n            *   Rickettsial infections (e.g., Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever)\\n            *   Viral infections (e.g., Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya)\\n            *   Leptospirosis\\n            *   Typhoid fever\\n            *   Tuberculosis\\n            *   HIV (acute)\\n        *   **Non-Infectious:**\\n            *   Drug-induced sepsis\\n            *   Pancreatitis\\n            *   Acute kidney injury\\n            *   Vasculitis\\n\\n3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\\n    *   **Defining Features:**\\n        *   Asplenia\\n        *   Dog contact\\n        *   Rapid progression to septic shock\\n        *   Gram-negative rods in blood culture\\n        *   Presence of Capnocytophaga species\\n    *   **Discriminatory Features:**\\n        *   History of heavy alcohol use\\n        *   Periodontal disease\\n        *   Foot blisters from dog contact\\n        *   Jaundice\\n        *   Back pain\\n        *   Toothache\\n    *   **Point-of-Care Tests/Labs:**\\n        *   Blood cultures (repeat if initial cultures are negative)\\n        *   Complete blood count (CBC) with differential\\n        *   Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)\\n        *   Coagulation studies (PT, PTT, INR, fibrinogen)\\n        *   Blood gas analysis\\n        *   Urinalysis\\n        *   Serology for common tropical/infectious diseases (e.g., Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, Leptospirosis, Typhoid)\\n        *   PCR for common pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia)\\n        *   Consider imaging (CT scan of abdomen/pelvis, chest X-ray) if there is concern for intra-abdominal or pulmonary source.\\n    *   **Potential Diagnostic Biases:**\\n        *   **Anchoring Bias:** The initial suspicion of gram-negative sepsis might lead to overlooking other possibilities.\\n        *   **Availability Bias:** The clinician might be more likely to consider a diagnosis based on what is readily available in the local epidemiology.\\n        *   **Framing Bias:** The presentation of the case might be framed in a way that emphasizes the severity of the illness, leading to a more pessimistic outlook.\\n\\n4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:**\\n    *   The patient's asplenia, history of dog contact, and rapid progression to septic shock strongly suggest Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection.

A throat culture was negative. The rash improved after a 10-day course of amoxicillin. A diagnosis of roseola was made. A few days later, the skin on the arms and legs began to peel. Eleven days before admission, the patient’s temperature rose to 40°C, and she became irritable, ate poorly, and had a nonproductive cough, coryza, swollen lips, and lingual erythema. She was referred to this hospital.\\nThe girl had been born after a full-term pregnancy. Her immunizations were up to date. She had lost 0.45 kg in weight during the previous two weeks. There was no history of travel or exposure to tuberculosis, sick persons, or animals, and there was no family history of allergy.\\nThe temperature was 39.7°C, the pulse was 120, and the respirations were 46. The blood pressure was 115/65 mm Hg.\\nExamination revealed a diffuse erythematous rash with desquamation on the legs, toes, and fingers, with cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. The conjunctivae were erythematous, and there was nasal discharge. The lips were swollen, and the tongue and pharynx were reddened. The left tympanic membrane was white. The results of an ophthalmoscopic examination were normal. The lungs were clear, and the heart was normal.\\nThe urine was positive for protein (+) and for ketones (+); the sediment contained no red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power field. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). Radiographs of the chest (Fig. 1) revealed pneumonia in the right upper lobe with a small pleural effusion. While the patient was breathing ambient air, the oxygen saturation was 99 percent. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 193. The results of a cardiac ultrasonographic study were normal. A throat culture yielded group A, B-hemolytic streptococci; a swab from an inguinal lesion was negative for herpes simplex virus.\\nSpecimens of urine and blood were obtained for culture. Clarithromycin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and aspirin were given orally, and vancomycin was given intravenously. The temperature ranged from 38.6 to 40.8°C during the next five days. The rash began to clear after the first day.\\nOn the third hospital day, a tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative, 5 TU) was positive at 24 hours, a test for candida antigen was positive, and a test for mumps antigen was negative. All culture specimens remained negative. Repeated chest radiographs showed pneumonia of the right upper lobe with a larger pleural effusion. More extensive history taking revealed that the infant\\'s father had been exposed to tuberculosis many years earlier and might have received treatment with isoniazid.\\nOn the fourth hospital day, the rash continued to resolve. The tuberculin skin test remained positive, with 22 mm of induration at 48 hours. Laboratory tests were performed (Table 1). The findings on radiographs of the chest were unchanged. A right-sided thoracentesis yielded 2 ml of fluid for analysis (Table 3). While the infant was in the fasting state, three specimens of gastric contents were obtained on consecutive days for mycobacterial cultures; microscopical examination of the specimens showed no acid-fast bacilli.\\nOn the fifth hospital day, occasional wheezes were heard. Repeated chest radiographs showed right-upper-lobe pneumonia with a free-flowing pleural effusion. Ceftriaxone was administered intravenously. On the next day, influenza A viral antigen was detected in a specimen of nasal washings. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest (Fig. 2), obtained without intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed right-upper-lobe pneumonia with a moderate pleural effusion, but no lymphadenopathy. On the seventh hospital day, the temperature rose to 40.9°C.\\nOn the eighth hospital day, laboratory tests were performed (Table 1). All bacteriologic cultures remained negative.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. ROBERT N. HUSSON*: May we review the radiographic findings?\\nDR. ROBERT T. BRAMSON: The chest radiograph obtained on admission (Fig. 1) shows a dense consolidation in the right upper lobe and hilum, with a small pleural effusion. The thoracic CT scan (Fig. 2) shows similar findings.\\nDR. HUSSON: The remarkable features of this child\\'s illness are its biphasic course and the combination of persistent fever, cutaneous and mucosal abnormalities, a positive tuberculin test, a pulmonary infiltrate, and a pleural effusion. These findings meet the criteria for pulmonary tuberculosis and possibly those for Kawasaki\\'s syndrome (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome). Both diseases may be difficult to diagnose, because a positive culture is obtained in less than half the cases of pediatric tuberculosis, and there is no definitive diagnostic test for Kawasaki\\'s syndrome. I shall discuss this case in the context of these two disorders, as well as several others.\\nKawasaki\\'s syndrome is an idiopathic systemic vasculitis that primarily affects infants and young children. Originally described in Japanese children in the 1960s, it is now recognized to occur worldwide in children of all ethnic groups, although its prevalence remains highest in children of Asian ancestry. The epidemiology of the disease and the occurrence of seasonal epidemics suggest an infectious cause. The clinical features include fever; a polymorphous erythematous rash, often with perineal accentuation; bilateral conjunctival injection; lymphadenopathy, which is usually unilateral and cervical; oral changes such as oropharyngeal erythema, strawberry tongue, and red, cracked lips; and indurative edema of the fingers and toes and erythema of the palms or soles, with periungual desquamation of the fingers and toes during convalescence. The diagnostic criteria comprise fever of at least five days\\' duration and four of the other five findings. Some children, particularly those under one year of age, may have atypical, or incomplete, Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, with persistent fever but fewer than four of the other findings.\\nThe main complication of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome is the development of coronary-artery aneurysms, which occur in 20 to 25 percent of untreated patients, generally appear in the subacute stage of the illness, and may lead to sudden death. The risk of aneurysm formation is highest in young infants and may be correlated with the duration of the fever. The administration of a single high dose of intravenous immune globulin and long-term administration of aspirin markedly reduce the frequency of aneurysms.\\nTo what extent can Kawasaki\\'s syndrome account for this child\\'s illness? Her prolonged fever, rash, conjunctival injection, and oral changes clearly suggest the diagnosis. Other findings, however, are less consistent with it. The lymphadenopathy is diffuse rather than focal. The nature and location of the desquamation are atypical; in particular, the peeling after the first episode of fever involved the legs, toes, and fingers rather than a periungual distribution. Other aspects of this case that do not support this diagnosis include the absence of uveitis and the absence of coronary-artery aneurysms in a child at high risk — that is, a child under one year of age who had a fever for more than 10 days and did not receive immune globulin. Therefore, at most, a diagnosis of incomplete, or atypical, Kawasaki\\'s syndrome would be warranted in this case. Nevertheless, the duration of this child\\'s fever, the relatively high frequency of incomplete manifestations of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome in infants, the low toxicity of therapy, and the importance of preventing coronary-artery aneurysms would warrant the administration of immune globulin and aspirin in the absence of an alternative diagnosis.\\nIf this child had Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, what caused the positive tuberculin test and the pulmonary infiltrate? Soon after Kawasaki\\'s syndrome was first described, it was noted that erythema and edema developed at the site of prior vaccination with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) in some Japanese children with the disease. In a subsequent prospective study, this reaction occurred in approximately one third of the children. It was not associated with detectable mycobacterial replication, and it resolved during the convalescent stage of the disease. Inflammation at sites of recent tuberculin tests was also reported.\\nThese observations led Bertotto and colleagues to perform tuberculin testing in 11 children with well-documented Kawasaki\\'s syndrome and a control group of 50 children. All the children with Kawasaki\\'s syndrome had strongly positive reactions, but none of the controls did. The children with Kawasaki\\'s syndrome had negative tuberculin tests within one to two months. Peripheral-blood T cells from these children proliferated in response to purified protein derivative, in contrast to the results in the control group. Thus, tuberculin tests in patients with acute Kawasaki\\'s syndrome often have false positive results.\\nThis child\\'s lung disease, however, cannot be explained as a manifestation of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome. Pulmonary abnormalities, including infiltrates and effusions, have been reported in up to 15 percent of children with Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, but they are typically mild and transient. A dense pulmonary consolidation, as seen in this patient, has not been described.\\nWhat other diseases must one consider in the differential diagnosis of prolonged fever and rash in a child? In a series of children who were evaluated for Kawasaki\\'s syndrome but given an alternative diagnosis, 83 percent of the diagnoses were infections, including measles, group A streptococcal infection, Staphylococcus aureus infection, documented or presumed viral infections, and leptospirosis. Noninfectious disorders included drug reactions and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.\\nIn this patient, rheumatoid arthritis can be ruled out clinically. Although a reaction to amoxicillin could explain the fever and the cutaneous and mucosal changes, the lung disease is inconsistent with the diagnosis of a drug reaction, and there was no known exposure to the drug before the onset of fever. The biphasic course of the disease, the duration of fever in the second phase, the markedly elevated sedimentation rate, the desquamation, and the appearance of the lung infiltrate are evidence against the diagnosis of measles and other viral illnesses. The positive test for influenza A viral antigen is an interesting finding, but influenzavirus is unlikely to have caused this child\\'s illness. Although influenza followed by a bacterial pneumonia could account for prolonged fever and focal pulmonary consolidation, one would not expect to find influenza A virus 17 days after the onset of the febrile illness that it caused.\\nInfection caused by S. aureus or group A streptococcus is an important consideration in this child. Both organisms can produce toxins capable of causing many of the signs and symptoms in this patient, simulating Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, with a diffuse erythematous rash, subsequent desquamation, conjunctival injection, and oropharyngeal erythema. Strains of S. aureus that have been associated with this type of illness usually produce toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) and less frequently produce one or more of the other staphylococcal enterotoxins. Streptococcal strains associated with these findings produce exotoxin A or B.\\nIn infants, the term “staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome\" has been applied to both typical cases with a positive Nikolsky\\'s sign and cases that more closely resemble scarlet fever. Lina and colleagues recently reported a strong correlation between the type of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and the specific toxin expressed. Staphylococcal strains causing typical staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome or bullous impetigo were found to produce exfoliative toxin A or B, or both, whereas strains causing staphylococcal scarlet fever predominantly produced TSST-1 or an enterotoxin.\\nThe similarities between a disease associated with staphylococcal or streptococcal toxin and Kawasaki\\'s syndrome have led investigators to search for evidence of staphylococcal or streptococcal infection in children with Kawasaki\\'s syndrome. Coronary-artery aneurysms have been reported in a few children with staphylococcal infections. In a prospective study, Leung and colleagues identified colonization or infection with toxin-producing S. aureus or group A streptococcus in 13 of 16 patients with well-documented Kawasaki\\'s syndrome. Although others have not found a convincing association between infection with S. aureus or group A streptococcus and Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, the fact that these organisms can cause diseases that share many features of the syndrome suggests that they may have a role in its pathogenesis in some patients.\\nThis patient\\'s illness is consistent with the presence of a disease caused by a staphylococcal or streptococcal toxin. The skin peeling that is a feature of the convalescent phase of both Kawasaki\\'s syndrome and TSST-1-mediated disease occurs predominantly on the hands and feet; periungual desquamation is more characteristic of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome than of TSST-1-mediated disease. The skin tends to peel in sheets. The desquamation that follows streptococcal scarlet fever is usually more diffuse and is characterized by fine flaking of the skin.\\nWhat could have been the source of infection or colonization with S. aureus or group A streptococcus in this patient? Pharyngeal colonization with S. aureus would probably have been overlooked on the routine throat culture for group A streptococcus. The inguinal skin lesion that was cultured for herpes simplex virus could have been a manifestation of staphylococcal infection.\\nInfection with S. aureus or group A streptococcus must also be considered as a possible cause of the pulmonary disease in this child. Streptococcus pneumoniae would be the most likely cause of bacterial pneumonia in a child of this age, but S. aureus and group A streptococcus are less frequent causes and are more often associated with parapneumonic effusion. S. aureus pneumonia, which occurs mostly in infants rather than older children, usually causes lobar consolidation or disease involving multiple lobes and is often associated with a pneumatocele; bronchopneumonia is less common, and spontaneous pneumothorax may occur. Pleural effusions are present in up to 80 percent of children with S. aureus pneumonia; in most cases, the effusions are empyemas and are positive on culture. In one large series of infants, S. aureus infection accounted for 38 percent of all parapneumonic effusions. Respiratory distress is prominent in most infants with S. aureus pneumonia, and the respiratory illness and findings on chest radiographs often progress rapidly during the first few days of the disease. In two studies of S. aureus pneumonia in children, a rash was present in 6 percent and 8 percent of the patients.\\nGroup A streptococcus is a rare cause of pneumonia in infants, and it results in a severe illness. Bronchopneumonia is the most common radiologic finding and is frequently associated with pleural involvement, almost always in the form of empyema. Respiratory distress is often severe at presentation, and rapid clinical and radiographic progression is common. Bacteremia is relatively frequent, and the throat culture is often positive. As in cases of S. aureus pneumonia, the onset of fever and respiratory symptoms is typically acute. Pneumonia caused by either organism is often preceded by a viral infection of the respiratory tract.\\nAlthough pneumonia caused by group A streptococcus or S. aureus could account for many of the findings in this case, the long duration of fever before admission and the absence of respiratory symptoms, of a leftward shift in the white-cell count, and of defervescence despite intravenous administration of vancomycin for a week suggest that neither organism caused the pneumonia. The diagnosis of group A streptococcal pneumonia in particular is inconsistent with the clinical and radiographic findings, the negative throat and blood cultures, and the negative test for antibody to deoxyribonuclease B in this patient.\\nA pulmonary infiltrate and a fever that does not respond to antibiotics in a child with a strongly positive tuberculin test obviously suggest the diagnosis of tuberculosis, despite the absence of a history of exposure. False positive tuberculin tests have been reported in both typical cases of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome and those associated with S. aureus infection. Other common causes of false positive tuberculin tests include prior vaccination with BCG, exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria, and incorrect interpretation of the test results. The extent of induration in this patient and her age make sensitization by nontuberculous mycobacteria unlikely.\\nThe severity of this child\\'s fever, its duration and lack of response to antimicrobial agents, the absence of pronounced respiratory symptoms and signs despite radiographic evidence of extensive pulmonary disease, and the elevated sedimentation rate are all consistent with the presence of primary tuberculosis. The elevated white-cell count does not rule out the diagnosis, and the absence of neutrophilia is more characteristic of tuberculosis than of other bacterial pneumonias.\\nIn considering the diagnosis of tuberculosis, one must look for the components of a primary complex, but a primary focus may be inapparent, or the regional lymphadenopathy may be hidden by the heart or other structures. This patient\\'s radiographs do not show enlarged lymph nodes that can be distinguished from the pulmonary infiltrate. Miller and Wallgren emphasized that tuberculosis often cannot be differentiated radiologically from other bacterial pneumonias, particularly when discrete hilar lymphadenopathy is not apparent. Although a CT scan may show lymphadenopathy, it may not provide additional diagnostic information, as in this case.\\nPleural effusions are uncommon in children, particularly infants, with primary pulmonary tuberculosis. Pleural effusion, or “serofibrinous pleurisy,” was found in 8 percent of children with primary tuberculosis in one series, and the proportion was higher in a study of Scandinavian children conducted in the era before antibiotic treatment was available. Pleural effusion, which is considered to be the result of a strong hypersensitivity reaction to pleural or subpleural tubercle bacilli, occurs most often in children with erythema nodosum. The effusion typically occurs one to six months after the onset of reactivity on skin testing.\\nPleural effusion in a child with primary tuberculosis is associated with the occurrence of a high temperature, which typically lasts one to three weeks. The fluid is characteristically an exudate, with a moderate number of cells, an elevated protein level, and a moderately elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, as in this case. Although a predominance of lymphocytes is typical, neutrophils may account for a substantial number or even a majority of the cells found in the fluid. A stain for acid-fast bacilli is usually negative, and culture yields mycobacteria in only about one fourth of the cases. Pleural biopsy provides a higher yield than culture of pleural fluid in adults with tuberculous pleural effusions, but there are few data on its value in children.\\nThe cutaneous and mucosal findings in this child are more difficult to attribute to tuberculosis. The characteristic skin manifestations of tuberculosis are erythema nodosum, a hypersensitivity phenomenon, and tuberculids, which are the result of disseminated infection. I am not aware of reports noting an association between tuberculosis and a diffuse erythematous rash with subsequent desquamation. The mucosal changes in this patient are consistent with the presence of primary tuberculosis. Upper respiratory tract findings, specifically oropharyngeal erythema and coryza, have been reported in children with primary tuberculosis.\\nThis patient\\'s conjunctival injection could have been phlyctenular conjunctivitis, an uncommon hypersensitivity manifestation of tuberculosis, although this explanation seems unlikely. Careful examination of the eye would probably distinguish tuberculosis-associated phlyctenules, which are usually unilateral, have a characteristic appearance, and tend to occur on the limbus, from the bulbar conjunctival injection of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, which tends to spare the limbus. The presence of a diffuse erythematous rash and the resolution of both the rash and the conjunctival injection during the first few days of hospitalization, however, suggest that the red eyes resulted from the same process that caused the rash and were not a manifestation of tuberculosis.\\nI can think of at least three plausible explanations for this child\\'s illness. The first is that she had atypical Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, which caused the cutaneous and mucosal findings, persistent fever, and a false positive tuberculin test. According to this explanation, the pneumonia was of bacterial origin, probably pneumococcal or staphylococcal. Some of the findings, however, are inconsistent with the diagnosis of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, and others argue against pneumococcal or staphylococcal pneumonia.\\nA second explanation is that the child had S. aureus toxin-mediated fever, rash, and conjunctival injection, perhaps preceded by influenza or another viral infection of the respiratory tract. S. aureus caused the pneumonia, according to this explanation, and the tuberculin test was falsely positive. However, the prolonged fever before hospitalization, the absence of respiratory symptoms, the exudative nature of the effusion, and the lack of response to antibiotic therapy argue against this explanation.\\nThe third explanation is that the child had primary pulmonary tuberculosis, which caused the persistent fever and the lung infiltrate with pleural effusion. The absence of respiratory symptoms and of a response to antibiotic therapy is consistent with this diagnosis. According to this explanation, a second disease — either atypical Kawasaki\\'s syndrome or a disease caused by S. aureus or streptococcal toxin — caused the rash and mucosal abnormalities.\\nTwo diagnostic procedures would be appropriate for this child. One is repeated echocardiography to look for evidence of coronary-artery aneurysms or pericardial effusion. The other is a bronchoscopic procedure to obtain a specimen on which to base the diagnosis of an infectious process in the lung — for example, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and possibly a biopsy. I believe that bronchoscopy was performed and that evidence of tuberculosis was found.\\nDR. ALICE W. NEWTON: The radiologic findings led us away from the diagnosis of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, and we decided not to administer immune globulin. As the case evolved, the father\\'s possible exposure to tuberculosis raised our suspicion that the child had tuberculosis.\\nDR. MARK S. PASTERNAK: We could not rule out the additional possibility that the cutaneous and mucosal findings were related to the amoxicillin that the child received. In view of the persistent pneumonitis, high temperature, very high white-cell count, and pleural effusion, however, we favored the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia with empyema.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\nBacterial pneumonia with empyema.\\n? Pulmonary tuberculosis.\\n\\nDR. ROBERT N. HUSSON\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nPrimary pulmonary tuberculosis.\\nStaphylococcus aureus colonization with toxin-mediated rash and conjunctivitis or atypical Kawasaki\\'s syndrome.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: The diagnostic procedure was bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. The right upper lobe from the bronchus to the anterior segment was collapsed because of external compression. The surgeon passed a small, flexible catheter through the narrowed bronchus and obtained thick, white secretions from the distal bronchus. Examination of smears of this material showed beaded acid-fast mycobacteria (Fig. 3), which proved to be Mycobacterium tuberculosis on culture.\\nThe child did not have any of the predisposing factors for infantile tuberculosis, which include chronic illness, malnutrition, and acute systemic infection such as measles or varicella. Since the disease was primarily pulmonary and was presumably acquired by inhalation, there was probably a contact in the household or hospital nursery who had active tuberculosis. The incubation period for primary acquired tuberculosis is 2 to 10 weeks. The onset in children is often asymptomatic, and symptoms of cough, anorexia, and failure to gain weight are often less pronounced than one would expect from the extent of the disease. The mortality rate associated with tuberculosis is higher in infancy than in later childhood. In the era before antibiotics were available, collapse of the lung occurred regularly in children with tuberculosis, in part because of marked hilar lymphadenopathy, which is often more prominent than the parenchymal focus.\\nWe do not have a biopsy specimen from this patient. The microscopical features of primary pulmonary tuberculosis in infants differ from those in adults, with more extensive necrosis, a larger number of neutrophils, a more diffuse histiocytic reaction with fewer and less compact granulomas, and more organisms in infants.\\nDR. NEWTON: The infant was discharged while receiving isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, and she is now clinically well. Her condition is being monitored by a public health nurse, who visits the house three times a week. An extensive evaluation of the family, which had emigrated from Haiti, revealed that her father had bilateral cavitary disease. He is currently undergoing therapy. The mother had a positive tuberculin skin test with purified protein derivative, but a chest film showed normal findings.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "{'query': 'A 10-month-old girl was admitted to the hospital because of fever and a rash.\\nShe had apparently been well until one month earlier, when she was examined because of fever and an erythematous rash suggestive of scarlet fever. A throat culture was negative. The rash improved after a 10-day course of amoxicillin. A diagnosis of roseola was made. A few days later, the skin on the arms and legs began to peel. Eleven days before admission, the patient’s temperature rose to 40°C, and she became irritable, ate poorly, and had a nonproductive cough, coryza, swollen lips, and lingual erythema. She was referred to this hospital.\\nThe girl had been born after a full-term pregnancy. Her immunizations were up to date. She had lost 0.45 kg in weight during the previous two weeks. There was no history of travel or exposure to tuberculosis, sick persons, or animals, and there was no family history of allergy.\\nThe temperature was 39.7°C, the pulse was 120, and the respirations were 46. The blood pressure was 115/65 mm Hg.\\nExamination revealed a diffuse erythematous rash with desquamation on the legs, toes, and fingers, with cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. The conjunctivae were erythematous, and there was nasal discharge. The lips were swollen, and the tongue and pharynx were reddened. The left tympanic membrane was white. The results of an ophthalmoscopic examination were normal. The lungs were clear, and the heart was normal.\\nThe urine was positive for protein (+) and for ketones (+); the sediment contained no red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power field. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). Radiographs of the chest (Fig. 1) revealed pneumonia in the right upper lobe with a small pleural effusion. While the patient was breathing ambient air, the oxygen saturation was 99 percent. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 193. The results of a cardiac ultrasonographic study were normal. A throat culture yielded group A, B-hemolytic streptococci; a swab from an inguinal lesion was negative for herpes simplex virus.\\nSpecimens of urine and blood were obtained for culture. Clarithromycin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and aspirin were given orally, and vancomycin was given intravenously. The temperature ranged from 38.6 to 40.8°C during the next five days. The rash began to clear after the first day.\\nOn the third hospital day, a tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative, 5 TU) was positive at 24 hours, a test for candida antigen was positive, and a test for mumps antigen was negative. All culture specimens remained negative. Repeated chest radiographs showed pneumonia of the right upper lobe with a larger pleural effusion. More extensive history taking revealed that the infant\\'s father had been exposed to tuberculosis many years earlier and might have received treatment with isoniazid.\\nOn the fourth hospital day, the rash continued to resolve. The tuberculin skin test remained positive, with 22 mm of induration at 48 hours. Laboratory tests were performed (Table 1). The findings on radiographs of the chest were unchanged. A right-sided thoracentesis yielded 2 ml of fluid for analysis (Table 3). While the infant was in the fasting state, three specimens of gastric contents were obtained on consecutive days for mycobacterial cultures; microscopical examination of the specimens showed no acid-fast bacilli.\\nOn the fifth hospital day, occasional wheezes were heard. Repeated chest radiographs showed right-upper-lobe pneumonia with a free-flowing pleural effusion. Ceftriaxone was administered intravenously. On the next day, influenza A viral antigen was detected in a specimen of nasal washings. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest (Fig. 2), obtained without intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed right-upper-lobe pneumonia with a moderate pleural effusion, but no lymphadenopathy. On the seventh hospital day, the temperature rose to 40.9°C.\\nOn the eighth hospital day, laboratory tests were performed (Table 1). All bacteriologic cultures remained negative.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. ROBERT N. HUSSON*: May we review the radiographic findings?\\nDR. ROBERT T. BRAMSON: The chest radiograph obtained on admission (Fig. 1) shows a dense consolidation in the right upper lobe and hilum, with a small pleural effusion. The thoracic CT scan (Fig. 2) shows similar findings.\\nDR. HUSSON: The remarkable features of this child\\'s illness are its biphasic course and the combination of persistent fever, cutaneous and mucosal abnormalities, a positive tuberculin test, a pulmonary infiltrate, and a pleural effusion. These findings meet the criteria for pulmonary tuberculosis and possibly those for Kawasaki\\'s syndrome (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome). Both diseases may be difficult to diagnose, because a positive culture is obtained in less than half the cases of pediatric tuberculosis, and there is no definitive diagnostic test for Kawasaki\\'s syndrome. I shall discuss this case in the context of these two disorders, as well as several others.\\nKawasaki\\'s syndrome is an idiopathic systemic vasculitis that primarily affects infants and young children. Originally described in Japanese children in the 1960s, it is now recognized to occur worldwide in children of all ethnic groups, although its prevalence remains highest in children of Asian ancestry. The epidemiology of the disease and the occurrence of seasonal epidemics suggest an infectious cause. The clinical features include fever; a polymorphous erythematous rash, often with perineal accentuation; bilateral conjunctival injection; lymphadenopathy, which is usually unilateral and cervical; oral changes such as oropharyngeal erythema, strawberry tongue, and red, cracked lips; and indurative edema of the fingers and toes and erythema of the palms or soles, with periungual desquamation of the fingers and toes during convalescence. The diagnostic criteria comprise fever of at least five days\\' duration and four of the other five findings. Some children, particularly those under one year of age, may have atypical, or incomplete, Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, with persistent fever but fewer than four of the other findings.\\nThe main complication of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome is the development of coronary-artery aneurysms, which occur in 20 to 25 percent of untreated patients, generally appear in the subacute stage of the illness, and may lead to sudden death. The risk of aneurysm formation is highest in young infants and may be correlated with the duration of the fever. The administration of a single high dose of intravenous immune globulin and long-term administration of aspirin markedly reduce the frequency of aneurysms.\\nTo what extent can Kawasaki\\'s syndrome account for this child\\'s illness? Her prolonged fever, rash, conjunctival injection, and oral changes clearly suggest the diagnosis. Other findings, however, are less consistent with it. The lymphadenopathy is diffuse rather than focal. The nature and location of the desquamation are atypical; in particular, the peeling after the first episode of fever involved the legs, toes, and fingers rather than a periungual distribution. Other aspects of this case that do not support this diagnosis include the absence of uveitis and the absence of coronary-artery aneurysms in a child at high risk — that is, a child under one year of age who had a fever for more than 10 days and did not receive immune globulin. Therefore, at most, a diagnosis of incomplete, or atypical, Kawasaki\\'s syndrome would be warranted in this case. Nevertheless, the duration of this child\\'s fever, the relatively high frequency of incomplete manifestations of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome in infants, the low toxicity of therapy, and the importance of preventing coronary-artery aneurysms would warrant the administration of immune globulin and aspirin in the absence of an alternative diagnosis.\\nIf this child had Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, what caused the positive tuberculin test and the pulmonary infiltrate? Soon after Kawasaki\\'s syndrome was first described, it was noted that erythema and edema developed at the site of prior vaccination with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) in some Japanese children with the disease. In a subsequent prospective study, this reaction occurred in approximately one third of the children. It was not associated with detectable mycobacterial replication, and it resolved during the convalescent stage of the disease. Inflammation at sites of recent tuberculin tests was also reported.\\nThese observations led Bertotto and colleagues to perform tuberculin testing in 11 children with well-documented Kawasaki\\'s syndrome and a control group of 50 children. All the children with Kawasaki\\'s syndrome had strongly positive reactions, but none of the controls did. The children with Kawasaki\\'s syndrome had negative tuberculin tests within one to two months. Peripheral-blood T cells from these children proliferated in response to purified protein derivative, in contrast to the results in the control group. Thus, tuberculin tests in patients with acute Kawasaki\\'s syndrome often have false positive results.\\nThis child\\'s lung disease, however, cannot be explained as a manifestation of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome. Pulmonary abnormalities, including infiltrates and effusions, have been reported in up to 15 percent of children with Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, but they are typically mild and transient. A dense pulmonary consolidation, as seen in this patient, has not been described.\\nWhat other diseases must one consider in the differential diagnosis of prolonged fever and rash in a child? In a series of children who were evaluated for Kawasaki\\'s syndrome but given an alternative diagnosis, 83 percent of the diagnoses were infections, including measles, group A streptococcal infection, Staphylococcus aureus infection, documented or presumed viral infections, and leptospirosis. Noninfectious disorders included drug reactions and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.\\nIn this patient, rheumatoid arthritis can be ruled out clinically. Although a reaction to amoxicillin could explain the fever and the cutaneous and mucosal changes, the lung disease is inconsistent with the diagnosis of a drug reaction, and there was no known exposure to the drug before the onset of fever. The biphasic course of the disease, the duration of fever in the second phase, the markedly elevated sedimentation rate, the desquamation, and the appearance of the lung infiltrate are evidence against the diagnosis of measles and other viral illnesses. The positive test for influenza A viral antigen is an interesting finding, but influenzavirus is unlikely to have caused this child\\'s illness. Although influenza followed by a bacterial pneumonia could account for prolonged fever and focal pulmonary consolidation, one would not expect to find influenza A virus 17 days after the onset of the febrile illness that it caused.\\nInfection caused by S. aureus or group A streptococcus is an important consideration in this child. Both organisms can produce toxins capable of causing many of the signs and symptoms in this patient, simulating Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, with a diffuse erythematous rash, subsequent desquamation, conjunctival injection, and oropharyngeal erythema. Strains of S. aureus that have been associated with this type of illness usually produce toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) and less frequently produce one or more of the other staphylococcal enterotoxins. Streptococcal strains associated with these findings produce exotoxin A or B.\\nIn infants, the term “staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome\" has been applied to both typical cases with a positive Nikolsky\\'s sign and cases that more closely resemble scarlet fever. Lina and colleagues recently reported a strong correlation between the type of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and the specific toxin expressed. Staphylococcal strains causing typical staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome or bullous impetigo were found to produce exfoliative toxin A or B, or both, whereas strains causing staphylococcal scarlet fever predominantly produced TSST-1 or an enterotoxin.\\nThe similarities between a disease associated with staphylococcal or streptococcal toxin and Kawasaki\\'s syndrome have led investigators to search for evidence of staphylococcal or streptococcal infection in children with Kawasaki\\'s syndrome. Coronary-artery aneurysms have been reported in a few children with staphylococcal infections. In a prospective study, Leung and colleagues identified colonization or infection with toxin-producing S. aureus or group A streptococcus in 13 of 16 patients with well-documented Kawasaki\\'s syndrome. Although others have not found a convincing association between infection with S. aureus or group A streptococcus and Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, the fact that these organisms can cause diseases that share many features of the syndrome suggests that they may have a role in its pathogenesis in some patients.\\nThis patient\\'s illness is consistent with the presence of a disease caused by a staphylococcal or streptococcal toxin. The skin peeling that is a feature of the convalescent phase of both Kawasaki\\'s syndrome and TSST-1-mediated disease occurs predominantly on the hands and feet; periungual desquamation is more characteristic of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome than of TSST-1-mediated disease. The skin tends to peel in sheets. The desquamation that follows streptococcal scarlet fever is usually more diffuse and is characterized by fine flaking of the skin.\\nWhat could have been the source of infection or colonization with S. aureus or group A streptococcus in this patient? Pharyngeal colonization with S. aureus would probably have been overlooked on the routine throat culture for group A streptococcus. The inguinal skin lesion that was cultured for herpes simplex virus could have been a manifestation of staphylococcal infection.\\nInfection with S. aureus or group A streptococcus must also be considered as a possible cause of the pulmonary disease in this child. Streptococcus pneumoniae would be the most likely cause of bacterial pneumonia in a child of this age, but S. aureus and group A streptococcus are less frequent causes and are more often associated with parapneumonic effusion. S. aureus pneumonia, which occurs mostly in infants rather than older children, usually causes lobar consolidation or disease involving multiple lobes and is often associated with a pneumatocele; bronchopneumonia is less common, and spontaneous pneumothorax may occur. Pleural effusions are present in up to 80 percent of children with S. aureus pneumonia; in most cases, the effusions are empyemas and are positive on culture. In one large series of infants, S. aureus infection accounted for 38 percent of all parapneumonic effusions. Respiratory distress is prominent in most infants with S. aureus pneumonia, and the respiratory illness and findings on chest radiographs often progress rapidly during the first few days of the disease. In two studies of S. aureus pneumonia in children, a rash was present in 6 percent and 8 percent of the patients.\\nGroup A streptococcus is a rare cause of pneumonia in infants, and it results in a severe illness. Bronchopneumonia is the most common radiologic finding and is frequently associated with pleural involvement, almost always in the form of empyema. Respiratory distress is often severe at presentation, and rapid clinical and radiographic progression is common. Bacteremia is relatively frequent, and the throat culture is often positive. As in cases of S. aureus pneumonia, the onset of fever and respiratory symptoms is typically acute. Pneumonia caused by either organism is often preceded by a viral infection of the respiratory tract.\\nAlthough pneumonia caused by group A streptococcus or S. aureus could account for many of the findings in this case, the long duration of fever before admission and the absence of respiratory symptoms, of a leftward shift in the white-cell count, and of defervescence despite intravenous administration of vancomycin for a week suggest that neither organism caused the pneumonia. The diagnosis of group A streptococcal pneumonia in particular is inconsistent with the clinical and radiographic findings, the negative throat and blood cultures, and the negative test for antibody to deoxyribonuclease B in this patient.\\nA pulmonary infiltrate and a fever that does not respond to antibiotics in a child with a strongly positive tuberculin test obviously suggest the diagnosis of tuberculosis, despite the absence of a history of exposure. False positive tuberculin tests have been reported in both typical cases of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome and those associated with S. aureus infection. Other common causes of false positive tuberculin tests include prior vaccination with BCG, exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria, and incorrect interpretation of the test results. The extent of induration in this patient and her age make sensitization by nontuberculous mycobacteria unlikely.\\nThe severity of this child\\'s fever, its duration and lack of response to antimicrobial agents, the absence of pronounced respiratory symptoms and signs despite radiographic evidence of extensive pulmonary disease, and the elevated sedimentation rate are all consistent with the presence of primary tuberculosis. The elevated white-cell count does not rule out the diagnosis, and the absence of neutrophilia is more characteristic of tuberculosis than of other bacterial pneumonias.\\nIn considering the diagnosis of tuberculosis, one must look for the components of a primary complex, but a primary focus may be inapparent, or the regional lymphadenopathy may be hidden by the heart or other structures. This patient\\'s radiographs do not show enlarged lymph nodes that can be distinguished from the pulmonary infiltrate. Miller and Wallgren emphasized that tuberculosis often cannot be differentiated radiologically from other bacterial pneumonias, particularly when discrete hilar lymphadenopathy is not apparent. Although a CT scan may show lymphadenopathy, it may not provide additional diagnostic information, as in this case.\\nPleural effusions are uncommon in children, particularly infants, with primary pulmonary tuberculosis. Pleural effusion, or “serofibrinous pleurisy,” was found in 8 percent of children with primary tuberculosis in one series, and the proportion was higher in a study of Scandinavian children conducted in the era before antibiotic treatment was available. Pleural effusion, which is considered to be the result of a strong hypersensitivity reaction to pleural or subpleural tubercle bacilli, occurs most often in children with erythema nodosum. The effusion typically occurs one to six months after the onset of reactivity on skin testing.\\nPleural effusion in a child with primary tuberculosis is associated with the occurrence of a high temperature, which typically lasts one to three weeks. The fluid is characteristically an exudate, with a moderate number of cells, an elevated protein level, and a moderately elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, as in this case. Although a predominance of lymphocytes is typical, neutrophils may account for a substantial number or even a majority of the cells found in the fluid. A stain for acid-fast bacilli is usually negative, and culture yields mycobacteria in only about one fourth of the cases. Pleural biopsy provides a higher yield than culture of pleural fluid in adults with tuberculous pleural effusions, but there are few data on its value in children.\\nThe cutaneous and mucosal findings in this child are more difficult to attribute to tuberculosis. The characteristic skin manifestations of tuberculosis are erythema nodosum, a hypersensitivity phenomenon, and tuberculids, which are the result of disseminated infection. I am not aware of reports noting an association between tuberculosis and a diffuse erythematous rash with subsequent desquamation. The mucosal changes in this patient are consistent with the presence of primary tuberculosis. Upper respiratory tract findings, specifically oropharyngeal erythema and coryza, have been reported in children with primary tuberculosis.\\nThis patient\\'s conjunctival injection could have been phlyctenular conjunctivitis, an uncommon hypersensitivity manifestation of tuberculosis, although this explanation seems unlikely. Careful examination of the eye would probably distinguish tuberculosis-associated phlyctenules, which are usually unilateral, have a characteristic appearance, and tend to occur on the limbus, from the bulbar conjunctival injection of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, which tends to spare the limbus. The presence of a diffuse erythematous rash and the resolution of both the rash and the conjunctival injection during the first few days of hospitalization, however, suggest that the red eyes resulted from the same process that caused the rash and were not a manifestation of tuberculosis.\\nI can think of at least three plausible explanations for this child\\'s illness. The first is that she had atypical Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, which caused the cutaneous and mucosal findings, persistent fever, and a false positive tuberculin test. According to this explanation, the pneumonia was of bacterial origin, probably pneumococcal or staphylococcal. Some of the findings, however, are inconsistent with the diagnosis of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, and others argue against pneumococcal or staphylococcal pneumonia.\\nA second explanation is that the child had S. aureus toxin-mediated fever, rash, and conjunctival injection, perhaps preceded by influenza or another viral infection of the respiratory tract. S. aureus caused the pneumonia, according to this explanation, and the tuberculin test was falsely positive. However, the prolonged fever before hospitalization, the absence of respiratory symptoms, the exudative nature of the effusion, and the lack of response to antibiotic therapy argue against this explanation.\\nThe third explanation is that the child had primary pulmonary tuberculosis, which caused the persistent fever and the lung infiltrate with pleural effusion. The absence of respiratory symptoms and of a response to antibiotic therapy is consistent with this diagnosis. According to this explanation, a second disease — either atypical Kawasaki\\'s syndrome or a disease caused by S. aureus or streptococcal toxin — caused the rash and mucosal abnormalities.\\nTwo diagnostic procedures would be appropriate for this child. One is repeated echocardiography to look for evidence of coronary-artery aneurysms or pericardial effusion. The other is a bronchoscopic procedure to obtain a specimen on which to base the diagnosis of an infectious process in the lung — for example, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and possibly a biopsy. I believe that bronchoscopy was performed and that evidence of tuberculosis was found.\\nDR. ALICE W. NEWTON: The radiologic findings led us away from the diagnosis of Kawasaki\\'s syndrome, and we decided not to administer immune globulin. As the case evolved, the father\\'s possible exposure to tuberculosis raised our suspicion that the child had tuberculosis.\\nDR. MARK S. PASTERNAK: We could not rule out the additional possibility that the cutaneous and mucosal findings were related to the amoxicillin that the child received. In view of the persistent pneumonitis, high temperature, very high white-cell count, and pleural effusion, however, we favored the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia with empyema.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\nBacterial pneumonia with empyema.\\n? Pulmonary tuberculosis.\\n\\nDR. ROBERT N. HUSSON\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nPrimary pulmonary tuberculosis.\\nStaphylococcus aureus colonization with toxin-mediated rash and conjunctivitis or atypical Kawasaki\\'s syndrome.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: The diagnostic procedure was bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. The right upper lobe from the bronchus to the anterior segment was collapsed because of external compression. The surgeon passed a small, flexible catheter through the narrowed bronchus and obtained thick, white secretions from the distal bronchus. Examination of smears of this material showed beaded acid-fast mycobacteria (Fig. 3), which proved to be Mycobacterium tuberculosis on culture.\\nThe child did not have any of the predisposing factors for infantile tuberculosis, which include chronic illness, malnutrition, and acute systemic infection such as measles or varicella. Since the disease was primarily pulmonary and was presumably acquired by inhalation, there was probably a contact in the household or hospital nursery who had active tuberculosis. The incubation period for primary acquired tuberculosis is 2 to 10 weeks. The onset in children is often asymptomatic, and symptoms of cough, anorexia, and failure to gain weight are often less pronounced than one would expect from the extent of the disease. The mortality rate associated with tuberculosis is higher in infancy than in later childhood. In the era before antibiotics were available, collapse of the lung occurred regularly in children with tuberculosis, in part because of marked hilar lymphadenopathy, which is often more prominent than the parenchymal focus.\\nWe do not have a biopsy specimen from this patient. The microscopical features of primary pulmonary tuberculosis in infants differ from those in adults, with more extensive necrosis, a larger number of neutrophils, a more diffuse histiocytic reaction with fewer and less compact granulomas, and more organisms in infants.\\nDR. NEWTON: The infant was discharged while receiving isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, and she is now clinically well. Her condition is being monitored by a public health nurse, who visits the house three times a week. An extensive evaluation of the family, which had emigrated from Haiti, revealed that her father had bilateral cavitary disease. He is currently undergoing therapy.

PAUKER, M.D.A 44-year-old, previously healthy man present-ed with a three-week history of fatigue and tem-peratures as high as 38.2°C (100.8°F). The manwas a medical resident at a municipal hospital.Despite the long list of causes of fever and fatigue,I would be most worried about occupationally relat-ed illnesses, such as primary human immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis in its pro-dromal phase.The fevers usually occurred at the end of theday and were associated with myalgias and chills.The patient began to take acetaminophen. Hewas seen at a local emergency room for epigas-tric pain, where a physical examination, a com-plete blood count, electrolyte levels, and radio-graphs of the kidneys, ureter, and bladder wereall normal. In the previous week he had noticedsome shortness of breath when he was climbingstairs, a dry cough, and a single episode of nightsweats. He had lost 2.7 kg in weight in the pre-ceding six months. A review of organ systemswas otherwise unremarkable.At what time of year did this occur? Normally,body temperature peaks in the evening and is lowestin the early morning. Swings in body temperaturetend to be a little wider in febrile states.

Schistosomiasis and strongyloidiasisare endemic in the Caribbean. It is inconceivable tome that this man has not been exposed to tubercu-losis, given his personal and professional history.The patient appeared to be in good health.His vital signs and temperature were normal.Physical examination was unremarkable.

Varicella ispossible but unlikely in the absence of skin lesions.I would obtain a chest film, especially given the pa-tient's occupational history. Varicella can cause a se-vere pneumonia, often associated with hemoptysis.In its wake, the findings on the chest film are almostpathognomonic, with very tiny (2 to 3 mm), denselycalcified, perfectly round lesions that are too smallto be anything but varicella.A chest film showed numerous small nodulesbilaterally in a miliary pattern. The right hilum,right paratracheal region, and aorticopulmonarywindow appeared slightly larger than they hadone year earlier and were thought to reflect thepresence of enlarged lymph nodes. An infec-tious-disease consultant thought that the likeli-hood of tuberculosis was high.I would test the patient for tuberculosis while theworkup proceeds. The diagnostic yield of a sputumspecimen from a patient with miliary tuberculosis isnot as good as in patients with cavitary lesions.

At this point, the likelihood of tuberculosisis roughly 70 percent. If this patient were in Califor-nia, fungal diseases, such as coccidioidomycosis,would be higher on my list. I would dilate his pupilsand search his optic fundi for granulomas, which ifpresent, would rule out the possibility of varicella.The results of the PPD skin test were negative,with a positive reaction to control antigens.Bronchoscopy revealed mild-to-moderate bron-chial inflammation; examination of bronchoalve-olar-lavage fluid was negative for cancer. A trans-bronchial biopsy revealed compact, noncaseatinggranulomas with occasional giant cells, consis-tent with the presence of sarcoidosis. Stainingfor acid-fast bacilli and methenamine staining forfungi were negative.Although noncaseating granulomas are compati-ble with the presence of sarcoidosis, they are alsocompatible with the presence of many other things.The negative acid-fast stain does not rule out tuber-culosis. This man does not have anergy, and I wouldhave expected his PPD skin test to be positive be-cause he had received BCG vaccine. Tuberculosiscan occur in people who have received BCG vaccine.I would still treat him for tuberculosis until the re-sults of the culture become available.

Treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, py-razinamide, and ethambutol was begun. The pa-tient was advised not to return to work for twoweeks. His wife was asked to undergo a PPD skintest and chest radiography.The angiotensin-converting-enzyme level is nei-ther specific nor sensitive enough to rule out sarcoid-osis, because it can be abnormal in any patient witha granulomatous process. I would still seek furtherevidence of sarcoidosis: I would check the patient'salkaline phosphatase level and examine his lacrimaland parotid glands. If his wife's chest film is also ab-normal, the likelihood of tuberculosis would increase.The patient continued to have fevers, and twoweeks later, his shortness of breath became moresevere. Cultures for mycobacteria remained nega-tive. Treatment with 60 mg of prednisone perday was begun because of the possibility of sar-coidosis. Because the patient was not anergic andhad potentially been exposed to tuberculosis in the past as a physician and in India, antitubercu-losis therapy was continued pending final cultureresults.I am in thorough agreement with this approach.What does alarm me, however, is the patient's in-creasing dyspnea. He appears to be receiving ade-quate antituberculosis therapy, so the progressive-symptoms could indicate a resistant strain of myco-bacterium.

Be concise and grounded.\\n\\n# PATIENT CASE\\nAn 82-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute renal failure.\\nThe patient had had diabetes mellitus for 30 years, complicated by nephropathy, retinopathy, a mild neuropathy, and orthostatic hypotension with dizziness. She had taken insulin for 20 years. She underwent percutaneous coronary angioplasty eight years before admission. One year before admission, an occipital-lobe infarction occurred; the results of noninvasive carotid-artery studies were normal. Additional disorders included hyperlipidemia and hypertension.\\nTwo weeks before admission, the patient entered another hospital because of syncope, fever, abdominal tenderness, and a plasma glucose level of 27 mg per deciliter (1.5 mmol per liter) while she was receiving glucose and troglitazone. The urine was normal. Tests of liver function were normal except for an elevated alkaline phosphatase level. The urea nitrogen level was 32 mg per deciliter (11 mmol per liter), and the creatinine level was 2.2 mg per deciliter (194.5 µmol per liter). A thoracic radiograph showed normal findings. The patient had persistent fever, with a peak temperature of 38.2°C. The white-cell count remained normal. A tuberculin skin test was positive, with 20 mm of induration. Two blood cultures were negative. A cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study showed an old occipital-lobe infarct on the right side. A magnetic resonance angiographic examination showed multiple segmental stenoses. An ultrasonographic examination of the right upper abdominal quadrant revealed numerous gallstones. The results of a computed tomographic (CT) examination of the abdomen were normal. A CT scan of the chest showed possibly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.\\nOn the seventh hospital day, the temperature rose to 38.9°C, and the patient had recurrent chills. A pustule had appeared at a venipuncture site, and a blood culture yielded S. aureus. On the 11th hospital day, the urea nitrogen level rose to 57 mg per deciliter (20 mmol per liter), and the creatinine level rose to 5.1 mg per deciliter (450.8 µmol per liter) while the patient was receiving furosemide and enalapril and during the administration of nafcillin, which was given after a single dose of vancomycin. Microscopical examination of the urine showed no eosinophils. The patient was transferred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was a retired shopkeeper. She had been a volunteer in a pediatric hospital for the previous 10 years and had received annual tuberculin skin tests. All the skin tests, including the most recent one, which was performed one year before admission, were negative.\\nThe temperature was 39.1°C, the pulse was 84, and the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was lethargic. The carotid pulses were + bilaterally. The lungs were clear. A grade 2 systolic murmur was heard. There was marked tenderness over the right upper abdominal quadrant. A stool specimen was negative for occult blood.\\nThe urine was positive (+) for protein; the sediment contained 10 to 20 red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power field. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). An electrocardiogram showed normal findings. Chest radiographs showed fine reticulonodular opacities in both lungs, especially at the bases; the cardiomediastinal contour appeared normal. A cardiac ultrasonographic examination revealed calcification of the posterior mitral annulus. An ultrasonographic examination of the right upper abdominal quadrant (Fig. 1) revealed multiple small gallstones within the gallbladder, without pericholecystic fluid, thickening of the gallbladder wall, or biliary-duct dilatation.\\nSpecimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and vancomycin, ofloxacin, and metronidazole were administered. The abdominal tenderness slowly improved, although low-grade fever persisted. The patient had an infrequent, nonproductive cough. Inspiratory crackles were heard at both lung bases. Blood and urine cultures remained negative. On the fourth hospital day, packed red cells were administered. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2).\\nOn the fifth day, chest pain and dyspnea developed, and electrocardiograms revealed elevated precordial ST segments. Thoracic radiographs showed additional nodular opacities that were diffuse and ill defined, with a right-sided pleural effusion, and radiographs obtained later in the day showed patchy and confluent opacities in both lungs. A coronary angiographic examination revealed major areas of stenosis in several arteries. Nitroglycerin was administered intravenously, with improvement in the chest pain and dyspnea, but on the seventh day, both symptoms recurred. An intraaortic balloon pump was inserted; aspirin, ticlopidine, and heparin were administered. Abrupt bouts of pulmonary edema were managed with diuretics and nitrates. A cardiac ultrasonographic study showed apical akinesis and inferoseptal hypokinesis. The creatine kinase level remained normal or low, and the chest pain subsided. Another bout of worsening renal function followed the coronary angiographic examination. Repeated blood and urine cultures were negative. Another unit of packed red cells was transfused. Treatment with vancomycin, ofloxacin, and metronidazole was continued. On the ninth day, the patient was weaned from the intraaortic balloon pump.\\nOn the 10th day, laboratory tests were performed (Tables 2 and 3). No Bence Jones protein was detected in a 50-fold concentrated specimen of urine. On the next day, an abdominal MRI scan showed slight ostial stenosis of the left renal artery and severe ostial stenosis of the right renal artery; the left kidney was 9.4 cm long, and the right kidney was 9.1 cm long. Pulmonary edema persisted and was treated more aggressively with diuretics. All antibiotics were discontinued on the 11th day. On the 13th day, a tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative, 5 TU) was negative; no control antigens were injected. On the next day, laboratory tests were performed (Table 2).\\nOn the 15th day, crackles remained present at both lung bases. The patient was depressed, very tired, and anorectic. Paroxetine was given orally. On the next day, abdominal ultrasonographic study showed only multiple gallstones. On the 17th day, a CT scan of the thorax (Fig. 2) revealed central and peripheral ground-glass opacities and diffusely distributed nodular opacities, 2 to 4 mm in diameter, as well as a precarinal lymph node, 1.2 cm in diameter. A urine culture yielded Enterobacter cloacae. Treatment with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was begun.\\nOn the 21st day, a cardiac ultrasonographic examination showed that the size of the left ventricle was normal, with no obvious wall-motion abnormalities; the ejection fraction was 57 percent. The temperature rose to 37.9°C, and there was moderate tenderness over the gallbladder. Laboratory tests were performed (Table 2). An abdominal ultrasonographic examination revealed gallstones with sludge. On the 22nd day, laboratory tests were performed (Table 1).\\nOn the 24th day, the temperature rose to 39.6°C, with chills, sweats, and increased tenderness over the gallbladder. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, with perioperative administration of ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole. An intraoperative cholangiographic examination showed normal findings. Microscopical examination of the excised gallbladder showed chronic cholecystitis. On the 27th day, the perioperative antibiotic treatment was discontinued. The temperature rose to 38.8°C, and low-grade fever was present on most subsequent days.\\nOn the 30th day, pulmonary-function studies were performed (Table 4). The findings were interpreted as indicating a severe ventilatory defect, probably caused by the combined obstructive and restrictive processes, and were consistent with the presence of interstitial lung disease. Repeated culture specimens were negative. On the 34th day and thereafter, the temperature ranged from 37.9°C to 38.2°C. On the 37th day, laboratory tests were repeated (Tables 1, 2, and 3).\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. MICHAEL A. LEW*: May we review the radiologic findings?\\nDR. THERESA C. MCLOUD: The chest radiograph obtained on admission shows fine reticular opacities at both lung bases. A radiograph obtained on the fifth hospital day shows confluent bilateral pulmonary opacities with discrete nodules, 5 to 6 mm in diameter. An ultrasonogram of the gallbladder obtained on admission (Fig. 1) reveals only the presence of gallstones.\\nA CT scan of the chest (Fig. 2) obtained on the 17th hospital day shows linear and nodular opacities, 2 to 4 mm in diameter, and patchy ground-glass opacities along vessels and airways. A high-resolution CT scan reveals septal thickening, a finding consistent with the presence of interstitial lung disease. An abdominal MRI scan shows marked ostial stenosis of the right renal artery, minor narrowing of the left renal artery, and ostial stenosis of the celiac axis.\\nDR. LEW: This patient had several serious diseases that made it difficult for her physicians to discern features of her present illness that might have been caused by a superimposed disease. My task is to tease out the findings noted in the case record that would be unlikely manifestations of the patient's preexisting diseases.\\nThe first feature is fever, which was present for an unknown interval before admission and persisted throughout the patient's hospitalization. Two nosocomial infections — S. aureus bacteremia associated with the placement of an intravenous catheter and a urinary tract infection — can explain the fever. However, the fever preceded these infections and persisted despite appropriate antibacterial treatment, and it must therefore be considered a cardinal feature of the new illness.\\nThe second feature of the present illness is the involvement of multiple organs: the heart, kidneys, respiratory tract, hepatobiliary system, bone marrow, and central nervous system. The involvement of some organs can be attributed to the patient's preexisting diseases. For example, coronary artery disease can explain the reversible ischemia and depression of left ventricular function. Diabetic nephropathy can account for the varying degrees of renal insufficiency, and the added insults of nosocomial infection, reduced left ventricular function, and vigorous diuresis aggravated the renal problem, at least temporarily. Once these factors were corrected, however, renal function returned to its base-line level, even as the new illness progressed. The patient's lethargy and anorexia are attributable to metabolic derangements, the physiologic stresses of illness, and perhaps depression. The clinicians were sufficiently concerned about central nervous system dysfunction to obtain images of the brain and its vessels, but there was no evidence of cerebral arteriosclerosis, so the central nervous system dysfunction does not help identify the new illness.\\nThe organ dysfunction that cannot be explained by the patient's preexisting diseases involved the lungs, liver, and bone marrow. Her mild but persistent cough and the crackles at the lung bases, even when there was no other evidence of congestive heart failure, the progressive pulmonary radiographic changes, and the evidence of severe obstructive and restrictive defects that were consistent with the presence of interstitial disease indicate pulmonary involvement by a new illness. The persistently abnormal liver-function tests, with the serum alkaline phosphatase level rising progressively even after a cholecystectomy, indicate an infiltrative hepatic process. The elevated value for 5'-nucleotidase confirms that the excess alkaline phosphatase was of hepatic origin. The absence of notable findings during and after the laparoscopic cholecystectomy supports this conclusion. The anemia, which persisted after partial correction by red-cell transfusions, the relative lymphopenia, and the thrombocytopenia point to bone marrow dysfunction.\\nThe recurrent abdominal pain and tenderness, an initial reason for the patient's hospitalization, clearly puzzled her physicians. Four abdominal ultrasonographic examinations showed multiple gallstones, without evidence of biliary obstruction or active inflammation in or around the gallbladder. Finally, microscopical examination of the excised gallbladder revealed only chronic cholecystitis. The cholecystectomy did not abolish the fever.\\nMy diagnosis must therefore account for new abnormalities in the lungs, liver, and bone marrow and must also explain the abdominal pain. Systemic vasculitis could explain the fever and multiorgan dysfunction, but atherosclerosis provides a better explanation of the various vascular stenoses, and there is little laboratory evidence of systemic vasculitis. Occult cancer is also unlikely, since extensive imaging failed to provide any hint of it.\\nInfection best explains the new features of this patient's illness. Pyogenic bacteria are not likely to be the causative organisms. Appropriate treatment of her two nosocomial bacterial infections did not abolish the fever, and follow-up blood cultures were sterile. The absence of endocardial vegetations on cardiac ultrasonography and the presence of a clear portal of entry in the skin greatly diminish the likelihood of infective endocarditis caused by S. aureus. The long duration of the patient's illness makes viral infection unlikely. A disseminated fungal infection, such as histoplasmosis or blastomycosis, could have accounted for the clinical findings, but the patient apparently had not resided in or visited areas where these infections are endemic.\\nMy leading diagnosis is miliary tuberculosis. The clinical features of the illness fit this diagnosis well, and the history supports it, since there were opportunities for exposure to tuberculosis. Because of the patient's hospital work, she had undergone periodic tuberculin skin testing, and the results had always been negative. Against this background, the positive reaction at the referring hospital reflected recent infection, with skin-test conversion. The negative reaction on retesting three weeks later is explained by the serious intervening illness; the patient may have become anergic, although anergy was not confirmed by the injection of control antigens. Approximately 50 percent of patients with miliary tuberculosis do not have a reaction to 5 TU of purified protein derivative, and most of the patients who do not have a reaction are anergic. The percentage of patients with positive tests is higher in early stages of the illness than in later stages, suggesting that in some cases, the body loses its ability to respond as the illness progresses.\\nFor most of its history, miliary tuberculosis has affected the very young, with more than a third of cases occurring in children under the age of three years. Although this age distribution still prevails in some parts of the world, a remarkable shift to the middle-aged and elderly has occurred in Europe and North America. The illness was formerly fatal in all cases. Chemotherapy has markedly reduced the mortality rate, but it is still high — 16 to 28 percent — after treatment with isoniazid-containing regimens. In young persons, miliary tuberculosis usually develops within three to six months after exposure and reflects a failure of the immune system to contain the primary infection. Many affected children have “primary-type” radiographic lesions. In the elderly, miliary tuberculosis often follows the recrudescence of a latent focus, but primary-type infections are increasingly frequent in elderly members of populations in which childhood infection rates are low. In the case under discussion, the documented skin-test conversion and the absence of calcified lesions on chest radiography suggest that a primary-type infection was the source of the miliary tuberculosis.\\nHost factors associated with miliary tuberculosis include low socioeconomic status, ethanol abuse, and treatment with immunosuppressive medications, especially corticosteroids. The onset of the illness is usually insidious, and the initial manifestations do not favor a timely diagnosis. Most patients have nonspecific symptoms, including fever, sweats, chills, anorexia, and weight loss. Cough occurs in slightly over half the cases. The median duration of symptoms is approximately four weeks. Abdominal pain is only occasionally an initial symptom, reflecting either tuberculous peritonitis or abdominal lymphadenitis. A prominent headache suggests the presence of tuberculous meningitis, and a lumbar puncture should therefore be performed. Some authors advocate lumbar punctures in all patients in whom miliary tuberculosis is suspected.\\nMost of the physical findings associated with miliary tuberculosis are also nonspecific. Crackles, which were heard in this patient, are present in 72 percent of patients. Choroidal tubercles are the only characteristic physical findings, but although they are relatively common in children with miliary tuberculosis, they appear late in the illness and are found in only 2 to 7 percent of affected adults.\\nThe most recognizable feature of miliary tuberculosis is the presence of miliary lesions on chest films. Although it is commonly believed that these lesions are always 2 mm or less in diameter, 10 percent of patients in a recent study had nodules that were more than 3 mm in diameter. Unfortunately, 9 to 37 percent of patients do not have characteristic miliary lesions initially, although they develop later in many cases, as they did in the present case.\\nRoutine laboratory studies may suggest the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis by demonstrating bone marrow, hepatic, and pulmonary infiltration. Virtually any derangement in hematopoiesis can be seen, including (in descending order of frequency) lymphopenia, anemia, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and a leftward shift in the white-cell differential count. Occasionally, a vigorous leukemoid reaction suggests the presence of a hematopoietic tumor. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated in over half of patients with miliary tuberculosis. The results of liver-function tests are abnormal in over 80 percent of patients. The most frequent abnormality is an elevation of the serum alkaline phosphatase level, but hypoalbuminemia, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, hypercalcemia, and hyponatremia are also common. Hyponatremia, which is associated with inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, is seen in many other types of infiltrating lung disorders, as well as miliary tuberculosis.\\nThe main challenge for the clinician is to establish the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis with a level of certainty that permits the timely administration of chemotherapy. There are many ways to make the diagnosis. Unfortunately, sputum smears for the detection of acid-fast bacilli have low sensitivity (about 35 percent), and smears of body fluids are even less sensitive. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be cultured from sputum specimens in 62 to 76 percent of cases and from urine specimens in 33 to 59 percent of cases, but a positive result takes a long time to obtain with the usual culture methods, and even sputum cultures do not have adequate sensitivity. A timely diagnosis usually requires histologic examination. Liver or bone marrow biopsy is usually performed. The only microscopical findings that provide a secure diagnosis are caseating granulomas and acid-fast bacilli. It is generally acknowledged that liver biopsy is more sensitive (33 to 73 percent) than bone marrow aspiration (14 to 41 percent). Technological advances have made lung tissue easier to sample than it once was. The sensitivity of transbronchoscopic biopsy ranges from 62 to 79 percent, apparently exceeding that of liver biopsy. Transthoracoscopic lung biopsy is probably even more sensitive, because a much larger quantity of tissue is obtained.\\nThe dramatic advances in the use of immunologic and molecular techniques to diagnose many diseases seem to have largely bypassed tuberculosis. However, there have been a few encouraging advances. The first is the development of methods for culturing mycobacteria in liquid medium, often coupled with radiometric or colorimetric methods for rapid detection of growth. The second is the development of methods for detecting specific DNA and RNA sequences of M. tuberculosis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These methods have excellent positive predictive value when they are used to assay smears of clinical specimens that contain acid-fast bacilli, but their predictive value is decreased somewhat in smears that are negative for acid-fast bacilli. These methods also provide an accurate means of identifying mycobacteria that have been grown in culture. At the moment, PCR-based techniques appear to be valuable as adjuncts to microscopy and culture, but they may be good enough to stand on their own in the future.\\nI would be remiss if I did not mention the form of disseminated tuberculosis that we now see much more often than the typical form: disseminated tuberculosis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Tuberculosis is much more likely to be found at extrapulmonary sites in patients with HIV infection than in those who are immunologically healthy. In HIV-positive patients, tuberculosis progresses more rapidly, disseminates to a wider variety of sites, especially lymph nodes, is associated with high rates of bacillemia and bacilluria, and does not cause the characteristic granulomas at sites of infection. One fortunate finding is that the rates of response to chemotherapy among patients with HIV infection are similar to those among immunocompetent patients.\\nShould I be dismayed by the absence of evidence of tuberculosis in the resected gallbladder? My review of the literature did not provide a satisfactory answer to this question. Tuberculosis occasionally involves the biliary tree, most often by infection of porta hepatis lymph nodes, with subsequent stricture of the common bile duct. However, isolated involvement of the gallbladder is rare.\\nIn summary, my diagnosis is miliary tuberculosis. Any number of procedures could have established the diagnosis. M. tuberculosis may have been cultured from an early specimen of sputum or urine, but the diagnosis was probably confirmed by liver, bone marrow, or lung biopsy.\\nDR. TIMOTHY J. FRIEL: This case presented a diagnostic challenge to all the physicians involved in the patient's care. We considered many diagnoses to explain her recurrent pyrexia, including catheter-associated thrombophlebitis and bacteremia, urinary tract infections, allergic interstitial nephritis due to treatment with nafcillin, aspiration pneumonitis, and recurrent cholecystitis, but the constellation of persistent fever, radiologic lesions, multisystem abnormalities, and most important, the report of the positive tuberculin test from the referring hospital led us to favor the diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis. We recommended a liver biopsy because of the increasing alkaline phosphatase level. The diagnosis was granulomatous hepatitis; special stains revealed no acid-fast or fungal organisms.\\nAround this time, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered. We learned that the patient's son had been treated for sarcoidosis for the previous 10 years. After extensive discussion, we decided to administer low-dose corticosteroids, with concurrent isoniazid prophylaxis.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\n? Miliary tuberculosis, ? sarcoidosis.\\nDR. MICHAEL A. LEW'S DIAGNOSIS\\nMiliary tuberculosis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. FIONA M. GRAEME-COOK: Microscopical examination of the liver revealed a diffuse inflammatory process, with numerous, well-formed, noncaseating epithelioid granulomas, many of which contained Langhans' giant cells (Fig. 3). Scattered throughout the lobules were foci of degenerating necrotic hepatocytes, with a mononuclear-cell infiltrate (Fig. 4), indicating the presence of hepatitis. A mixed inflammatory infiltrate that included occasional eosinophils surrounded the granulomas and occupied the portal tracts (Fig. 5). Nonsuppurative cholangitis (infiltration of bile-duct epithelium by inflammatory cells) was also present.\\nAlthough the biopsy findings were consistent with the diagnosis of tuberculosis, it is often difficult to confirm the diagnosis on the basis of liver biopsy. Acid-fast staining has low sensitivity, with great variation in the reported frequency of positive results; the average frequency is about 10 percent. The low sensitivity probably reflects the small number of organisms that are present. A PCR assay can detect organisms in smaller numbers than acid-fast staining. Both the PCR assay and culture of liver tissue were negative for M. tuberculosis in this case. Therefore, there was no convincing evidence of liver infection.\\nSince the tuberculous granuloma is a cell-mediated reaction to the waxy outer membrane of the bacillus, the question arises whether some of the hepatic changes might have been caused by distant infection rather than by infection of the liver itself. This question has been raised in cases of disseminated bacille Calmette–Guérin infection after intravesical treatment for carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Whether the systemic granulomas seen in such cases reflect hypersensitivity or direct infection remains unclear. In the present case, the combination of cholangitis, granulomas, and eosinophils strongly suggests that the hepatic changes were due in part to hypersensitivity.\\nThere was a provisional report of mycobacterial species in a culture of an induced sputum specimen obtained on the day the liver biopsy was performed. The organisms were subsequently identified as a strain of M. tuberculosis that is sensitive to all antituberculous agents.\\nWe reexamined the gallbladder and found no evidence of tuberculous involvement.\\nADDENDUM\\nDR. FRIEL: After mycobacteria had been identified in the sputum culture, a regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was begun, and the corticosteroid medication was rapidly tapered. Unfortunately, the treatment proved almost as challenging as the diagnosis, with complications requiring dose reductions or the substitution of alternative drugs. Although the antituberculous therapy was effective, the patient's cardiac and renal function eventually deteriorated, and she died almost 11 months after her most recent illness had begun. There was no evidence of active tuberculosis at the time of her death. Her family declined a postmortem examination.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "{'query': \"An 82-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute renal failure.\\nThe patient had had diabetes mellitus for 30 years, complicated by nephropathy, retinopathy, a mild neuropathy, and orthostatic hypotension with dizziness. She had taken insulin for 20 years. She underwent percutaneous coronary angioplasty eight years before admission. One year before admission, an occipital-lobe infarction occurred; the results of noninvasive carotid-artery studies were normal. Additional disorders included hyperlipidemia and hypertension.\\nTwo weeks before admission, the patient entered another hospital because of syncope, fever, abdominal tenderness, and a plasma glucose level of 27 mg per deciliter (1.5 mmol per liter) while she was receiving glucose and troglitazone. The urine was normal. Tests of liver function were normal except for an elevated alkaline phosphatase level. The urea nitrogen level was 32 mg per deciliter (11 mmol per liter), and the creatinine level was 2.2 mg per deciliter (194.5 µmol per liter). A thoracic radiograph showed normal findings. The patient had persistent fever, with a peak temperature of 38.2°C. The white-cell count remained normal. A tuberculin skin test was positive, with 20 mm of induration. Two blood cultures were negative. A cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study showed an old occipital-lobe infarct on the right side. A magnetic resonance angiographic examination showed multiple segmental stenoses. An ultrasonographic examination of the right upper abdominal quadrant revealed numerous gallstones. The results of a computed tomographic (CT) examination of the abdomen were normal. A CT scan of the chest showed possibly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.\\nOn the seventh hospital day, the temperature rose to 38.9°C, and the patient had recurrent chills. A pustule had appeared at a venipuncture site, and a blood culture yielded S. aureus. On the 11th hospital day, the urea nitrogen level rose to 57 mg per deciliter (20 mmol per liter), and the creatinine level rose to 5.1 mg per deciliter (450.8 µmol per liter) while the patient was receiving furosemide and enalapril and during the administration of nafcillin, which was given after a single dose of vancomycin. Microscopical examination of the urine showed no eosinophils. The patient was transferred to this hospital.\\nThe patient was a retired shopkeeper. She had been a volunteer in a pediatric hospital for the previous 10 years and had received annual tuberculin skin tests. All the skin tests, including the most recent one, which was performed one year before admission, were negative.\\nThe temperature was 39.1°C, the pulse was 84, and the respirations were 18. The blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was lethargic. The carotid pulses were + bilaterally. The lungs were clear. A grade 2 systolic murmur was heard. There was marked tenderness over the right upper abdominal quadrant. A stool specimen was negative for occult blood.\\nThe urine was positive (+) for protein; the sediment contained 10 to 20 red cells, 3 to 5 white cells, and a few bacteria per high-power field. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). An electrocardiogram showed normal findings. Chest radiographs showed fine reticulonodular opacities in both lungs, especially at the bases; the cardiomediastinal contour appeared normal. A cardiac ultrasonographic examination revealed calcification of the posterior mitral annulus. An ultrasonographic examination of the right upper abdominal quadrant (Fig. 1) revealed multiple small gallstones within the gallbladder, without pericholecystic fluid, thickening of the gallbladder wall, or biliary-duct dilatation.\\nSpecimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and vancomycin, ofloxacin, and metronidazole were administered. The abdominal tenderness slowly improved, although low-grade fever persisted. The patient had an infrequent, nonproductive cough. Inspiratory crackles were heard at both lung bases. Blood and urine cultures remained negative. On the fourth hospital day, packed red cells were administered. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2).\\nOn the fifth day, chest pain and dyspnea developed, and electrocardiograms revealed elevated precordial ST segments. Thoracic radiographs showed additional nodular opacities that were diffuse and ill defined, with a right-sided pleural effusion, and radiographs obtained later in the day showed patchy and confluent opacities in both lungs. A coronary angiographic examination revealed major areas of stenosis in several arteries. Nitroglycerin was administered intravenously, with improvement in the chest pain and dyspnea, but on the seventh day, both symptoms recurred. An intraaortic balloon pump was inserted; aspirin, ticlopidine, and heparin were administered. Abrupt bouts of pulmonary edema were managed with diuretics and nitrates. A cardiac ultrasonographic study showed apical akinesis and inferoseptal hypokinesis. The creatine kinase level remained normal or low, and the chest pain subsided. Another bout of worsening renal function followed the coronary angiographic examination. Repeated blood and urine cultures were negative. Another unit of packed red cells was transfused. Treatment with vancomycin, ofloxacin, and metronidazole was continued. On the ninth day, the patient was weaned from the intraaortic balloon pump.\\nOn the 10th day, laboratory tests were performed (Tables 2 and 3). No Bence Jones protein was detected in a 50-fold concentrated specimen of urine. On the next day, an abdominal MRI scan showed slight ostial stenosis of the left renal artery and severe ostial stenosis of the right renal artery; the left kidney was 9.4 cm long, and the right kidney was 9.1 cm long. Pulmonary edema persisted and was treated more aggressively with diuretics. All antibiotics were discontinued on the 11th day. On the 13th day, a tuberculin skin test (purified protein derivative, 5 TU) was negative; no control antigens were injected. On the next day, laboratory tests were performed (Table 2).\\nOn the 15th day, crackles remained present at both lung bases. The patient was depressed, very tired, and anorectic. Paroxetine was given orally. On the next day, abdominal ultrasonographic study showed only multiple gallstones. On the 17th day, a CT scan of the thorax (Fig. 2) revealed central and peripheral ground-glass opacities and diffusely distributed nodular opacities, 2 to 4 mm in diameter, as well as a precarinal lymph node, 1.2 cm in diameter. A urine culture yielded Enterobacter cloacae. Treatment with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was begun.\\nOn the 21st day, a cardiac ultrasonographic examination showed that the size of the left ventricle was normal, with no obvious wall-motion abnormalities; the ejection fraction was 57 percent. The temperature rose to 37.9°C, and there was moderate tenderness over the gallbladder. Laboratory tests were performed (Table 2). An abdominal ultrasonographic examination revealed gallstones with sludge. On the 22nd day, laboratory tests were performed (Table 1).\\nOn the 24th day, the temperature rose to 39.6°C, with chills, sweats, and increased tenderness over the gallbladder. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, with perioperative administration of ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole. An intraoperative cholangiographic examination showed normal findings. Microscopical examination of the excised gallbladder showed chronic cholecystitis. On the 27th day, the perioperative antibiotic treatment was discontinued. The temperature rose to 38.8°C, and low-grade fever was present on most subsequent days.\\nOn the 30th day, pulmonary-function studies were performed (Table 4). The findings were interpreted as indicating a severe ventilatory defect, probably caused by the combined obstructive and restrictive processes, and were consistent with the presence of interstitial lung disease. Repeated culture specimens were negative. On the 34th day and thereafter, the temperature ranged from 37.9°C to 38.2°C. On the 37th day, laboratory tests were repeated (Tables 1, 2, and 3).\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. MICHAEL A. LEW*: May we review the radiologic findings?\\nDR. THERESA C. MCLOUD: The chest radiograph obtained on admission shows fine reticular opacities at both lung bases. A radiograph obtained on the fifth hospital day shows confluent bilateral pulmonary opacities with discrete nodules, 5 to 6 mm in diameter. An ultrasonogram of the gallbladder obtained on admission (Fig. 1) reveals only the presence of gallstones.\\nA CT scan of the chest (Fig. 2) obtained on the 17th hospital day shows linear and nodular opacities, 2 to 4 mm in diameter, and patchy ground-glass opacities along vessels and airways. A high-resolution CT scan reveals septal thickening, a finding consistent with the presence of interstitial lung disease. An abdominal MRI scan shows marked ostial stenosis of the right renal artery, minor narrowing of the left renal artery, and ostial stenosis of the celiac axis.\\nDR. LEW: This patient had several serious diseases that made it difficult for her physicians to discern features of her present illness that might have been caused by a superimposed disease. My task is to tease out the findings noted in the case record that would be unlikely manifestations of the patient's preexisting diseases.\\nThe first feature is fever, which was present for an unknown interval before admission and persisted throughout the patient's hospitalization. Two nosocomial infections — S. aureus bacteremia associated with the placement of an intravenous catheter and a urinary tract infection — can explain the fever. However, the fever preceded these infections and persisted despite appropriate antibacterial treatment, and it must therefore be considered a cardinal feature of the new illness.\\nThe second feature of the present illness is the involvement of multiple organs: the heart, kidneys, respiratory tract, hepatobiliary system, bone marrow, and central nervous system. The involvement of some organs can be attributed to the patient's preexisting diseases. For example, coronary artery disease can explain the reversible ischemia and depression of left ventricular function. Diabetic nephropathy can account for the varying degrees of renal insufficiency, and the added insults of nosocomial infection, reduced left ventricular function, and vigorous diuresis aggravated the renal problem, at least temporarily. Once these factors were corrected, however, renal function returned to its base-line level, even as the new illness progressed. The patient's lethargy and anorexia are attributable to metabolic derangements, the physiologic stresses of illness, and perhaps depression. The clinicians were sufficiently concerned about central nervous system dysfunction to obtain images of the brain and its vessels, but there was no evidence of cerebral arteriosclerosis, so the central nervous system dysfunction does not help identify the new illness.\\nThe organ dysfunction that cannot be explained by the patient's preexisting diseases involved the lungs, liver, and bone marrow. Her mild but persistent cough and the crackles at the lung bases, even when there was no other evidence of congestive heart failure, the progressive pulmonary radiographic changes, and the evidence of severe obstructive and restrictive defects that were consistent with the presence of interstitial disease indicate pulmonary involvement by a new illness. The persistently abnormal liver-function tests, with the serum alkaline phosphatase level rising progressively even after a cholecystectomy, indicate an infiltrative hepatic process. The elevated value for 5'-nucleotidase confirms that the excess alkaline phosphatase was of hepatic origin. The absence of notable findings during and after the laparoscopic cholecystectomy supports this conclusion. The anemia, which persisted after partial correction by red-cell transfusions, the relative lymphopenia, and the thrombocytopenia point to bone marrow dysfunction.\\nThe recurrent abdominal pain and tenderness, an initial reason for the patient's hospitalization, clearly puzzled her physicians. Four abdominal ultrasonographic examinations showed multiple gallstones, without evidence of biliary obstruction or active inflammation in or around the gallbladder. Finally, microscopical examination of the excised gallbladder revealed only chronic cholecystitis. The cholecystectomy did not abolish the fever.\\nMy diagnosis must therefore account for new abnormalities in the lungs, liver, and bone marrow and must also explain the abdominal pain. Systemic vasculitis could explain the fever and multiorgan dysfunction, but atherosclerosis provides a better explanation of the various vascular stenoses, and there is little laboratory evidence of systemic vasculitis. Occult cancer is also unlikely, since extensive imaging failed to provide any hint of it.\\nInfection best explains the new features of this patient's illness. Pyogenic bacteria are not likely to be the causative organisms. Appropriate treatment of her two nosocomial bacterial infections did not abolish the fever, and follow-up blood cultures were sterile. The absence of endocardial vegetations on cardiac ultrasonography and the presence of a clear portal of entry in the skin greatly diminish the likelihood of infective endocarditis caused by S. aureus. The long duration of the patient's illness makes viral infection unlikely. A disseminated fungal infection, such as histoplasmosis or blastomycosis, could have accounted for the clinical findings, but the patient apparently had not resided in or visited areas where these infections are endemic.\\nMy leading diagnosis is miliary tuberculosis. The clinical features of the illness fit this diagnosis well, and the history supports it, since there were opportunities for exposure to tuberculosis. Because of the patient's hospital work, she had undergone periodic tuberculin skin testing, and the results had always been negative. Against this background, the positive reaction at the referring hospital reflected recent infection, with skin-test conversion. The negative reaction on retesting three weeks later is explained by the serious intervening illness; the patient may have become anergic, although anergy was not confirmed by the injection of control antigens. Approximately 50 percent of patients with miliary tuberculosis do not have a reaction to 5 TU of purified protein derivative, and most of the patients who do not have a reaction are anergic. The percentage of patients with positive tests is higher in early stages of the illness than in later stages, suggesting that in some cases, the body loses its ability to respond as the illness progresses.\\nFor most of its history, miliary tuberculosis has affected the very young, with more than a third of cases occurring in children under the age of three years. Although this age distribution still prevails in some parts of the world, a remarkable shift to the middle-aged and elderly has occurred in Europe and North America. The illness was formerly fatal in all cases. Chemotherapy has markedly reduced the mortality rate, but it is still high — 16 to 28 percent — after treatment with isoniazid-containing regimens. In young persons, miliary tuberculosis usually develops within three to six months after exposure and reflects a failure of the immune system to contain the primary infection. Many affected children have “primary-type” radiographic lesions. In the elderly, miliary tuberculosis often follows the recrudescence of a latent focus, but primary-type infections are increasingly frequent in elderly members of populations in which childhood infection rates are low. In the case under discussion, the documented skin-test conversion and the absence of calcified lesions on chest radiography suggest that a primary-type infection was the source of the miliary tuberculosis.\\nHost factors associated with miliary tuberculosis include low socioeconomic status, ethanol abuse, and treatment with immunosuppressive medications, especially corticosteroids. The onset of the illness is usually insidious, and the initial manifestations do not favor a timely diagnosis. Most patients have nonspecific symptoms, including fever, sweats, chills, anorexia, and weight loss. Cough occurs in slightly over half the cases. The median duration of symptoms is approximately four weeks. Abdominal pain is only occasionally an initial symptom, reflecting either tuberculous peritonitis or abdominal lymphadenitis. A prominent headache suggests the presence of tuberculous meningitis, and a lumbar puncture should therefore be performed. Some authors advocate lumbar punctures in all patients in whom miliary tuberculosis is suspected.\\nMost of the physical findings associated with miliary tuberculosis are also nonspecific. Crackles, which were heard in this patient, are present in 72 percent of patients. Choroidal tubercles are the only characteristic physical findings, but although they are relatively common in children with miliary tuberculosis, they appear late in the illness and are found in only 2 to 7 percent of affected adults.\\nThe most recognizable feature of miliary tuberculosis is the presence of miliary lesions on chest films. Although it is commonly believed that these lesions are always 2 mm or less in diameter, 10 percent of patients in a recent study had nodules that were more than 3 mm in diameter. Unfortunately, 9 to 37 percent of patients do not have characteristic miliary lesions initially, although they develop later in many cases, as they did in the present case.\\nRoutine laboratory studies may suggest the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis by demonstrating bone marrow, hepatic, and pulmonary infiltration. Virtually any derangement in hematopoiesis can be seen, including (in descending order of frequency) lymphopenia, anemia, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and a leftward shift in the white-cell differential count. Occasionally, a vigorous leukemoid reaction suggests the presence of a hematopoietic tumor. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated in over half of patients with miliary tuberculosis. The results of liver-function tests are abnormal in over 80 percent of patients. The most frequent abnormality is an elevation of the serum alkaline phosphatase level, but hypoalbuminemia, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, hypercalcemia, and hyponatremia are also common. Hyponatremia, which is associated with inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, is seen in many other types of infiltrating lung disorders, as well as miliary tuberculosis.\\nThe main challenge for the clinician is to establish the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis with a level of certainty that permits the timely administration of chemotherapy. There are many ways to make the diagnosis. Unfortunately, sputum smears for the detection of acid-fast bacilli have low sensitivity (about 35 percent), and smears of body fluids are even less sensitive. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be cultured from sputum specimens in 62 to 76 percent of cases and from urine specimens in 33 to 59 percent of cases, but a positive result takes a long time to obtain with the usual culture methods, and even sputum cultures do not have adequate sensitivity. A timely diagnosis usually requires histologic examination. Liver or bone marrow biopsy is usually performed. The only microscopical findings that provide a secure diagnosis are caseating granulomas and acid-fast bacilli. It is generally acknowledged that liver biopsy is more sensitive (33 to 73 percent) than bone marrow aspiration (14 to 41 percent). Technological advances have made lung tissue easier to sample than it once was. The sensitivity of transbronchoscopic biopsy ranges from 62 to 79 percent, apparently exceeding that of liver biopsy. Transthoracoscopic lung biopsy is probably even more sensitive, because a much larger quantity of tissue is obtained.\\nThe dramatic advances in the use of immunologic and molecular techniques to diagnose many diseases seem to have largely bypassed tuberculosis. However, there have been a few encouraging advances. The first is the development of methods for culturing mycobacteria in liquid medium, often coupled with radiometric or colorimetric methods for rapid detection of growth. The second is the development of methods for detecting specific DNA and RNA sequences of M. tuberculosis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These methods have excellent positive predictive value when they are used to assay smears of clinical specimens that contain acid-fast bacilli, but their predictive value is decreased somewhat in smears that are negative for acid-fast bacilli. These methods also provide an accurate means of identifying mycobacteria that have been grown in culture. At the moment, PCR-based techniques appear to be valuable as adjuncts to microscopy and culture, but they may be good enough to stand on their own in the future.\\nI would be remiss if I did not mention the form of disseminated tuberculosis that we now see much more often than the typical form: disseminated tuberculosis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Tuberculosis is much more likely to be found at extrapulmonary sites in patients with HIV infection than in those who are immunologically healthy. In HIV-positive patients, tuberculosis progresses more rapidly, disseminates to a wider variety of sites, especially lymph nodes, is associated with high rates of bacillemia and bacilluria, and does not cause the characteristic granulomas at sites of infection. One fortunate finding is that the rates of response to chemotherapy among patients with HIV infection are similar to those among immunocompetent patients.\\nShould I be dismayed by the absence of evidence of tuberculosis in the resected gallbladder? My review of the literature did not provide a satisfactory answer to this question. Tuberculosis occasionally involves the biliary tree, most often by infection of porta hepatis lymph nodes, with subsequent stricture of the common bile duct. However, isolated involvement of the gallbladder is rare.\\nIn summary, my diagnosis is miliary tuberculosis. Any number of procedures could have established the diagnosis. M. tuberculosis may have been cultured from an early specimen of sputum or urine, but the diagnosis was probably confirmed by liver, bone marrow, or lung biopsy.\\nDR. TIMOTHY J. FRIEL: This case presented a diagnostic challenge to all the physicians involved in the patient's care. We considered many diagnoses to explain her recurrent pyrexia, including catheter-associated thrombophlebitis and bacteremia, urinary tract infections, allergic interstitial nephritis due to treatment with nafcillin, aspiration pneumonitis, and recurrent cholecystitis, but the constellation of persistent fever, radiologic lesions, multisystem abnormalities, and most important, the report of the positive tuberculin test from the referring hospital led us to favor the diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis. We recommended a liver biopsy because of the increasing alkaline phosphatase level. The diagnosis was granulomatous hepatitis; special stains revealed no acid-fast or fungal organisms.\\nAround this time, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered. We learned that the patient's son had been treated for sarcoidosis for the previous 10 years. After extensive discussion, we decided to administer low-dose corticosteroids, with concurrent isoniazid prophylaxis.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\n? Miliary tuberculosis, ? sarcoidosis.\\nDR. MICHAEL A. LEW'S DIAGNOSIS\\nMiliary tuberculosis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. FIONA M. GRAEME-COOK: Microscopical examination of the liver revealed a diffuse inflammatory process, with numerous, well-formed, noncaseating epithelioid granulomas, many of which contained Langhans' giant cells (Fig. 3). Scattered throughout the lobules were foci of degenerating necrotic hepatocytes, with a mononuclear-cell infiltrate (Fig. 4), indicating the presence of hepatitis. A mixed inflammatory infiltrate that included occasional eosinophils surrounded the granulomas and occupied the portal tracts (Fig. 5). Nonsuppurative cholangitis (infiltration of bile-duct epithelium by inflammatory cells) was also present.\\nAlthough the biopsy findings were consistent with the diagnosis of tuberculosis, it is often difficult to confirm the diagnosis on the basis of liver biopsy. Acid-fast staining has low sensitivity, with great variation in the reported frequency of positive results; the average frequency is about 10 percent. The low sensitivity probably reflects the small number of organisms that are present. A PCR assay can detect organisms in smaller numbers than acid-fast staining. Both the PCR assay and culture of liver tissue were negative for M. tuberculosis in this case. Therefore, there was no convincing evidence of liver infection.\\nSince the tuberculous granuloma is a cell-mediated reaction to the waxy outer membrane of the bacillus, the question arises whether some of the hepatic changes might have been caused by distant infection rather than by infection of the liver itself. This question has been raised in cases of disseminated bacille Calmette–Guérin infection after intravesical treatment for carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Whether the systemic granulomas seen in such cases reflect hypersensitivity or direct infection remains unclear. In the present case, the combination of cholangitis, granulomas, and eosinophils strongly suggests that the hepatic changes were due in part to hypersensitivity.\\nThere was a provisional report of mycobacterial species in a culture of an induced sputum specimen obtained on the day the liver biopsy was performed. The organisms were subsequently identified as a strain of M. tuberculosis that is sensitive to all antituberculous agents.\\nWe reexamined the gallbladder and found no evidence of tuberculous involvement.\\nADDENDUM\\nDR. FRIEL: After mycobacteria had been identified in the sputum culture, a regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was begun, and the corticosteroid medication was rapidly tapered. Unfortunately, the treatment proved almost as challenging as the diagnosis, with complications requiring dose reductions or the substitution of alternative drugs. Although the antituberculous therapy was effective, the patient's cardiac and renal function eventually deteriorated, and she died almost 11 months after her most recent illness had begun. There was no evidence of active tuberculosis at the time of her death. Her family declined a postmortem examination.\", 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"WORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Miliary tuberculosis, possible sarcoidosis\\nDISEASE_NAME: Miliary Tuberculosis\\n1) Information

TYPES OF PULMONARY CYSTIC\\nDISEASES.*\\nMetabolic (cystic fibrosis)\\nHyperplastic (lymphangioleiomyomatosis)\\nInflammatory (pneumatocele)\\nDegenerative (bullous or honeycomb cysts)\\nTraumatic\\nDevelopmental\\nParasitic\\n*Data are from Shamji et al.¹\\nDR. KORNFELD: The diagnosis in this case must\\naccount for the occurrence of bilateral cystic pulmo-\\nnary masses in a young woman who had an intermit-\\ntent cough and hemoptysis of nine months\\' duration,\\nminimal systemic symptoms, and a mucous plug,\\nwhich was discovered during bronchoscopy.\\nThe right-lower-lobe mass is a unilocular cyst\\nwith a thin, enhancing rim. The left-upper-lobe mass\\nalso appears to be cystic but has a more irregular\\nshape and a thicker, nodular outer margin. Cystic\\ndiseases of the lungs have been classified by Shamji\\net al.¹ into seven categories (Table 3). The features\\nof the cysts in this patient are most compatible with\\na developmental or parasitic origin.\\nBronchopulmonary sequestration is a congenital\\nabnormality that usually results in the formation of\\ncystic masses of nonfunctioning lung tissue that have\\nno normal communication with the tracheobronchial\\ntree and have a systemic arterial blood supply.2 Two\\nforms of sequestration are recognized: the intralobar\\nform is found within a pulmonary lobe, and the ex-\\ntralobar form is found in a separate pleural reflec-\\ntion. Intralobar sequestration commonly occurs in a\\nposterior basal segment and may not cause symp-\\ntoms until adulthood, when infection leads to fever,\\ncough, and hemoptysis. Bilateral intrapulmonary se-\\nquestrations are unusual.3 Upper-lobe sequestrations\\nare also rare and are often associated with cardiac\\nmalformations3,4; however, cardiac abnormalities are\\nnot a feature of the case under discussion. On the ba-\\nsis of these facts and the absence of a systemic feed-\\ning vessel on the CT scan after the administration of\\ncontrast material, I shall rule out intrapulmonary\\nsequestration.\\nBronchogenic cysts are closed sacs that result from\\nabnormal budding of the respiratory tract.5 They are\\nlined by ciliated epithelium, and their walls may con-\\ntain hyaline cartilage, smooth muscle, and bronchial\\nglands. Usually located in the mediastinum, bron-\\nchogenic cysts account for over 10 percent of all me-\\ndiastinal masses.\" In contrast, intrapulmonary bron-\\nchogenic cysts arise later during gestation, and those\\nthat communicate with the tracheobronchial tree are\\ncomplicated by recurrent infection, with cough, fever,\\nand hemoptysis.\\nBronchogenic cysts are often discovered in child-\\nhood but may be asymptomatic for long periods,\\nparticularly if they are in the lower lobes, where they\\nmay become large without impinging on major air-\\nways. Most bronchogenic cysts become symptomatic\\neventually, but sometimes not until middle age. The\\ntypical roentgenographic appearance of a bronchial\\ncyst is that of a solitary, round, fluid-filled mass in\\nthe middle third of the lung.7 The average diameter\\nis about 5 cm, but occasionally, the diameter exceeds\\n10 cm.8 Infection of the cyst results in communica-\\ntion with the tracheobronchial tree, allowing air\\nwith or without fluid to enter the lumen of the cyst.\\nThe features of the right-lower-lobe lesion in the\\npatient under discussion are compatible with those\\nof an uncomplicated, asymptomatic bronchogenic\\ncyst. Similarly, the lesion in the left upper lobe has\\nsome features of an infected bronchogenic cyst. The\\npatient\\'s symptoms are also consistent with that di-\\nagnosis. Bronchogenic cysts were found in the upper\\nlobes in 28 percent of cases in one series. Multiple\\nbronchogenic cysts are rare, however. In two studies,\\nwith a combined total of 52 cases, all the cysts were\\nsolitary. 6,8 It is therefore unlikely that the lesions in\\nthis patient were bronchogenic cysts, but the diagno-\\nsis is often difficult to make preoperatively. In one\\nseries, the diagnosis was not established preoperative-\\nly in 57 percent of patients despite extensive investi-\\ngations, including CT scanning and angiography.6\\nThe remaining category of cystic lung disease rel-\\nevant to the case under discussion is parasitic disease.\\nEchinococcosis (or hydatid disease) is caused by lar-\\nvae of the class Cestoda, of which two species, Echi-\\nnococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis, are respon-\\nsible for the overwhelming majority of infestations\\nin humans.10 Of these two species, E. granulosus,\\nwhich causes cystic echinococcosis, has a wider geo-\\ngraphic distribution, although it is concentrated in\\npastoral regions, especially where sheep are raised.11\\nE. multilocularis causes alveolar echinococcosis, which\\nhas been reported in central Europe, Russia, China,\\nand North America. Humans are exposed less fre-\\nquently to this agent than to E. granulosus, however,\\nbecause E. multilocularis infestation is usually as-\\nsociated with animals in wild ecosystems, especially\\nfoxes, wolves, and mice. A third species, E. vogeli,\\nwhich causes polycystic hydatid disease, is restricted\\nto Central and South America. Only a few cases of\\ndisease in humans have been attributed to a fourth\\nspecies, E. oligarthrus.12\\nThe mature E. granulosus worm resides in the in-\\ntestine of the definitive host, which is a dog or other\\ncarnivore. The worm, which is attached to the mu-\\ncosa by a double row of hooklets contained in its\\nscolex, is hermaphroditic and contains in its terminal\\nsegment (proglottid) numerous eggs that are passed\\n976\\nSeptember 23, 1999\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Intermediate hosts, which are\\nsheep or other ruminants, ingest eggs when grazing\\non contaminated ground, and the embryos of the\\nparasite are released after the chitinous layer of the\\neggs has been digested in the duodenum. Embryos\\nthen enter the portal circulation through the intes-\\ntinal wall and travel to visceral capillary beds, where\\nthey develop into cystic metacestodes. The life cycle\\nof E. granulosus is completed when carnivores ingest\\nhydatid cysts in the viscera of ruminants. Humans may\\nserve as intermediate hosts, being infected by con-\\ntact with infected dogs or by the ingestion of eggs\\nfrom contaminated food, water, or soil. The liver is the\\nmost common site of hydatid-cyst formation, fol-\\nlowed by the lung in 10 to 30 percent of cases and\\nother sites (usually the spleen, kidney, brain, or bone)\\nin about 10 percent of cases. In one series of 327 pa-\\ntients with pulmonary hydatid cysts, only 59 (18\\npercent) had extrapulmonary cysts, 54 of which\\nwere located in the liver.13 Approximately 30 percent\\nof cases involve multiple pulmonary hydatid cysts,\\n20 percent involve bilateral cysts, and 60 percent are\\nlocated in the lower lobes.14\\nThe cysts are composed of three layers. The outer\\nlayer, or pericyst, is composed of inflamed fibrous\\ntissue derived from the host; the exocyst is an acel-\\nlular laminated membrane; and the innermost layer,\\nor endocyst, is a syncytium, which forms the germi-\\nnal layer of the parasite and gives rise to brood cap-\\nsules, within which larval scolexes develop.15 An in-\\ntact cyst is filled with clear fluid. Daughter cysts may\\ndevelop directly from the endocyst, resulting in mul-\\nticystic structures. Debris within the fluid of the\\ncyst, consisting of hooklets and scolexes and referred\\nto as hydatid sand, has characteristic radiographic\\nand sonographic features.16\\nMost intact lung cysts are discovered incidentally\\non chest radiographs. They may enlarge to more than\\n20 cm in diameter and cause symptoms by com-\\npressing adjacent structures. Occasionally, an un-\\nruptured cyst results in cough, hemoptysis, or chest\\npain.13 Symptomatic hydatid disease of the lung,\\nhowever, more often follows rupture of the cyst. The\\ncyst may rupture spontaneously or as a result of trau-\\nma or secondary infection. Lewall and McCorkell17\\nidentified three types of rupture. In a contained rup-\\nture, only the endocyst is torn and the contents of\\nthe cyst are contained by the pericyst. In a commu-\\nnicating rupture, the contents of the cyst escape into\\nthe tracheobronchial tree through bronchioles that\\nhave been incorporated into the pericyst. Direct rup-\\nture follows a tear of both the endocyst and the peri-\\ncyst, with discharge of the contents of the cyst direct-\\nly into the pleural cavity. Rupture may be associated\\nwith the sudden onset of cough and fever. If the\\ncontents of the cyst are expelled into the airway, ex-\\npectoration of a clear, salty-tasting fluid or purulent\\nmaterial containing fragments of hydatid membrane\\noccurs. Acute hypersensitivity reactions ranging from\\nurticaria to life-threatening anaphylaxis may be trig-\\ngered by the rupture of a cyst. 18,19 Ruptured cysts may\\nbecome infected with bacteria or saprophytic or in-\\nvasive fungi. 20,21\\nThe typical radiographic appearance of pulmo-\\nnary hydatid disease is that of one or more homoge-\\nneous round or oval masses with smooth borders\\nsurrounded by normal lung tissue. 22 Large cysts can\\nshift the mediastinum, induce a pleural reaction, or\\ncause atelectasis of adjacent parenchyma. Impinge-\\nment on relatively rigid anatomical structures can\\nlead to irregularity, indentation, or lobulation of the\\ncyst. The fluid contents of the cyst may be identified\\nby the finding of a change in the shape of the cyst\\non serial radiographs obtained during inspiration and\\nexpiration or with the patient erect and then supine.\\nCalcification of pulmonary cysts is rare. The con-\\ntents of closed simple cysts are homogeneous, with\\na density close to that of water. 23 CT scans with con-\\ntrast medium may show a thin, enhancing rim if the\\ncyst is intact. Unruptured cysts are often indistin-\\nguishable from a variety of other pulmonary lesions,\\nbut the diagnosis may be established on the basis of\\na finding of daughter cysts attached to the endocyst\\nor lying free within the main cyst or on the basis of\\nrupture of the main cyst.\\nThe introduction of air between the pericyst and\\nexocyst produces the appearance on imaging of a\\nthin layer around the exocyst, which is referred to as\\nthe crescent, or meniscus, sign.17 Air penetrating the\\ninterior of the cyst may outline the inner surface of\\nthe exocyst, producing parallel arches of air that are\\nreferred to as Cumbo\\'s sign. Although these radio-\\ngraphic features can be diagnostic of pulmonary hy-\\ndatid disease, they are uncommon.24 If the ruptured\\ncyst communicates with the tracheobronchial tree,\\nevacuation of the contents of the cyst results in an\\nair-fluid level. The endocyst may appear to float in\\nthe remaining fluid, producing a characteristic radi-\\nographic feature known as the water-lily sign.25 Like\\nthe crescent sign, the water-lily sign, which is path-\\nognomonic of a collapsed endocyst, is encountered\\nin only a minority of cases.13,24\\nAlthough the diagnosis relies heavily on radio-\\ngraphic studies, serologic testing can provide support-\\nive evidence of echinococcosis. Enzyme-linked immu-\\nnosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect hemagglutination\\nor immunofluorescence assay, radioallergosorbent\\ntesting, and latex fixation are all sensitive methods\\nbut are compromised by nonspecific cross reactivity\\nwith helminths other than echinococcus. 26,27 A pos-\\nitive result of one of these sensitive assays should be\\nconfirmed by the use of a more specific test, such as\\nthe arc 5 immunoprecipitin band. The results of\\nstandard serologic tests are positive in over 90 per-\\ncent of patients with hepatic cysts, but in only about\\n50 percent of those with pulmonary hydatidosis.28\\nVolume 341 Number 13\\n977\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Albendazole may be slightly more efficacious\\nthan mebendazole. In one patient who had a large,\\nrecurrent pulmonary hydatid cyst for which surgery\\nposed unacceptable risks, percutaneous drainage plus\\ntreatment with albendazole was successful. 31 Medical\\ntreatment alone has been suggested by some authors\\nto be sufficient for small pulmonary hydatid cysts.34,35\\nBecause of this patient\\'s history of residence in the\\nRepublic of Georgia, a sheep-raising region, the ab-\\nsence of constitutional symptoms despite the pres-\\nence of large pulmonary masses, and the appearance\\nof the lesions on the CT scan, I believe she had bilat-\\neral pulmonary echinococcal cysts caused by E. gran-\\nulosus. The growth rate of these cysts has been re-\\nported to be 1 to 5 cm per year28; therefore, the size\\nof her cysts is compatible with exposure three years\\nearlier. The episodes of hemoptysis associated with\\nexercise might have resulted from trauma to the peri-\\ncyst of one of the lesions, probably the one in the\\nleft upper lobe. The cough and fever may have re-\\nsulted from atelectasis or secondary infection in the\\nsame area.\\nThe discovery of a mucous plug in the bronchus\\nof the left upper lobe is more difficult to explain on\\nthe basis of this diagnosis. The most common cause\\nof nonobstructive mucoid impaction in a woman of\\nthis age is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.\\nAlthough aspergillosis can occur in the absence of\\nasthma,36 in this case, the absence of eosinophilia\\nand bronchiectasis, the normal serum IgE level, and\\nthe absence of fungi on microscopical examination\\nof the mucoid material make this diagnosis very un-\\nlikely. 37-39 Mucoid impaction can occur with intralo-\\nbar sequestration or a bronchogenic cyst, but I have\\nalready ruled out those diagnoses. Congenital bron-\\nchial atresia is also associated with mucoid impac-\\ntion. It occurs in the left upper lobe and is usually\\nasymptomatic. The typical CT findings – a mucocele\\nwith a branching pattern associated with segmental\\nhyperinflation?\\nare not consistent with the CT\\nfindings in this case. Obstructive mucoid impaction\\nmay also be seen in patients with a variety of lung\\ntumors, but no endobronchial masses were noted in\\nthis patient at bronchoscopy.\\nBronchoscopy in patients with pulmonary hydatid\\ndisease may reveal collections of whitish-yellow\\ngelatinous material composed of laminated exocyst\\nmembranes in the bronchi.13,40 Cytologic examina-\\ntion of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid and brushings\\nreveals scolexes or degenerated hooklets in over half\\nthe cases, 40 and cytologic evaluation of a sputum\\nsample can sometimes be diagnostic.41 However, the\\nresults of cytologic examinations were negative in the\\npatient under discussion. The mucoid material seen\\nin this patient was probably a bronchial cast42,43 caused\\nby inflammation or infection or, possibly, by bron-\\nchial compression by the upper-lobe lesion. The di-\\nagnostic procedure may have been a serologic test for\\nE. granulosus-specific antibodies or antigens, cyto-\\nlogic examination of sputum obtained after bron-\\nchoscopy, or possibly, fine-needle aspiration.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nProbable echinococcal cysts.\\nDR.

Physical examination remained normal.\\nRadiographs of the chest (Fig. 1) showed a well-cir-\\ncumscribed mass, measuring 9 by 7 cm, in the right\\nlower lobe and a smaller mass in the anterior seg-\\nment of the left upper lobe. The cardiomediastinal\\nsilhouette was normal, and the pleural cavities were\\nclear. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the\\nthorax (Fig. 2), obtained after the administration of\\ncontrast material, showed a mass in the right lower\\nlobe, which measured 7.8 by 7.0 cm and had a\\nsmooth, enhancing, thin-walled rim. The signal with-\\nin the mass was attenuated, indicating that it was\\nfilled with fluid; no septa were seen. The mass abut-\\nted the lateral pleura without evidence of chest-wall\\ninvasion, was centered in the parenchyma, and was\\nseparate from the trachea and major bronchi.

TYPES OF PULMONARY CYSTIC\\nDISEASES.*\\nMetabolic (cystic fibrosis)\\nHyperplastic (lymphangioleiomyomatosis)\\nInflammatory (pneumatocele)\\nDegenerative (bullous or honeycomb cysts)\\nTraumatic\\nDevelopmental\\nParasitic\\n*Data are from Shamji et al.¹\\nDR. KORNFELD: The diagnosis in this case must\\naccount for the occurrence of bilateral cystic pulmo-\\nnary masses in a young woman who had an intermit-\\ntent cough and hemoptysis of nine months\\' duration,\\nminimal systemic symptoms, and a mucous plug,\\nwhich was discovered during bronchoscopy.\\nThe right-lower-lobe mass is a unilocular cyst\\nwith a thin, enhancing rim. The left-upper-lobe mass\\nalso appears to be cystic but has a more irregular\\nshape and a thicker, nodular outer margin. Cystic\\ndiseases of the lungs have been classified by Shamji\\net al.¹ into seven categories (Table 3). The features\\nof the cysts in this patient are most compatible with\\na developmental or parasitic origin.\\nBronchopulmonary sequestration is a congenital\\nabnormality that usually results in the formation of\\ncystic masses of nonfunctioning lung tissue that have\\nno normal communication with the tracheobronchial\\ntree and have a systemic arterial blood supply.2 Two\\nforms of sequestration are recognized: the intralobar\\nform is found within a pulmonary lobe, and the ex-\\ntralobar form is found in a separate pleural reflec-\\ntion. Intralobar sequestration commonly occurs in a\\nposterior basal segment and may not cause symp-\\ntoms until adulthood, when infection leads to fever,\\ncough, and hemoptysis. Bilateral intrapulmonary se-\\nquestrations are unusual.3 Upper-lobe sequestrations\\nare also rare and are often associated with cardiac\\nmalformations3,4; however, cardiac abnormalities are\\nnot a feature of the case under discussion. On the ba-\\nsis of these facts and the absence of a systemic feed-\\ning vessel on the CT scan after the administration of\\ncontrast material, I shall rule out intrapulmonary\\nsequestration.\\nBronchogenic cysts are closed sacs that result from\\nabnormal budding of the respiratory tract.5 They are\\nlined by ciliated epithelium, and their walls may con-\\ntain hyaline cartilage, smooth muscle, and bronchial\\nglands. Usually located in the mediastinum, bron-\\nchogenic cysts account for over 10 percent of all me-\\ndiastinal masses.\" In contrast, intrapulmonary bron-\\nchogenic cysts arise later during gestation, and those\\nthat communicate with the tracheobronchial tree are\\ncomplicated by recurrent infection, with cough, fever,\\nand hemoptysis.\\nBronchogenic cysts are often discovered in child-\\nhood but may be asymptomatic for long periods,\\nparticularly if they are in the lower lobes, where they\\nmay become large without impinging on major air-\\nways. Most bronchogenic cysts become symptomatic\\neventually, but sometimes not until middle age. The\\ntypical roentgenographic appearance of a bronchial\\ncyst is that of a solitary, round, fluid-filled mass in\\nthe middle third of the lung.7 The average diameter\\nis about 5 cm, but occasionally, the diameter exceeds\\n10 cm.8 Infection of the cyst results in communica-\\ntion with the tracheobronchial tree, allowing air\\nwith or without fluid to enter the lumen of the cyst.\\nThe features of the right-lower-lobe lesion in the\\npatient under discussion are compatible with those\\nof an uncomplicated, asymptomatic bronchogenic\\ncyst. Similarly, the lesion in the left upper lobe has\\nsome features of an infected bronchogenic cyst. The\\npatient\\'s symptoms are also consistent with that di-\\nagnosis. Bronchogenic cysts were found in the upper\\nlobes in 28 percent of cases in one series. Multiple\\nbronchogenic cysts are rare, however. In two studies,\\nwith a combined total of 52 cases, all the cysts were\\nsolitary. 6,8 It is therefore unlikely that the lesions in\\nthis patient were bronchogenic cysts, but the diagno-\\nsis is often difficult to make preoperatively. In one\\nseries, the diagnosis was not established preoperative-\\nly in 57 percent of patients despite extensive investi-\\ngations, including CT scanning and angiography.6\\nThe remaining category of cystic lung disease rel-\\nevant to the case under discussion is parasitic disease.\\nEchinococcosis (or hydatid disease) is caused by lar-\\nvae of the class Cestoda, of which two species, Echi-\\nnococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis, are respon-\\nsible for the overwhelming majority of infestations\\nin humans.10 Of these two species, E. granulosus,\\nwhich causes cystic echinococcosis, has a wider geo-\\ngraphic distribution, although it is concentrated in\\npastoral regions, especially where sheep are raised.11\\nE. multilocularis causes alveolar echinococcosis, which\\nhas been reported in central Europe, Russia, China,\\nand North America. Humans are exposed less fre-\\nquently to this agent than to E. granulosus, however,\\nbecause E. multilocularis infestation is usually as-\\nsociated with animals in wild ecosystems, especially\\nfoxes, wolves, and mice. A third species, E. vogeli,\\nwhich causes polycystic hydatid disease, is restricted\\nto Central and South America. Only a few cases of\\ndisease in humans have been attributed to a fourth\\nspecies, E. oligarthrus.12\\nThe mature E. granulosus worm resides in the in-\\ntestine of the definitive host, which is a dog or other\\ncarnivore. The worm, which is attached to the mu-\\ncosa by a double row of hooklets contained in its\\nscolex, is hermaphroditic and contains in its terminal\\nsegment (proglottid) numerous eggs that are passed\\n976\\nSeptember 23, 1999\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Intermediate hosts, which are\\nsheep or other ruminants, ingest eggs when grazing\\non contaminated ground, and the embryos of the\\nparasite are released after the chitinous layer of the\\neggs has been digested in the duodenum. Embryos\\nthen enter the portal circulation through the intes-\\ntinal wall and travel to visceral capillary beds, where\\nthey develop into cystic metacestodes. The life cycle\\nof E. granulosus is completed when carnivores ingest\\nhydatid cysts in the viscera of ruminants. Humans may\\nserve as intermediate hosts, being infected by con-\\ntact with infected dogs or by the ingestion of eggs\\nfrom contaminated food, water, or soil. The liver is the\\nmost common site of hydatid-cyst formation, fol-\\nlowed by the lung in 10 to 30 percent of cases and\\nother sites (usually the spleen, kidney, brain, or bone)\\nin about 10 percent of cases. In one series of 327 pa-\\ntients with pulmonary hydatid cysts, only 59 (18\\npercent) had extrapulmonary cysts, 54 of which\\nwere located in the liver.13 Approximately 30 percent\\nof cases involve multiple pulmonary hydatid cysts,\\n20 percent involve bilateral cysts, and 60 percent are\\nlocated in the lower lobes.14\\nThe cysts are composed of three layers. The outer\\nlayer, or pericyst, is composed of inflamed fibrous\\ntissue derived from the host; the exocyst is an acel-\\nlular laminated membrane; and the innermost layer,\\nor endocyst, is a syncytium, which forms the germi-\\nnal layer of the parasite and gives rise to brood cap-\\nsules, within which larval scolexes develop.15 An in-\\ntact cyst is filled with clear fluid. Daughter cysts may\\ndevelop directly from the endocyst, resulting in mul-\\nticystic structures. Debris within the fluid of the\\ncyst, consisting of hooklets and scolexes and referred\\nto as hydatid sand, has characteristic radiographic\\nand sonographic features.16\\nMost intact lung cysts are discovered incidentally\\non chest radiographs. They may enlarge to more than\\n20 cm in diameter and cause symptoms by com-\\npressing adjacent structures. Occasionally, an un-\\nruptured cyst results in cough, hemoptysis, or chest\\npain.13 Symptomatic hydatid disease of the lung,\\nhowever, more often follows rupture of the cyst. The\\ncyst may rupture spontaneously or as a result of trau-\\nma or secondary infection. Lewall and McCorkell17\\nidentified three types of rupture. In a contained rup-\\nture, only the endocyst is torn and the contents of\\nthe cyst are contained by the pericyst. In a commu-\\nnicating rupture, the contents of the cyst escape into\\nthe tracheobronchial tree through bronchioles that\\nhave been incorporated into the pericyst. Direct rup-\\nture follows a tear of both the endocyst and the peri-\\ncyst, with discharge of the contents of the cyst direct-\\nly into the pleural cavity. Rupture may be associated\\nwith the sudden onset of cough and fever. If the\\ncontents of the cyst are expelled into the airway, ex-\\npectoration of a clear, salty-tasting fluid or purulent\\nmaterial containing fragments of hydatid membrane\\noccurs. Acute hypersensitivity reactions ranging from\\nurticaria to life-threatening anaphylaxis may be trig-\\ngered by the rupture of a cyst. 18,19 Ruptured cysts may\\nbecome infected with bacteria or saprophytic or in-\\nvasive fungi. 20,21\\nThe typical radiographic appearance of pulmo-\\nnary hydatid disease is that of one or more homoge-\\nneous round or oval masses with smooth borders\\nsurrounded by normal lung tissue. 22 Large cysts can\\nshift the mediastinum, induce a pleural reaction, or\\ncause atelectasis of adjacent parenchyma. Impinge-\\nment on relatively rigid anatomical structures can\\nlead to irregularity, indentation, or lobulation of the\\ncyst. The fluid contents of the cyst may be identified\\nby the finding of a change in the shape of the cyst\\non serial radiographs obtained during inspiration and\\nexpiration or with the patient erect and then supine.\\nCalcification of pulmonary cysts is rare. The con-\\ntents of closed simple cysts are homogeneous, with\\na density close to that of water. 23 CT scans with con-\\ntrast medium may show a thin, enhancing rim if the\\ncyst is intact. Unruptured cysts are often indistin-\\nguishable from a variety of other pulmonary lesions,\\nbut the diagnosis may be established on the basis of\\na finding of daughter cysts attached to the endocyst\\nor lying free within the main cyst or on the basis of\\nrupture of the main cyst.\\nThe introduction of air between the pericyst and\\nexocyst produces the appearance on imaging of a\\nthin layer around the exocyst, which is referred to as\\nthe crescent, or meniscus, sign.17 Air penetrating the\\ninterior of the cyst may outline the inner surface of\\nthe exocyst, producing parallel arches of air that are\\nreferred to as Cumbo\\'s sign. Although these radio-\\ngraphic features can be diagnostic of pulmonary hy-\\ndatid disease, they are uncommon.24 If the ruptured\\ncyst communicates with the tracheobronchial tree,\\nevacuation of the contents of the cyst results in an\\nair-fluid level. The endocyst may appear to float in\\nthe remaining fluid, producing a characteristic radi-\\nographic feature known as the water-lily sign.25 Like\\nthe crescent sign, the water-lily sign, which is path-\\nognomonic of a collapsed endocyst, is encountered\\nin only a minority of cases.13,24\\nAlthough the diagnosis relies heavily on radio-\\ngraphic studies, serologic testing can provide support-\\nive evidence of echinococcosis. Enzyme-linked immu-\\nnosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect hemagglutination\\nor immunofluorescence assay, radioallergosorbent\\ntesting, and latex fixation are all sensitive methods\\nbut are compromised by nonspecific cross reactivity\\nwith helminths other than echinococcus. 26,27 A pos-\\nitive result of one of these sensitive assays should be\\nconfirmed by the use of a more specific test, such as\\nthe arc 5 immunoprecipitin band. The results of\\nstandard serologic tests are positive in over 90 per-\\ncent of patients with hepatic cysts, but in only about\\n50 percent of those with pulmonary hydatidosis.28\\nVolume 341 Number 13\\n977\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

All rights reserved.\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\\nThe apparent protection of lung cysts from the\\nhost immune response is also reflected by the fre-\\nquent absence of peripheral-blood eosinophilia and\\nmay be mediated in part by sequestration of host\\ncomplement factor H in the cyst wall.29 According\\nto one report, the combination of an ELISA for IgG\\nand IgA antibodies with indirect hemagglutination\\nhad a sensitivity of 81 percent in identifying isolated\\npulmonary cysts.27 The use of tests for circulating\\nand urinary hydatid antigens and for circulating hy-\\ndatid immune complexes can also increase the diag-\\nnostic sensitivity and specificity. 30\\nBecause of the possibility that the cyst could rup-\\nture and disseminate its contents, percutaneous aspira-\\ntion of lung cysts has been considered too risky to be\\nroutinely used for diagnosis, although the procedure\\nis now commonly used for the diagnosis and treatment\\nof hepatic echinococcal cysts.10 According to several\\ncase reports, this approach has also been successful\\nin patients with pulmonary hydatid disease.31,32\\nThe usual treatment of pulmonary echinococcal\\ncysts is lung-preserving surgical resection.33 Preop-\\nerative treatment with a benzimidazole is beneficial\\nin patients with hepatic disease but has not been es-\\ntablished to be of value in patients with pulmonary\\ncysts. Albendazole may be slightly more efficacious\\nthan mebendazole. In one patient who had a large,\\nrecurrent pulmonary hydatid cyst for which surgery\\nposed unacceptable risks, percutaneous drainage plus\\ntreatment with albendazole was successful. 31 Medical\\ntreatment alone has been suggested by some authors\\nto be sufficient for small pulmonary hydatid cysts.34,35\\nBecause of this patient\\'s history of residence in the\\nRepublic of Georgia, a sheep-raising region, the ab-\\nsence of constitutional symptoms despite the pres-\\nence of large pulmonary masses, and the appearance\\nof the lesions on the CT scan, I believe she had bilat-\\neral pulmonary echinococcal cysts caused by E. gran-\\nulosus. The growth rate of these cysts has been re-\\nported to be 1 to 5 cm per year28; therefore, the size\\nof her cysts is compatible with exposure three years\\nearlier. The episodes of hemoptysis associated with\\nexercise might have resulted from trauma to the peri-\\ncyst of one of the lesions, probably the one in the\\nleft upper lobe. The cough and fever may have re-\\nsulted from atelectasis or secondary infection in the\\nsame area.\\nThe discovery of a mucous plug in the bronchus\\nof the left upper lobe is more difficult to explain on\\nthe basis of this diagnosis. The most common cause\\nof nonobstructive mucoid impaction in a woman of\\nthis age is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.\\nAlthough aspergillosis can occur in the absence of\\nasthma,36 in this case, the absence of eosinophilia\\nand bronchiectasis, the normal serum IgE level, and\\nthe absence of fungi on microscopical examination\\nof the mucoid material make this diagnosis very un-\\nlikely. 37-39 Mucoid impaction can occur with intralo-\\nbar sequestration or a bronchogenic cyst, but I have\\nalready ruled out those diagnoses. Congenital bron-\\nchial atresia is also associated with mucoid impac-\\ntion. It occurs in the left upper lobe and is usually\\nasymptomatic. The typical CT findings – a mucocele\\nwith a branching pattern associated with segmental\\nhyperinflation?\\nare not consistent with the CT\\nfindings in this case. Obstructive mucoid impaction\\nmay also be seen in patients with a variety of lung\\ntumors, but no endobronchial masses were noted in\\nthis patient at bronchoscopy.\\nBronchoscopy in patients with pulmonary hydatid\\ndisease may reveal collections of whitish-yellow\\ngelatinous material composed of laminated exocyst\\nmembranes in the bronchi.13,40 Cytologic examina-\\ntion of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid and brushings\\nreveals scolexes or degenerated hooklets in over half\\nthe cases, 40 and cytologic evaluation of a sputum\\nsample can sometimes be diagnostic.41 However, the\\nresults of cytologic examinations were negative in the\\npatient under discussion. The mucoid material seen\\nin this patient was probably a bronchial cast42,43 caused\\nby inflammation or infection or, possibly, by bron-\\nchial compression by the upper-lobe lesion. The di-\\nagnostic procedure may have been a serologic test for\\nE. granulosus-specific antibodies or antigens, cyto-\\nlogic examination of sputum obtained after bron-\\nchoscopy, or possibly, fine-needle aspiration.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nProbable echinococcal cysts.\\nDR.

The\\ncyst was filled with turbid brown fluid and was lined\\nby a tough membrane, 1 mm thick, which lay on but\\nwas not attached to the underlying lung.

Cyst (Top) Surrounded by Atelectatic and Fibrotic\\nLung Tissue and a Scarred Ectatic Bronchus (B) (Hematoxylin\\nand Eosin, ×60).\\nechinococcal cysts as a result of rupture or other\\nmechanisms also occurs, however; in fact, there has\\nbeen one report of the expectoration of an entire\\ncyst.45 Other cysts have become sterile without treat-\\nment. I am not aware of another detailed patholog-\\nical description of a pulmonary echinococcal cyst after\\nalbendazole therapy. Preoperative sterilization of a\\nhepatic hydatid cyst with mebendazole has been re-\\nported, 46 but drug treatment has not destroyed the\\nfertility of the parasite in other cases.47\\nPulmonary echinococcosis can follow intrathorac-\\nic rupture of a hydatid cyst of the liver,48 but most\\npatients with pulmonary hydatid disease do not have\\nliver involvement.13 Within the chest, echinococcosis\\ncan primarily involve the pleural cavity,49 mediasti-\\nnum, 50 and chest wall.51 An echinococcal membrane\\ncan embolize from the liver to the lung.52\\nDR. ZACHARY: The patient took albendazole for\\ntwo weeks postoperatively. She has been well since\\nthat time.\\nDR. KORNFELD: After reviewing the surgical liter-\\nature, I concluded that the risk of the feared com-\\nplication of intraoperative dissemination has been\\nsomewhat overstated. It is important to minimize\\nspillage of the contents of the cyst, but complex sur-\\ngical maneuvers may not be required. Aspiration of\\nthe contents of the cyst with a syringe as well as pre-\\noperative therapy with albendazole may reduce the\\nrisk of this complication.\\n', 'images_used': [], 'answer': 'Based on the patient\\'s presentation and the provided context, the most likely diagnosis is **pulmonary echinococcal cyst**.\\n\\nHere\\'s the reasoning:\\n\\n1.  **Information Gathering:**\\n    *   **Key Signs/Symptoms:** Intermittent cough, hemoptysis, well until 9 months prior, fever, cough with blood, normal physical exam initially, chest radiographs showing well-circumscribed masses in the right lower lobe and left upper lobe.\\n    *   **Duration:** Symptoms present for 9 months.\\n    *   **Epidemiologic Context:** Travel to Georgia and Mexico, exposure to bat guano in New Mexico.\\n    *   **Comorbidities/Medications:** No significant comorbidities or medications mentioned.\\n    *   **Red-Flag Features:** No mention of severe symptoms like shock, AMS, or jaundice.\\n\\n2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\\n    *   **Anatomical System:** Pulmonary system.\\n    *   **Timing/Progression:** Gradual onset of symptoms over 9 months.\\n    *   **Broad Differential:**\\n        *   Infectious: Tuberculosis, fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis), bacterial infections (pneumonia), parasitic infections (cysticercosis, paragonimiasis).\\n        *   Non-infectious: Lung cancer, benign tumors, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener\\'s).\\n    *   **Illness Scripts:**\\n        *   Tuberculosis: Typically presents with more systemic symptoms (weight loss, night sweats), and often has a more chronic course.\\n        *   Fungal infections: Often associated with immunocompromised states.\\n        *   Lung cancer: More common in smokers, and often presents with more persistent symptoms and weight loss.\\n        *   Cysticercosis: Can present with seizures, but also with cough and hemoptysis.\\n        *   Paragonimiasis: Less common in the US, and often associated with consumption of undercooked crustaceans.\\n        *   Pulmonary echinococcosis: Can present with cough, hemoptysis, and chest pain.\\n\\n3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\\n    *   **Defining Features:** Well-circumscribed masses on imaging, hemoptysis, and the patient\\'s travel history to areas where echinococcus is endemic.\\n    *   **Discriminatory Features:** The absence of significant systemic symptoms, the relatively slow progression of symptoms, and the lack of other risk factors for lung cancer.\\n    *   **Point-of-Care Tests/Labs:**\\n        *   Chest X-ray/CT scan: To confirm the presence and characteristics of the masses.\\n        *   Serologic tests for Echinococcus antibodies (IgG and IgA).\\n        *   Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage: To rule out other causes of the masses, such as infection or malignancy.\\n        *   Sputum cytology: To rule out malignancy.\\n    *   **Potential Diagnostic Biases:**\\n        *   Anchoring bias: The initial suspicion of a lung mass may lead to overlooking other possibilities.\\n        *   Availability heuristic: The patient\\'s travel history may lead to overemphasizing the possibility of a parasitic infection.\\n        *   Framing effect: The presentation of the case as a \"pulmonary mass\" may influence the diagnostic process.\\n\\n4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:**\\n    *   The patient\\'s history of travel to endemic areas, the presence of well-circumscribed masses on imaging, and the absence of other significant risk factors make pulmonary echinococcal cyst the most likely diagnosis.\\n    *   The serologic tests for Echinococcus antibodies are crucial for confirming the diagnosis.\\n    *   The patient should be started on albendazole therapy.\\n    *   The patient should be monitored for signs of complications, such as rupture of the cyst or dissemination of the parasite.\\n\\nWORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Pulmonary echinococcal cyst\\nDISEASE_NAME: Echinococcosis\\n', 'original_file': 'NEJM199909233411308.json'}\n",

Be concise and grounded.\\n\\n# PATIENT CASE\\nA 62-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of a foot infection.\\nThe patient\\'s medical history included hypertension, hyperlipoproteinemia, and mild chronic renal failure, with a base-line creatinine level of 2 mg per deciliter (177 µmol per liter). Twelve years before admission, Takayasu\\'s arteritis, severe aortic atherosclerosis, and peripheral vascular disease (central aortic systolic pressure, 130 mm Hg; systolic pressure in each arm, 80 mm Hg) were diagnosed, and prednisone was administered for two years. At approximately the same time, pulmonary hypertension was documented by a catheter study. During the year before the current admission, bilateral carotid artery disease was treated by endarterectomies. The patient had severe stenosis of the left renal artery, mild stenosis of the right renal artery, and bilateral iliac artery disease, with poor circulation in the legs. She also had a history of cardiomyopathy, with moderate mitral regurgitation, congestive heart failure, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 percent but without notable coronary disease or stenosis of the coronary ostia.\\nFive months before admission, a cerebral aneurysm was treated by coil embolization through a right femoral catheter, and infection developed at the site of catheterization. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the tip of the catheter and from a blood specimen. Multiple skin lesions on the patient\\'s right leg and foot were considered to be consistent with the presence of either cholesterol or septic emboli. The administration of vancomycin was complicated by the development of the red man syndrome (profound hypotension and a maculopapular rash after overly rapid administration of the drug). Because the patient had an allergy to penicillin, hyposensitization to nafcillin was attempted, but an allergic reaction with erythroderma occurred.\\nDuring the next six weeks, the patient received prolonged intravenous infusions of vancomycin, with repeated doses of hydroxyzine hydrochloride to help manage the erythroderma. Her skin became diffusely tender, and there was persistent pain in her right foot and ankle. On the 48th hospital day, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility, where vancomycin infusions were continued for 5 weeks and then stopped because the rash worsened and eosinophilia developed. The pain in the right foot persisted, although repeated examinations showed no abnormalities.\\nTwo months before the current admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital because of low-grade fever. No evidence of infection was found. The fever resolved, and she was discharged. During the month before the current admission, the pain in the right heel and ankle worsened and began to radiate up the shin. Noninvasive vascular studies showed satisfactory arterial flow to the feet. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the pelvis, obtained elsewhere after the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed no abnormalities. The results of a physical examination performed nine days before the current admission were normal.\\nOne week before admission, the patient\\'s temperature rose to 38.9°C, without chills. Three days later, the lateral aspect of the right ankle became swollen. On the day of admission, examination showed marked swelling and tenderness around the ankle. Aspiration of the subtalar joint yielded sanguinopurulent fluid. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\\nThe temperature was 37.9°C, the pulse was 80, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg.\\nThe patient appeared acutely ill. Examination showed that the swelling of the right heel and ankle was more prominent over the lateral than over the medial malleolus, with erythema, warmth, and tenderness. The ankle joint was not painful during movement to a 45° angle; pain was noted on movement of the subtalar joint.\\nThe urine was positive (++) for protein but was otherwise normal. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 94, with minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities; the tracing was unchanged from one obtained four months earlier. Radiographs of the chest revealed a normal heart, clear lungs, focal aortic calcification, and osteoporotic bones. Films of the right ankle (Fig. 1) showed prominent soft-tissue swelling adjacent to the ankle joint, a joint effusion, focal demineralization of the distal fibula and posterior calcaneus, and narrowing of the joint space. The joint fluid was viscous and contained 243,000 white cells per cubic millimeter; the differential count was 86 percent neutrophils, 1 percent lymphocytes, and 13 percent nonhematic cells. Microscopical examination of a stained specimen revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters.\\nSpecimens of blood and joint fluid were obtained for culture. Vancomycin was infused, and treatment with hydroxyzine hydrochloride was continued. On the second hospital day, the exudates in the calcaneus were incised and drained. Beads impregnated with tobramycin were inserted, and a cast was applied. Culture specimens of the operative area and joint fluid yielded S. aureus that was susceptible to vancomycin and clindamycin and resistant to penicillin G and erythromycin. One blood culture yielded coagulase-negative staphylococci. Examination of a biopsy specimen showed acute and chronic osteomyelitis with osteonecrosis. Mild, diffuse erythroderma recurred during the administration of vancomycin and disappeared gradually after the substitution of ofloxacin and clindamycin. By the fourth hospital day, the patient\\'s temperature was normal.\\nOn the 16th hospital day, a midline catheter was inserted in the right basilic vein for continued administration of antibiotics. That evening, the temperature rose to 39.3°C, after which mild diarrhea developed. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). Thoracic radiographs showed bibasal atelectasis. A stool specimen was positive for Clostridium difficile toxin. Repeated cultures of blood specimens were negative.\\nDuring the next several days, the peak daily temperature ranged from 37.8° to 38.7°C. The diarrhea diminished. On the 21st hospital day, examination of the right foot showed new microembolic lesions on the second, third, and fifth toes. A transthoracic cardiac ultrasonographic study revealed an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 60 percent and mild mitral regurgitation; no valvular vegetations were detected. A CT scan of the abdomen, pelvis, and upper legs (Fig. 2), obtained without the injection of contrast material, showed focal dilatation of the right common femoral artery to a diameter of 1.5 cm at the level of the femoral head.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. JEFFREY M. SLAIBY*: This 62-year-old woman presented with sepsis of the ankle joint and osteomyelitis five months after undergoing percutaneous coil embolization of a cerebral aneurysm. May we review the radiologic findings?\\nDR. CHIEH-MIN FAN: The films of the right ankle and foot (Fig. 1) show focal demineralization in the posterior calcaneus and distal fibula, with a joint effusion. The oblique and frontal views show marked soft-tissue swelling along the lateral aspect of the ankle. There is narrowing of the joint space, especially along the medial aspect of the joint. These findings are characteristic of an inflammatory arthropathy.\\nThe CT scan of the pelvis (Fig. 2), obtained without the administration of contrast material, shows obliteration of the fat planes between the right external iliac artery and vein, a finding consistent with the presence of edema or inflammation. More distally, there is focal aneurysmal dilatation of the right common femoral artery, with blurring of the fat plane anterior to it.\\nDR. SLAIBY: Septic arthritis is a disabling condition, especially in the elderly and in persons with preexisting arthritis. Risk factors for septic arthritis include joint disease, especially rheumatoid arthritis; traumatic or iatrogenic penetration of the joint; intravenous drug abuse; and an impaired host defense due to cancer, corticosteroid use, diabetes, or advanced age.\\nSeptic arthritis most commonly results from the hematogenous spread of a distant infection. The initial site of infection is usually the urinary tract or skin, and skin infection may result from intravenous drug use. Synovial tissue is highly vascular and lacks a basement membrane, making it very susceptible to bacterial seeding. Septic arthritis complicates arthroscopy and open-joint surgery in less than 1 percent of cases. Patients with preexisting arthritis who receive intraarticular injections are at particularly high risk for joint infection both through direct inoculation and through seeding during bacteremia. Septic arthritis can also be caused by the spread of bacteria from adjacent areas of osteomyelitis or from contiguous soft-tissue infection, such as cellulitis, septic bursitis, or infectious tenosynovitis.\\nSeveral features of this patient\\'s illness may have been related to the development of right subtalar septic arthritis and osteomyelitis of the calcaneus. Five months earlier, she had S. aureus bacteremia and lesions on her right leg and foot that suggested either septic or cholesterol embolism. Antibiotic treatment of the bacteremia was complicated by an allergic reaction to nafcillin and the development of erythroderma after prolonged treatment with vancomycin. Either of these responses could have led to infection of the soft tissue in the foot, with spread to the adjacent ankle joint.\\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae was widely accepted as the most common cause of septic arthritis until studies suggested that S. aureus is more often involved. In one study, 64 percent of patients with septic arthritis had cultures that were positive for S. aureus; 39 percent of the S. aureus isolates were resistant to methicillin. Other organisms involved in septic arthritis are streptococci and gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli and pseudomonas. Gramnegative organisms tend to be isolated most frequently from intravenous drug abusers and elderly, debilitated patients.\\nAlthough bacteremia is the most common cause of septic arthritis, the joint infection is usually monarticular. Polyarticular involvement is unusual and occurs most often in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In patients with polyarticular septic arthritis, as in those with monarticular septic arthritis, the most common infectious agent is S. aureus. The knee is affected most frequently, followed by the hip and shoulder; involvement of the wrist, ankle, or elbow is uncommon.\\nOne of the most important steps in the diagnosis of septic arthritis is the aspiration of joint fluid, with the performance of a cell count and a differential count, microscopical evaluation of the fluid, and measurement of the protein and glucose levels. Blood cultures should be performed for anaerobic and aerobic bacteria and, if clinically suspected, fungi and mycobacteria. Blood cultures are positive in up to a third of patients with bacterial septic arthritis. Plain films should be obtained before aspiration of the joint space. Early in the course of septic arthritis, the films may reveal a nonspecific effusion or widening of the joint space. Later, erosion of the subchondral bone, periarticular osteopenia, and narrowing of the joint space may occur. As in this case, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated in cases of septic arthritis, and this feature may help differentiate the disease from rheumatoid arthritis. The radiologic and pathological features of this case, including the osteopenia and narrowing of the joint space, suggest the chronic nature of the joint-space infection.\\nTakayasu\\'s arteritis is an inflammatory and obliterative disease of large and medium-size arteries that predominantly affects the aorta and its branches. Typically, the disease has two stages. The first is an acute, systemic illness characterized by fever, weakness, arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, and pain in the chest and abdomen. This is followed by an occlusive stage characterized by the absence of pulses and by symptoms of end-organ ischemia. Stenotic vascular lesions occur in 98 percent of patients with Takayasu\\'s arteritis, and aneurysms are present in 27 percent. Systemic manifestations include renal hypertension, with bilateral renal-artery involvement in up to half the cases, and symptoms of coronary artery disease, aortic-valve involvement, myocarditis, and pericarditis.\\nMany patients have cerebrovascular disease, with either transient ischemic attacks or cerebrovascular accidents, as a result of uncontrolled hypertension or occlusion of the carotid or brachiocephalic arteries. Muscle and joint symptoms occur in approximately half the patients; these symptoms have been associated with rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Several features of this case are consistent with the diagnosis of Takayasu\\'s arteritis, with evidence of occlusive disease of the aorta and its major branches and renovascular disease.\\nOsler was the first to use the term \"mycotic aneurysm\" to designate an aneurysm that resembled a fungal growth and resulted from infection in a vessel wall after embolism from the heart. The term has persisted, although “infected aneurysm” is more accurate and is now used more often. Infected aneurysms include both false aneurysms (pseudoaneurysms) caused by infection and true aneurysms that have become secondarily infected. Infected aneurysms have been found in only 0.4 percent of patients at autopsy. Only 3 percent of abdominal aortic aneurysms are infected at the time of clinical presentation.\\nIn the era before antibiotics were available, infected aneurysms were usually a complication of untreated bacterial endocarditis, and evidence of embolism was detected in about 80 percent of cases. Bacterial endocarditis remains a source of bacteria or infected microemboli that lodge in either the vasa vasorum or the lumen of an artery, causing a local arteritis. Necrosis of the vessel wall, aneurysmal dilatation, or rupture can follow singly or in combination. Patients with atherosclerotic vessels are at increased risk for the development of an infected aneurysm, which may arise from bacterial endocarditis, an adjacent infection (such as appendicitis), or infectious seeding from a preexisting aneurysm; seeding accounts for 3 percent of infected aneurysms. Another cause is infectious contamination from local trauma due to percutaneous puncture and angiography, invasive hemodynamic monitoring, or self-injection of drugs. S. aureus and salmonella species account for most infected aneurysms with a bacterial cause.\\nVarious imaging techniques are available for the evaluation of vascular infections. Ultrasound examination with color-flow imaging is useful in evaluating a pulsatile mass by differentiating among a fluid collection, a solid mass, and flowing arterial blood. Contrast-enhanced CT scanning has a sensitivity of 57 percent and a specificity of 100 percent for the diagnosis of arterial-graft infection when the diagnostic criteria include localized vessel dilatation with minimal calcification, an abnormal collection of fluid or air around the vessel wall, and an encasing mass. When indium-111-labeled leukocytes or indium-111-labeled immune globulin is used in scanning, the tracer accumulates at sites of inflammation or infection, yielding a sensitivity of 91 to 100 percent and a specificity of 87 to 100 percent for the diagnosis of vascular-graft infection.\\nThe patient under discussion had a second episode of embolization, to the second, third, and fifth toes of the right foot, on the 21st hospital day — more than 5 months after the initial embolic event. Distal embolization and septic arthritis of the ankle, taken together, strongly suggest the presence of an infected aneurysm. The CT scan of the abdomen and the upper legs (to the knees), obtained on admission, showed focal dilatation of the right common femoral artery, which was not visible on a scan obtained during the month before admission. This finding is consistent with the presence of a pseudoaneurysm at the site of the percutaneous catheterization. I would have ordered an indium-111-labeled leukocyte scan at this point, since it would have allowed whole-body imaging with an assessment of the femoral artery and other potential sources of infection. Knowing the level of the patient\\'s renal insufficiency, I would have been reluctant to order a contrast-enhanced angiographic study. Ultrasound examination of the femoral artery would have provided more information about the nature of the femoral pseudoaneurysm by indicating whether a thrombus was present and, if so, its extent.\\nFemoral pseudoaneurysms often follow self-injection of drugs. Numerous problems, such as renal damage, a tendency to thrombosis, repeated bouts of sepsis, bacterial endocarditis, chronic venous and lymphatic obstruction, and skin ulcers, occur much more often in drug users than in other patients, making it difficult to compare the outcomes in these two populations.\\nUntreated pseudoaneurysms may become infected, and the infection may result in systemic sepsis, hemorrhage, ischemia requiring amputation of the affected limb, or death. S. aureus is the organism most commonly isolated in these cases. An infected pseudoaneurysm should be treated primarily by ligation and excision, with wide débridement and complete drainage of any associated abscess. The necessity, timing, and extent of subsequent revascularization are controversial. The overall rate of amputation after ligation, with or without revascularization, ranges from 7 to 17 percent. In cases requiring ligation of an infected aneurysm involving the femoral bifurcation, a 33 percent rate of amputation was reported by Reddy, who recommended selective revascularization. Padberg et al. found that patients who underwent revascularization after ligation of a femoral pseudoaneurysm had multiple complications, including hemorrhage, graft infection, and ischemia requiring amputation; in contrast, amputation was not required in patients treated with ligation alone when the postligation viability of the affected limb was confirmed during surgery by the detection of a Doppler signal at the ankle. In this series, revascularization was considered only when the absence of a Doppler signal indicated acute ischemia of the limb. Similarly, Ting and Cheng reported that amputation was not required after treatment with ligation alone in 34 patients with infected femoral pseudoaneurysms.\\nVascular complications of diagnostic angiographic examination, cardiac catheterization, and percutaneous angioplasty include acute arterial occlusion, dissecting aneurysm of the vessel, peripheral embolization, hematoma, and infected pseudoaneurysm. The reported frequency of an infected femoral pseudoaneurysm after diagnostic angiographic examination ranges from 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent. After interventional procedures such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and iliac angioplasty, the frequency ranges from 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent. Septic complications include infective endarteritis manifested by the development of a pseudoaneurysm, bacteremia in the absence of endocarditis, regional septic emboli, or a combination of these findings. In all 18 reported cases of infections of femoral arteries after percutaneous angioplasty, catheterization had been performed repeatedly or a femoralartery sheath had been left in place for one to five days.\\nEndovascular manipulation of stenotic or occluded vessels by balloon angioplasty and metallic-stent placement has led to increased reports of septic complications at the operative site. The causative organism has usually been S. aureus. Symptoms frequently associated with stent infection are fever, pain in the leg, and cutaneous petechiae on the affected limb. In addition, percutaneous arterial puncture has been followed by septic arthritis and osteomyelitis complicated by an infected pseudoaneurysm.\\nA survey of the literature has revealed eight cases in which symptoms of septic arthritis or osteomyelitis developed one to six days after the performance of an endovascular procedure. In one case, the procedure was angioplasty of an iliac-artery lesion; in the other cases, the procedure was coronary angioplasty. The cultured organism was S. aureus in seven cases and group B streptococcus in one case. In seven of the eight cases, the involved site was on the same side as the site of catheterization. In the seven cases in which the site of the joint or bone infection was identified, it was the knee joint in five cases, the elbow joint in one, and the distal tibia in one.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Dr. Isselbacher, you saw this patient before the diagnostic procedure. Will you comment?\\nDR. ERIC ISSELBACHER: The patient was hospitalized several times during the course of her illness. After the initial catheterization procedure, she had pain in her leg that we believed resulted from septic or cholesterol emboli. However, the pain persisted even though the lesions on her shin and foot healed, and she left the hospital with chronic pain in the right foot. The patient\\'s description of the pain was vague, and she was still able to walk on the foot. The pain did not improve for several months, but the first time it became worrisome was when she was admitted to the other hospital with fever. At that time the results of an evaluation for infection or osteomyelitis were negative. On all her outpatient visits before the most recent admission, she reported continued pain in her foot, although there was nothing abnormal about her foot, ankle, or leg, and there were no new lesions.\\nI discussed this case a number of times with a vascular surgeon, and we obtained a CT scan on an outpatient basis to look for an infected pseudoaneurysm. The scan showed no abnormalities. We were worried about the foot and were vigilant, but there were no objective findings that prompted us to intervene until the patient was readmitted with swelling, erythema, and much more severe pain in her foot.\\nDR. MARK: Are there any reports in the literature of a pseudoaneurysm involving the femoral nerve, giving rise to pain or immobility?\\nDR. SLAIBY: I have neither seen a case nor read a report of femoral neuropathy associated with a femoral pseudoaneurysm after catheterization. If the pseudoaneurysm were large enough, however, neuropathy could occur.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nInfective pseudoaneurysm of the right femoral artery after catheterization.\\n\\nDR. JEFFREY M. SLAIBY\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nInfective pseudoaneurysm of the right femoral artery after catheterization.\\nSeptic arthritis.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. FAN: The diagnostic procedure was a study with indium-111-labeled human polyclonal immune globulin (Fig. 3). The dose of tracer that can be given with a white-cell scan is limited by the proximity of the target area to the spleen, which also attracts the labeled white cells. In contrast, indium-111-labeled human polyclonal immune globulin accumulates at sites of inflammation because of increased capillary permeability in these areas. Since the agent does not preferentially accumulate in the spleen, a dose of radionuclide can be administered that is almost four times the dose used with a white-cell scan. In this case, the scan showed a focal area of markedly increased uptake in the right ankle and an area of slightly increased uptake in the right groin.\\nThe patient returned 96 hours after the injection of the radionuclide for delayed imaging. The uptake in the right groin at that time had a linear configuration, suggesting vascular involvement; there was also much greater uptake within the joint. On a gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiogram of the pelvis (Fig. 4), there is an absence of signal in the middle of the right external iliac artery, a finding consistent with the presence of either a long segment of severe stenosis or an occlusion. Surprisingly, the right common femoral region appears to be uninvolved.\\nDR. H. THOMAS ARETZ: After completion of the imaging studies, affected portions of the right external iliac and common femoral arteries were excised, and an obturator bypass was performed.\\nWe received two specimens for pathological examination, one from the right external iliac artery and the other from the right femoral artery. The iliac artery showed generalized aneurysmal dilatation, with multiple areas of disruption of the wall, findings that indicated the presence of a pseudoaneurysm. The lumen was almost completely filled with laminated thrombus. The femoral-artery specimen (Fig. 5) contained a localized saccular aneurysm partially filled with laminated thrombus, with a narrow opening into the arterial lumen (Fig. 6). The wall of this pseudoaneurysm consisted of fibrous tissue (Fig. 7 and 8). Neither aneurysm contained acute inflammatory cells. Gram\\'s stain and fungal stains did not reveal any organisms, and cultures of the specimens were negative. The failure to find organisms was not surprising, since the patient had been treated with antibiotics for several weeks before the surgery was performed. There were focal areas of atherosclerosis in both specimens, but they did not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of the pseudoaneurysms. Also, there was no evidence of Takayasu\\'s arteritis.\\nDR. ARETZ: A specimen of the amputated portion of the leg showed osteomyelitis in the ankle but no evidence of vascular disease.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "Answer: \n",
      "Based on the patient's history, clinical presentation, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is an infective pseudoaneurysm of the right femoral artery, complicated by septic arthritis of the right ankle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Information Gathering:** The patient has a history of multiple vascular procedures, including catheterization, endarterectomy, and a cerebral aneurysm coil embolization. She also has a history of Takayasu's arteritis and pulmonary hypertension. The current presentation includes foot pain, swelling, erythema, and purulent fluid from the ankle joint. Laboratory findings show leukocytosis and a positive urine analysis for protein. Imaging shows a pseudoaneurysm in the right femoral artery and joint effusion with a high white blood cell count in the joint fluid. Gram stain of the joint fluid reveals gram-positive cocci in clusters, consistent with *Staphylococcus aureus*.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\n",
      "    *   **Infective Pseudoaneurysm:** The history of catheterization and the presence of a pseudoaneurysm on imaging strongly suggest this. The location of the pseudoaneurysm in the femoral artery is consistent with the site of the catheterization.\n",
      "    *   **Septic Arthritis:** The purulent joint fluid, elevated white blood cell count in the joint fluid, and the patient's history of prior infections all support this diagnosis. The location of the infection in the ankle joint is also consistent with the patient's symptoms.\n",
      "    *   **Possible *Staphylococcus aureus* Infection:** The Gram stain of the joint fluid showing gram-positive cocci in clusters is highly suggestive of *Staphylococcus aureus*.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
      "    *   **Infective Pseudoaneurysm:** The presence of a pseudoaneurysm on imaging is a key finding. The history of catheterization is a risk factor for pseudoaneurysm formation. The patient's symptoms (pain, swelling, erythema) are consistent with an infected pseudoaneurysm.\n",
      "    *   **Septic Arthritis:** The purulent joint fluid, elevated white blood cell count in the joint fluid, and the patient's history of prior infections all support this diagnosis. The location of the infection in the ankle joint is also consistent with the patient's symptoms.\n",
      "    *   **Ruling out other possibilities:** The negative CT scan of the pelvis and the absence of abnormalities on the electrocardiogram make other diagnoses less likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:** The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an infective pseudoaneurysm of the right femoral artery, complicated by septic arthritis of the right ankle. The most likely cause of the infection is *Staphylococcus aureus*, which was identified in the joint fluid. The patient's history of vascular procedures and prior infections increases the risk of this diagnosis.\n",

      "{'query': 'A 62-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of a foot infection.\\nThe patient\\'s medical history included hypertension, hyperlipoproteinemia, and mild chronic renal failure, with a base-line creatinine level of 2 mg per deciliter (177 µmol per liter). Twelve years before admission, Takayasu\\'s arteritis, severe aortic atherosclerosis, and peripheral vascular disease (central aortic systolic pressure, 130 mm Hg; systolic pressure in each arm, 80 mm Hg) were diagnosed, and prednisone was administered for two years. At approximately the same time, pulmonary hypertension was documented by a catheter study. During the year before the current admission, bilateral carotid artery disease was treated by endarterectomies. The patient had severe stenosis of the left renal artery, mild stenosis of the right renal artery, and bilateral iliac artery disease, with poor circulation in the legs. She also had a history of cardiomyopathy, with moderate mitral regurgitation, congestive heart failure, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 percent but without notable coronary disease or stenosis of the coronary ostia.\\nFive months before admission, a cerebral aneurysm was treated by coil embolization through a right femoral catheter, and infection developed at the site of catheterization. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the tip of the catheter and from a blood specimen. Multiple skin lesions on the patient\\'s right leg and foot were considered to be consistent with the presence of either cholesterol or septic emboli. The administration of vancomycin was complicated by the development of the red man syndrome (profound hypotension and a maculopapular rash after overly rapid administration of the drug). Because the patient had an allergy to penicillin, hyposensitization to nafcillin was attempted, but an allergic reaction with erythroderma occurred.\\nDuring the next six weeks, the patient received prolonged intravenous infusions of vancomycin, with repeated doses of hydroxyzine hydrochloride to help manage the erythroderma. Her skin became diffusely tender, and there was persistent pain in her right foot and ankle. On the 48th hospital day, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility, where vancomycin infusions were continued for 5 weeks and then stopped because the rash worsened and eosinophilia developed. The pain in the right foot persisted, although repeated examinations showed no abnormalities.\\nTwo months before the current admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital because of low-grade fever. No evidence of infection was found. The fever resolved, and she was discharged. During the month before the current admission, the pain in the right heel and ankle worsened and began to radiate up the shin. Noninvasive vascular studies showed satisfactory arterial flow to the feet. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the pelvis, obtained elsewhere after the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed no abnormalities. The results of a physical examination performed nine days before the current admission were normal.\\nOne week before admission, the patient\\'s temperature rose to 38.9°C, without chills. Three days later, the lateral aspect of the right ankle became swollen. On the day of admission, examination showed marked swelling and tenderness around the ankle. Aspiration of the subtalar joint yielded sanguinopurulent fluid. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\\nThe temperature was 37.9°C, the pulse was 80, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg.\\nThe patient appeared acutely ill. Examination showed that the swelling of the right heel and ankle was more prominent over the lateral than over the medial malleolus, with erythema, warmth, and tenderness. The ankle joint was not painful during movement to a 45° angle; pain was noted on movement of the subtalar joint.\\nThe urine was positive (++) for protein but was otherwise normal. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). An electrocardiogram showed a normal rhythm at a rate of 94, with minor, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities; the tracing was unchanged from one obtained four months earlier. Radiographs of the chest revealed a normal heart, clear lungs, focal aortic calcification, and osteoporotic bones. Films of the right ankle (Fig. 1) showed prominent soft-tissue swelling adjacent to the ankle joint, a joint effusion, focal demineralization of the distal fibula and posterior calcaneus, and narrowing of the joint space. The joint fluid was viscous and contained 243,000 white cells per cubic millimeter; the differential count was 86 percent neutrophils, 1 percent lymphocytes, and 13 percent nonhematic cells. Microscopical examination of a stained specimen revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters.\\nSpecimens of blood and joint fluid were obtained for culture. Vancomycin was infused, and treatment with hydroxyzine hydrochloride was continued. On the second hospital day, the exudates in the calcaneus were incised and drained. Beads impregnated with tobramycin were inserted, and a cast was applied. Culture specimens of the operative area and joint fluid yielded S. aureus that was susceptible to vancomycin and clindamycin and resistant to penicillin G and erythromycin. One blood culture yielded coagulase-negative staphylococci. Examination of a biopsy specimen showed acute and chronic osteomyelitis with osteonecrosis. Mild, diffuse erythroderma recurred during the administration of vancomycin and disappeared gradually after the substitution of ofloxacin and clindamycin. By the fourth hospital day, the patient\\'s temperature was normal.\\nOn the 16th hospital day, a midline catheter was inserted in the right basilic vein for continued administration of antibiotics. That evening, the temperature rose to 39.3°C, after which mild diarrhea developed. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2). Thoracic radiographs showed bibasal atelectasis. A stool specimen was positive for Clostridium difficile toxin. Repeated cultures of blood specimens were negative.\\nDuring the next several days, the peak daily temperature ranged from 37.8° to 38.7°C. The diarrhea diminished. On the 21st hospital day, examination of the right foot showed new microembolic lesions on the second, third, and fifth toes. A transthoracic cardiac ultrasonographic study revealed an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 60 percent and mild mitral regurgitation; no valvular vegetations were detected. A CT scan of the abdomen, pelvis, and upper legs (Fig. 2), obtained without the injection of contrast material, showed focal dilatation of the right common femoral artery to a diameter of 1.5 cm at the level of the femoral head.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. JEFFREY M. SLAIBY*: This 62-year-old woman presented with sepsis of the ankle joint and osteomyelitis five months after undergoing percutaneous coil embolization of a cerebral aneurysm. May we review the radiologic findings?\\nDR. CHIEH-MIN FAN: The films of the right ankle and foot (Fig. 1) show focal demineralization in the posterior calcaneus and distal fibula, with a joint effusion. The oblique and frontal views show marked soft-tissue swelling along the lateral aspect of the ankle. There is narrowing of the joint space, especially along the medial aspect of the joint. These findings are characteristic of an inflammatory arthropathy.\\nThe CT scan of the pelvis (Fig. 2), obtained without the administration of contrast material, shows obliteration of the fat planes between the right external iliac artery and vein, a finding consistent with the presence of edema or inflammation. More distally, there is focal aneurysmal dilatation of the right common femoral artery, with blurring of the fat plane anterior to it.\\nDR. SLAIBY: Septic arthritis is a disabling condition, especially in the elderly and in persons with preexisting arthritis. Risk factors for septic arthritis include joint disease, especially rheumatoid arthritis; traumatic or iatrogenic penetration of the joint; intravenous drug abuse; and an impaired host defense due to cancer, corticosteroid use, diabetes, or advanced age.\\nSeptic arthritis most commonly results from the hematogenous spread of a distant infection. The initial site of infection is usually the urinary tract or skin, and skin infection may result from intravenous drug use. Synovial tissue is highly vascular and lacks a basement membrane, making it very susceptible to bacterial seeding. Septic arthritis complicates arthroscopy and open-joint surgery in less than 1 percent of cases. Patients with preexisting arthritis who receive intraarticular injections are at particularly high risk for joint infection both through direct inoculation and through seeding during bacteremia. Septic arthritis can also be caused by the spread of bacteria from adjacent areas of osteomyelitis or from contiguous soft-tissue infection, such as cellulitis, septic bursitis, or infectious tenosynovitis.\\nSeveral features of this patient\\'s illness may have been related to the development of right subtalar septic arthritis and osteomyelitis of the calcaneus. Five months earlier, she had S. aureus bacteremia and lesions on her right leg and foot that suggested either septic or cholesterol embolism. Antibiotic treatment of the bacteremia was complicated by an allergic reaction to nafcillin and the development of erythroderma after prolonged treatment with vancomycin. Either of these responses could have led to infection of the soft tissue in the foot, with spread to the adjacent ankle joint.\\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae was widely accepted as the most common cause of septic arthritis until studies suggested that S. aureus is more often involved. In one study, 64 percent of patients with septic arthritis had cultures that were positive for S. aureus; 39 percent of the S. aureus isolates were resistant to methicillin. Other organisms involved in septic arthritis are streptococci and gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli and pseudomonas. Gramnegative organisms tend to be isolated most frequently from intravenous drug abusers and elderly, debilitated patients.\\nAlthough bacteremia is the most common cause of septic arthritis, the joint infection is usually monarticular. Polyarticular involvement is unusual and occurs most often in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In patients with polyarticular septic arthritis, as in those with monarticular septic arthritis, the most common infectious agent is S. aureus. The knee is affected most frequently, followed by the hip and shoulder; involvement of the wrist, ankle, or elbow is uncommon.\\nOne of the most important steps in the diagnosis of septic arthritis is the aspiration of joint fluid, with the performance of a cell count and a differential count, microscopical evaluation of the fluid, and measurement of the protein and glucose levels. Blood cultures should be performed for anaerobic and aerobic bacteria and, if clinically suspected, fungi and mycobacteria. Blood cultures are positive in up to a third of patients with bacterial septic arthritis. Plain films should be obtained before aspiration of the joint space. Early in the course of septic arthritis, the films may reveal a nonspecific effusion or widening of the joint space. Later, erosion of the subchondral bone, periarticular osteopenia, and narrowing of the joint space may occur. As in this case, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated in cases of septic arthritis, and this feature may help differentiate the disease from rheumatoid arthritis. The radiologic and pathological features of this case, including the osteopenia and narrowing of the joint space, suggest the chronic nature of the joint-space infection.\\nTakayasu\\'s arteritis is an inflammatory and obliterative disease of large and medium-size arteries that predominantly affects the aorta and its branches. Typically, the disease has two stages. The first is an acute, systemic illness characterized by fever, weakness, arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, and pain in the chest and abdomen. This is followed by an occlusive stage characterized by the absence of pulses and by symptoms of end-organ ischemia.

Muscle and joint symptoms occur in approximately half the patients; these symptoms have been associated with rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Several features of this case are consistent with the diagnosis of Takayasu\\'s arteritis, with evidence of occlusive disease of the aorta and its major branches and renovascular disease.\\nOsler was the first to use the term \"mycotic aneurysm\" to designate an aneurysm that resembled a fungal growth and resulted from infection in a vessel wall after embolism from the heart.

The reported frequency of an infected femoral pseudoaneurysm after diagnostic angiographic examination ranges from 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent. After interventional procedures such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and iliac angioplasty, the frequency ranges from 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent. Septic complications include infective endarteritis manifested by the development of a pseudoaneurysm, bacteremia in the absence of endocarditis, regional septic emboli, or a combination of these findings. In all 18 reported cases of infections of femoral arteries after percutaneous angioplasty, catheterization had been performed repeatedly or a femoralartery sheath had been left in place for one to five days.\\nEndovascular manipulation of stenotic or occluded vessels by balloon angioplasty and metallic-stent placement has led to increased reports of septic complications at the operative site. The causative organism has usually been S. aureus. Symptoms frequently associated with stent infection are fever, pain in the leg, and cutaneous petechiae on the affected limb. In addition, percutaneous arterial puncture has been followed by septic arthritis and osteomyelitis complicated by an infected pseudoaneurysm.\\nA survey of the literature has revealed eight cases in which symptoms of septic arthritis or osteomyelitis developed one to six days after the performance of an endovascular procedure. In one case, the procedure was angioplasty of an iliac-artery lesion; in the other cases, the procedure was coronary angioplasty. The cultured organism was S. aureus in seven cases and group B streptococcus in one case. In seven of the eight cases, the involved site was on the same side as the site of catheterization. In the seven cases in which the site of the joint or bone infection was identified, it was the knee joint in five cases, the elbow joint in one, and the distal tibia in one.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Dr. Isselbacher, you saw this patient before the diagnostic procedure. Will you comment?\\nDR. ERIC ISSELBACHER: The patient was hospitalized several times during the course of her illness. After the initial catheterization procedure, she had pain in her leg that we believed resulted from septic or cholesterol emboli. However, the pain persisted even though the lesions on her shin and foot healed, and she left the hospital with chronic pain in the right foot. The patient\\'s description of the pain was vague, and she was still able to walk on the foot. The pain did not improve for several months, but the first time it became worrisome was when she was admitted to the other hospital with fever. At that time the results of an evaluation for infection or osteomyelitis were negative. On all her outpatient visits before the most recent admission, she reported continued pain in her foot, although there was nothing abnormal about her foot, ankle, or leg, and there were no new lesions.\\nI discussed this case a number of times with a vascular surgeon, and we obtained a CT scan on an outpatient basis to look for an infected pseudoaneurysm. The scan showed no abnormalities. We were worried about the foot and were vigilant, but there were no objective findings that prompted us to intervene until the patient was readmitted with swelling, erythema, and much more severe pain in her foot.\\nDR. MARK: Are there any reports in the literature of a pseudoaneurysm involving the femoral nerve, giving rise to pain or immobility?\\nDR. SLAIBY: I have neither seen a case nor read a report of femoral neuropathy associated with a femoral pseudoaneurysm after catheterization. If the pseudoaneurysm were large enough, however, neuropathy could occur.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nInfective pseudoaneurysm of the right femoral artery after catheterization.\\n\\nDR. JEFFREY M. SLAIBY\\'S DIAGNOSES\\nInfective pseudoaneurysm of the right femoral artery after catheterization.\\nSeptic arthritis.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. FAN: The diagnostic procedure was a study with indium-111-labeled human polyclonal immune globulin (Fig. 3). The dose of tracer that can be given with a white-cell scan is limited by the proximity of the target area to the spleen, which also attracts the labeled white cells. In contrast, indium-111-labeled human polyclonal immune globulin accumulates at sites of inflammation because of increased capillary permeability in these areas. Since the agent does not preferentially accumulate in the spleen, a dose of radionuclide can be administered that is almost four times the dose used with a white-cell scan. In this case, the scan showed a focal area of markedly increased uptake in the right ankle and an area of slightly increased uptake in the right groin.\\nThe patient returned 96 hours after the injection of the radionuclide for delayed imaging. The uptake in the right groin at that time had a linear configuration, suggesting vascular involvement; there was also much greater uptake within the joint. On a gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiogram of the pelvis (Fig. 4), there is an absence of signal in the middle of the right external iliac artery, a finding consistent with the presence of either a long segment of severe stenosis or an occlusion. Surprisingly, the right common femoral region appears to be uninvolved.\\nDR. H. THOMAS ARETZ: After completion of the imaging studies, affected portions of the right external iliac and common femoral arteries were excised, and an obturator bypass was performed.\\nWe received two specimens for pathological examination, one from the right external iliac artery and the other from the right femoral artery. The iliac artery showed generalized aneurysmal dilatation, with multiple areas of disruption of the wall, findings that indicated the presence of a pseudoaneurysm. The lumen was almost completely filled with laminated thrombus. The femoral-artery specimen (Fig. 5) contained a localized saccular aneurysm partially filled with laminated thrombus, with a narrow opening into the arterial lumen (Fig. 6). The wall of this pseudoaneurysm consisted of fibrous tissue (Fig. 7 and 8). Neither aneurysm contained acute inflammatory cells. Gram\\'s stain and fungal stains did not reveal any organisms, and cultures of the specimens were negative. The failure to find organisms was not surprising, since the patient had been treated with antibiotics for several weeks before the surgery was performed. There were focal areas of atherosclerosis in both specimens, but they did not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of the pseudoaneurysms. Also, there was no evidence of Takayasu\\'s arteritis.\\nDR. ARETZ: A specimen of the amputated portion of the leg showed osteomyelitis in the ankle but no evidence of vascular disease.', 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"Based on the patient's history, clinical presentation, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is an infective pseudoaneurysm of the right femoral artery, complicated by septic arthritis of the right ankle.\\n\\nHere's the reasoning:\\n\\n1.  **Information Gathering:** The patient has a history of multiple vascular procedures, including catheterization, endarterectomy, and a cerebral aneurysm coil embolization. She also has a history of Takayasu's arteritis and pulmonary hypertension. The current presentation includes foot pain, swelling, erythema, and purulent fluid from the ankle joint. Laboratory findings show leukocytosis and a positive urine analysis for protein. Imaging shows a pseudoaneurysm in the right femoral artery and joint effusion with a high white blood cell count in the joint fluid. Gram stain of the joint fluid reveals gram-positive cocci in clusters, consistent with *Staphylococcus aureus*.\\n\\n2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\\n    *   **Infective Pseudoaneurysm:** The history of catheterization and the presence of a pseudoaneurysm on imaging strongly suggest this. The location of the pseudoaneurysm in the femoral artery is consistent with the site of the catheterization.\\n    *   **Septic Arthritis:** The purulent joint fluid, elevated white blood cell count in the joint fluid, and the patient's history of prior infections all support this diagnosis. The location of the infection in the ankle joint is also consistent with the patient's symptoms.\\n    *   **Possible *Staphylococcus aureus* Infection:** The Gram stain of the joint fluid showing gram-positive cocci in clusters is highly suggestive of *Staphylococcus aureus*.\\n\\n3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\\n    *   **Infective Pseudoaneurysm:** The presence of a pseudoaneurysm on imaging is a key finding. The history of catheterization is a risk factor for pseudoaneurysm formation. The patient's symptoms (pain, swelling, erythema) are consistent with an infected pseudoaneurysm.\\n    *   **Septic Arthritis:** The purulent joint fluid, elevated white blood cell count in the joint fluid, and the patient's history of prior infections all support this diagnosis. The location of the infection in the ankle joint is also consistent with the patient's symptoms.\\n    *   **Ruling out other possibilities:** The negative CT scan of the pelvis and the absence of abnormalities on the electrocardiogram make other diagnoses less likely.\\n\\n4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:** The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an infective pseudoaneurysm of the right femoral artery, complicated by septic arthritis of the right ankle. The most likely cause of the infection is *Staphylococcus aureus*, which was identified in the joint fluid. The patient's history of vascular procedures and prior infections increases the risk of this diagnosis.\\n\\nWORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Infective pseudoaneurysm of the right femoral artery, complicated by septic arthritis of the right ankle.\\nDISEASE_NAME: Infective pseudoaneurysm\\n\", 'original_file': 'NEJM199912163412508.json'}\n",

The presence of H. capsulatum in the blood and cultures strongly points to histoplasmosis.\\n*   **Timing:** The patient's history of being from Alabama suggests a possible reactivation of a latent infection. The acute presentation with septic shock suggests an active, aggressive infection.\\n\\n3) Hypothesis Testing:\\n*   **Defining Features:** The presence of H. capsulatum in the blood and cultures, along with the clinical presentation, are key. The pseudocapsule is characteristic of H. capsulatum.\\n*   **Discriminatory Features:** The patient's AIDS status and history of being from Alabama are important. The failure of amphotericin B is also relevant.\\n*   **Tests:** The peripheral blood smear showing the characteristic yeast-like organisms is diagnostic. Blood cultures are essential to confirm the presence of H. capsulatum.\\n*   **Biases:** The patient's AIDS status might lead to a focus on opportunistic infections. The history of being from Alabama might lead to overlooking other potential causes.\\n\\n4) Reflection & Final Diagnosis:\\nThe patient's presentation, including the presence of H. capsulatum in the blood, the clinical symptoms, and the history of being from Alabama, strongly suggest histoplasmosis. The failure of amphotericin B is concerning and may indicate a more aggressive form of the disease or drug resistance. The patient's AIDS status makes him more susceptible to opportunistic infections.\\n\\nWORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Histoplasmosis, severe, with septic shock.\\nDISEASE_NAME: Histoplasmosis\\n\", 'original_file': 'NEJM200001063420105.json'}\n",

Be concise and grounded.\\n\\n# PATIENT CASE\\nA 35-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of a painful abdominal mass and fever.\\nThe patient was a native of West Africa who had traveled to the United States several times during the previous three years. He had been generally well except for an episode of typhoid fever five years before admission and multiple bouts of malaria over a number of years; the most recent bout occurred three months before admission. Thirty days before admission, he returned to this country. Three or four days later, fever developed, and his temperature rose to 39.4°C, with shaking chills and a vague headache, followed by constant pain in the left lower abdominal quadrant. Suspecting recurrent malaria, he began to take sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and acetaminophen, but the pain worsened after another week, and he consulted a physician. A stool examination revealed no ova or other evidence of intestinal parasites; blood smears were negative for malaria. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen showed extensive abdominal lymphadenopathy, with thickening of the wall of the adjacent small bowel.\\nThe patient had no knowledge of a previous tuberculin skin test or of a test for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). He was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient had initially been a farmer but more recently had worked as a teacher. He had had unprotected heterosexual intercourse once five years before admission. His appetite was reduced, and he had lost 10 kg in weight during his illness. He did not have a history of use of alcohol or recreational drugs, tuberculosis or exposure to it, night sweats, cough, hemoptysis, homosexual intercourse, venereal infection, or use of non-Western medicine.\\nThe temperature was 37°C, the pulse was 80, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg.\\nOn physical examination, the patient appeared well. Palpation revealed shotty submental, cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes, which had reportedly been palpable for many years. No thrush was seen. The lungs were clear. A grade 2 systolic murmur was heard at the left sternal border and apex. On abdominal examination, a vaguely outlined, firm mass, 8 cm in diameter, was palpated to the left of the umbilicus; it was immobile, tender, and lobulated. A stool specimen was negative for occult blood.\\nThe urine was positive (+) for urobilinogen and positive (trace) for protein. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2).\\nA radiograph of the chest (Fig. 1) showed no abnormalities. A CT scan of the abdomen (Fig. 2) showed multiple, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, several of which had centers of low attenuation. There was mild-to-moderate thickening of the wall of the small bowel but without evidence of obstruction.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. JOHANNA P. DAILY*: May we review the imaging studies?\\nDR. RONALD S. ARELLANO: The film of the chest (Fig. 1) shows no abnormalities. The abdominal CT scan obtained at this hospital (Fig. 2) shows enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, many of which have central areas of low attenuation. There is slight thickening of the small-bowel wall but without evidence of obstruction. The liver, spleen, pancreas, and genitourinary system appear normal.\\nDR. DAILY: It is critical to rule out life-threatening infections in a febrile person who has lived or traveled in the tropics. Malaria, typhoid fever, meningococcal infection, rickettsial disease, and hemorrhagic fever, among other infections, require timely diagnosis and treatment. Travelers should be questioned about exposure to animals and bodies of water, the quality of their water and food, and ingestion of unpasteurized products. Vaccination and prophylaxis against malaria may alter the differential diagnosis, although malaria can develop despite prophylaxis. Finally, the prevalence of a disease among persons who travel to the tropics may differ from the prevalence among residents of the tropics, who have a longer period of exposure. This patient had lived in West Africa most of his life, and we can assume that he had been exposed to tuberculosis, which remains endemic in many parts of Africa. He became febrile shortly after his return from the tropics, and his initial nonspecific symptoms are consistent with the presence of malaria. If a person with such symptoms remains febrile, blood cultures should be performed to rule out bacteremia, and blood smears for malaria should be repeated.\\nThe diagnosis is particularly challenging in patients from the tropics, since they may be infected with multiple pathogens. Many of these agents are rarely or never found outside the tropics. Coinfection with HIV, which may alter or accelerate the course of concomitant diseases, should be considered in this case because of the high prevalence of HIV infection in parts of Africa. It has been estimated that more than 20 million HIV-infected people live on the African continent.¹ Until recently, the rates of HIV infection were lower in West Africa than in other parts of Africa, where an estimated 25 percent of the adult population is infected. However, infection rates have been increasing in West Africa; in parts of Nigeria, for example, an estimated 4.1 percent of adults are infected.2\\nThe most striking feature of this patient's illness is the extensive abdominal lymphadenopathy. Before focusing on the differential diagnosis, I shall consider the possibility of concomitant disease, which is suggested by the lymphopenia and chronic, diffuse, shotty lymphadenopathy, and its relation to the illness for which the patient sought medical care.\\nMany disorders can result in lymphopenia. In a study that antedated the HIV epidemic, a review of 178 cases of lymphopenia (defined as a lymphocyte count of less than 1000 per cubic millimeter) showed that the most common underlying disease was cancer (in 42 percent of cases), primarily colon cancer or lymphoma, for which some patients were receiving cytotoxic or radiation therapy. No underlying disease was detected in 22 percent of the patients. Infections and collagen vascular diseases were encountered less frequently than cancer. Tuberculosis can sometimes result in marked lymphopenia, with a specific decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In three patients with active tuberculosis and lymphocyte counts of less than 900 per cubic millimeter, the lymphopenia resolved completely after the administration of antituberculosis therapy alone.4 These patients had negative serologic tests for HIV type 1 (HIV-1), HIV type 2 (HIV-2), and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I); both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were low, with the preservation of a normal ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells. In contrast, in patients with HIV infection, this ratio becomes inverted.\\nThe profound lymphopenia in this patient suggests the presence of HIV-1 infection, which is the most prevalent retrovirus in parts of West Africa, such as Nigeria. Other retroviruses predominate in other areas.5 For example, HIV-2 is the predominant strain in areas of Guinea-Bissau. HIV-1 group O is found primarily in West Africa, but its prevalence is low, and unlike other HIV-1 groups and HIV-2, it is not detected with standard assays. HIV-1 group O infection also results in a reduced number of CD4+ T cells and the development of opportunistic infections. Specialized testing is required to identify this group of viruses.5\\nThe natural history and complications of HIV-1 infection have been studied extensively in Western countries, but much less is known about those aspects of HIV infection in tropical areas. In a study of HIV-infected patients in rural Uganda, the wasting syndrome was the most common manifestation of late-stage disease (in 46 percent of patients), followed by esophageal candidiasis (in 33 percent), chronic herpes simplex virus infection (in 13 percent), and Kaposi's sarcoma (in 13 percent).7 Other studies have shown a strong association between HIV infection and tuberculosis, probably because of the high prevalence of tuberculosis in Africa. 8,9 Patients who have tuberculosis alone may present with a wasting disease, and antituberculosis therapy is often given to such patients.10 In a prospective study of abdominal pain in patients in South Africa who had HIV infection and a CD4+ T-cell count of less than 200 per cubic millimeter, 11 disseminated tuberculosis was diagnosed most frequently (in 32 percent of the patients). Abdominal lymphadenopathy, ascites, and abscesses were strongly associated with tuberculosis. Most of the patients did not have other coexisting opportunistic infections; only 5 percent had atypical mycobacterial infection. In Africa, unlike the United States and Europe, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia has only rarely been reported as a complication of HIV infection.7\\nInfection with HIV-2, which is found predominantly in West Africa, may also result in lymphopenia. HIV-2 infection causes a slower depletion of CD4+ T cells than does HIV-1 infection, with less effect on morbidity and mortality.12,13 In some studies, however, HIV-2 infection has been closely associated with active tuberculosis and the opportunistic infections to which hospitalized patients are susceptible.9,14\\nAlthough it is unclear whether this patient's chronic generalized, peripheral, shotty lymphadenopathy was caused by a pathologic process, infection with HIV-1, HIV-2, or HTLV-I could account for this finding. Patients infected with HTLV-I are typically asymptomatic, but in rare cases, the virus results in leukemia, lymphoma, or tropical spastic paraparesis.15 In Africa, its seroprevalence rates vary widely according to the region. The prevalence in adults is estimated to range from 0.5 to 1 percent in most African countries and up to 12 percent in specific locations in West Africa. In one very small, population-based cohort study in West Africa, HTLV-I infection did not affect survival during a follow-up period of six years.16\\nOther causes of peripheral lymphadenopathy in West Africa, reported before the HIV epidemic began, include reactive hyperplasia, metastatic cancer, lymphoma, tuberculosis, and toxoplasmosis; Hodgkin's disease and filarial granulomas have also been reported.17 One of the most common extrapulmonary manifestations of tuberculosis is peripheral lymphadenopathy.\\nHIV infection is associated with an increase in cases of active tuberculosis and, in some parts of the world, with increased lymph-node involvement.18 To assess the effect of the HIV epidemic on superficial lymph nodes, a study conducted in Lusaka, Zambia, reviewed the histologic findings in specimens from all lymph-node biopsies performed in 1981, as compared with those performed in 1990; in addition, a cohort of patients undergoing lymph-node biopsy in 1990 was tested for HIV infection.19 The 1990 specimens were much more likely than the 1981 specimens to show evidence of tuberculous lymphadenitis, and in the group of patients who underwent HIV testing, 88 percent of those with tuberculous lymphadenitis had positive tests. Also, findings suggestive of the diagnoses of HIV lymphadenopathy and Kaposi's sarcoma of the lymph nodes were more common in 1990 than in 1981.\\nThe most striking finding in this patient is marked abdominal lymphadenopathy, which is probably due to either cancer or infection. If the correct diagnosis is cancer, the extensive lymphadenopathy and the absence of evidence of a primary tumor elsewhere suggest either lymphoma or Kaposi's sarcoma. In a review of cases of lymphoma reported between 1979 and 1988 in Nigeria, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma accounted for 68 and 32 percent of the cases, respectively. Painless peripheral lymphadenopathy, particularly involving the cervical lymph nodes, was the most frequent clinical presentation. Burkitt's lymphoma was diagnosed primarily in children, who typically presented with an abdominal or pelvic tumor.20 In another study from Nigeria, Burkitt's lymphoma was the most common diagnosis, followed by lymphosarcoma, leukemia, and Hodgkin's disease. 21 Burkitt's lymphoma was originally described in African children who presented with large facial tumors. It is an aggressive tumor of B-cell lineage, has a characteristic t(8;14) translocation, and is related to the Epstein-Barr virus. Cases are generally found in a restricted geographic distribution in Africa that correlates with the regions of holoendemic malaria.22\\nLymphomas related to HIV infection in Western countries are typically high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of B-cell lineage. Large abdominal lymph nodes are frequently seen, often with associated constitutional symptoms. Extranodal disease, particularly bowel involvement, is common.23 Splenomegaly may also be present. In a review of patients who had lymphoma in association with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), 90 percent of the patients with Hodgkin's disease and 84 percent with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had splenomegaly.24 In a case-control study conducted in South Africa between 1992 and 1995, there was a strong association between HIV infection and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, although it was not as strong as that reported in the United States. 25 Patients with rapidly growing lymphoma may have lymph nodes with low-density centers.\\nKaposi's sarcoma, which is associated with human herpesvirus 8 infection, can also cause bulky lymphadenopathy. This tumor was initially reported in elderly men living along the Mediterranean Sea who had indolent skin lesions on their legs, with a minimal effect on their survival. A more aggressive form, known as the endemic or African variant, involves lymphadenopathy, in which there is painless replacement of lymph nodes by tumor. Lymphadenopathic Kaposi's sarcoma predominantly affects children, who often have no skin lesions, unlike young adults with the disease.26\\nEpidemic Kaposi's sarcoma, which is associated with HIV infection, is similarly aggressive, often involves the lymph nodes and viscera,27 and can result in marked mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. However, the enlarged lymph nodes do not have focal low-density areas.28 HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma typically involves the skin, although it can be confined to the viscera. 29 Also, Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common form of HIV-related gastrointestinal neoplasia, and a combination of gastrointestinal and lymph-node disease is not unusual. The tumor can develop in any part of the gastrointestinal tract and typically causes thickening of the bowel wall.30\\nI shall limit my discussion of infections causing bulky lymphadenopathy to mycobacterial and fungal infections. Disseminated histoplasmosis may occur in immunocompromised hosts and often involves the gastrointestinal tract; oral ulcers are the most common manifestation. Distal to the oropharynx, the terminal ileum and proximal colon are the most common sites of involvement. Abdominal lymph nodes are often enlarged, and in patients with acute disseminated disease, they may be markedly enlarged.31 Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis differs from other forms of disseminated histoplasmosis in that pulmonary symptoms and fever may be absent. In a review of 77 cases, only 31 percent of the patients had fever, and only 32 percent had peripheral lymphadenopathy.31 In a review of CT findings in 16 patients with HIV infection and disseminated histoplasmosis, 12 patients had enlarged abdominal lymph nodes, with central areas of low density in 5. The predominant pulmonary radiographic findings were diffuse nodular or reticulonodular infiltrates, although seven patients had normal findings.32 In contrast to the high incidence of disseminated histoplasmosis in HIV-1-infected patients in parts of the United States and Latin America, few cases of coinfection have been reported in African patients.33,34 This distribution may reflect differences between Histoplasma var. duboisii, which is found in Africa, and H. capsulatum, which is endemic in areas surrounding the central river valleys of the Western hemisphere. In rare cases, cryptococcal infection can give rise to bulky lymphadenopathy.35 Other disseminated fungal infections, such as coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis, have been reported in HIV-infected patients, and they may cause abdominal lymphadenopathy, but the pathogens are more likely to be found in parts of the world other than Africa.\\nFinally, extrapulmonary mycobacterial disease, particularly tuberculosis, must be considered because of the patient's residence in an area where it is endemic. The prevalence of intestinal tuberculosis has decreased since the beginning of the 20th century. In an early study, gastrointestinal involvement was found in 69 percent of persons with fatal pulmonary tuberculosis. 36 The subsequent decline in extrapulmonary mycobacterial disease may be related to public health measures, including the routine pasteurization of milk, or to earlier diagnosis and treatment. One mechanism of mycobacterial bowel infection is ingestion of the organisms. Mycobacterium bovis infects many animals, including cattle, and can be present in their milk, causing primary intestinal tuberculosis in humans who ingest it. Widespread pasteurization of milk has virtually eliminated this disease. Ingestion of sputum containing M. tuberculosis or hematogenous seeding during primary infection can also cause gastrointestinal disease. Although tuberculosis can affect any portion of the gastrointestinal tract, the ileocecal region is involved most frequently, possibly because of the concentration of lymphoid tissue in that area.\\nMesenteric lymphadenitis has been reported as the principal manifestation of tuberculosis. In a study conducted before the HIV epidemic, 10 of 59 patients in South Africa who had gastrointestinal tuberculosis presented with mesenteric lymphadenitis. None of the patients had pulmonary involvement; seven had palpable masses.37 In a review of 182 cases of abdominal tuberculosis in India, 38 only 42 percent of the patients had fever, and 11 percent presented with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Masses were detected in patients with hyperplastic ileocecal tuberculosis, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and strictures of the small or large intestine. Of the 86 patients for whom chest radiographs were available, only 24 had evidence of active or inactive pulmonary disease. Thus, the absence of abnormalities on a chest film does not eliminate tuberculosis as a possible diagnosis. A CT scan may demonstrate enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes with low-density centers, as well as mesenteric thickening, omental masses, and ascites.39 Pulmonary disease, fever, weight loss, and abdominal pain are often absent in patients with gastrointestinal tuberculosis, making it difficult to establish the diagnosis. 38,40\\nHIV infection has contributed to the increase in cases of active tuberculosis in many parts of the world. Coinfection varies greatly according to the geographic location. For example, in Nigeria only 6.1 percent of patients with tuberculosis were infected with HIV, as compared with 80 percent in other parts of Africa.41,42 CT findings in coinfected patients included central necrosis of lymph nodes in 31 of 32 HIV-positive patients with abdominal tuberculosis; in contrast, ascites and peritoneal and omental thickening were more prominent in HIV-negative patients. The extensive mesenteric, omental, and peripancreatic lymphadenopathy seen in this patient has also been reported in coinfected patients; other findings have included splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, ascites, bowel involvement, and intrasplenic and intrahepatic masses.43\\nInfection with M. avium complex can give rise to bulky abdominal lymphadenopathy late in the course of HIV infection, when the CD4+ T-cell count has dropped to less than 50 per cubic millimeter.44 Dissemination of M. avium complex infection may involve the blood, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes,45 with symptoms of fever, weight loss, and less often, diarrhea. Laboratory markers of the infection include severe anemia and in many cases an elevation of the alkaline phosphatase level. CT scans may also show enlarged lymph nodes with low-density centers.24 In the United States, infection with M. avium complex occurs in up to 43 percent of patients who have a marked reduction of CD4+ T cells, 46 but the infection is rare in Africa. In a series of 50 HIV-infected patients in Uganda who had severe illness with chronic weight loss, none had blood cultures that were positive for M. avium complex.47\\nAlthough there are similarities in the manifestations of M. avium complex infection and tuberculosis, some features differ. Disseminated tuberculosis occurs earlier in the course of CD4+ T-cell depletion in HIV-infected patients than does infection with M. avium complex. In a review of patients with HIV infection and mycobacterial disease, all the patients infected with M. avium complex had an AIDS-defining illness at or before the time that infection with M. avium complex was diagnosed. In contrast, only 34 percent of those with tuberculosis had an AIDS-defining illness when the tuberculosis was diagnosed. The two groups had similar symptoms and physical findings, but CD4+ T-cell counts were lower in the patients infected with M. avium complex.48,49\\nIn summary, I favor the diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis because of its prevalence in this patient's native country. Although tuberculosis alone can account for the findings, I would test for HIV infection because of the high frequency of coinfection. A definitive diagnosis has to be made rapidly to allow early initiation of therapy. I would recommend a CT-guided, percutaneous needle biopsy of an enlarged lymph node for histopathological examination, special stains, and mycobacterial and fungal cultures.\\nDR. NANCY L. HARRIS: Does the disease cause diarrhea or other bowel symptoms?\\nDR. DAILY: Surprisingly few patients have a change in their bowel habits.\\nDR. ROBERT H. SCHAPIRO: As a gastroenterologist who saw this patient, I was struck by the extensive lymphadenopathy, which resulted in a confluent mass in the left side of the abdomen. I favored the diagnosis of lymphoma over that of tuberculosis.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\n? Lymphoma involving the abdominal lymph nodes.\\nDR. JOHANNA P. DAILY'S DIAGNOSES\\nTuberculous lymphadenitis.\\n? Coinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. SAHA SADEGHI: A specimen from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the abdominal mass revealed aggregates of histiocytes with foamy, granular eosinophilic cytoplasm on a background of fibrous tissue and scattered mononuclear cells (Fig. 3). An acid-fast stain revealed abundant, variably beaded acid-fast bacilli within the histiocytes (Fig. 4). There were no well-formed granulomas, which are typically absent in patients with AIDS, indicating a poor immunologic response to the mycobacteria.50 Culture of the specimen grew M. avium complex (Fig. 5). A serologic test for HIV was positive; the result was confirmed by a Western blot assay. The ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells was inverted (0.03), with a CD4+ count of 2 cells per cubic millimeter.\\nM. avium complex is a complex of two closely related organisms, M. avium and M. intracellulare. M. avium was reported to infect chickens in 1890 and was referred to as the avian tubercle bacillus. 50 M. intracellulare was first cultured in 1969 from the sputum of patients with tuberculosis at the Battey State Hospital in Rome, Georgia; it became known as the Battey bacillus.50 M. avium complex organisms are ubiquitous; they have been isolated throughout the world from soil, house dust, freshwater plants, animal feed and bedding, chickens, and other birds. Human infection occurs mainly through the ingestion of contaminated water or food or the inhalation of aerosols. Human-to-human transmission appears to be minimal. M. avium complex organisms grow slowly and are nonphotochromogenic; they form smooth, cream-colored colonies (Fig. 5).51 In contrast, M. tuberculosis organisms form flat, dry, rough colonies (Fig. 6). The more virulent strains of M. avium complex, however, tend to be rough, and increasingly yellow colonies have been reported in patients with AIDS.52 In contrast to other nontuberculous mycobacteria, M. avium complex can possess plasmids, which may contribute to their virulence.50 Almost all M. avium complex strains isolated from patients with AIDS have plasmids.50\\nA single positive blood culture is considered diagnostic of disseminated M. avium complex infection.45 Positive cultures of bone marrow or abdominal fluid also indicate dissemination of disease. 45 Positive cultures of respiratory tract or gastrointestinal specimens, however, are not diagnostic of dissemination and may reflect colonization by the mycobacteria.\\ninfection differs from that used for M. tuberculosis infection, newer, faster techniques for culture and species identification have been developed, reducing the turnaround time from the usual 5 to 10 weeks to 2 to 4 weeks.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: After the diagnosis was made, this patient was seen by Dr. Basgoz.\\nDR. NESLI BASGOZ: The patient received clarithromycin, ethambutol, and clofazimine for M. avium complex infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy was not given at this time because of concern about additional toxicity and clinical worsening during the phase of acute immune reconstitution that occurs rapidly with this regimen. The patient's condition improved, and he was discharged. Subsequent examination in the outpatient clinic revealed diminished tenderness and a very slow decrease in the size of the mass. Six weeks after he began the mycobacterial therapy, his blood cultures were negative, and his HIV RNA level had fallen from 750,000 copies per milliliter at the time of the diagnosis to 62,000 copies. Two weeks later, he began receiving stavudine, lamivudine, and indinavir for his HIV infection. Within two weeks after starting these drugs, he had increased abdominal pain and tenderness in the region of the mass. However, he did not have a fever, and there was no obvious increase in the size of the mass. Therefore, both types of therapy were continued. The patient has since returned to his native country.\\nDr. Daily, if you had seen the patient after the detection of mycobacteria but before the identification of M. avium complex, how would you have treated him?\\nDR. DAILY: This question highlights the importance of rapid identification of the mycobacterial species. Some clinical laboratories can identify mycobacterial species on the basis of polymerase-chain-reaction testing of pathological specimens, and I would have pursued this approach. Alternatively, a five-drug regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and clarithromycin would adequately cover both M. tuberculosis infection and M. avium complex infection pending the results of culture. Rifabutin would be the preferred type of rifamycin to administer if protease-inhibitor therapy were also started. I agree with the delay of highly active antiretroviral therapy, since it would certainly have worsened the lymphadenitis.\\nDR. MARK: Dr. Daily, does the extensive lymphadenopathy in this case indicate a poor prognosis?\\nDR. DAILY: The burden of mycobacterial disease is a less important prognostic indicator than the patient's ultimate response to antiretroviral therapy. It is critical that the maximal antiretroviral effect be achieved to allow immune reconstitution.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "{'query': \"A 35-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of a painful abdominal mass and fever.\\nThe patient was a native of West Africa who had traveled to the United States several times during the previous three years. He had been generally well except for an episode of typhoid fever five years before admission and multiple bouts of malaria over a number of years; the most recent bout occurred three months before admission. Thirty days before admission, he returned to this country. Three or four days later, fever developed, and his temperature rose to 39.4°C, with shaking chills and a vague headache, followed by constant pain in the left lower abdominal quadrant. Suspecting recurrent malaria, he began to take sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and acetaminophen, but the pain worsened after another week, and he consulted a physician. A stool examination revealed no ova or other evidence of intestinal parasites; blood smears were negative for malaria. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen showed extensive abdominal lymphadenopathy, with thickening of the wall of the adjacent small bowel.\\nThe patient had no knowledge of a previous tuberculin skin test or of a test for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). He was referred to this hospital.\\nThe patient had initially been a farmer but more recently had worked as a teacher. He had had unprotected heterosexual intercourse once five years before admission. His appetite was reduced, and he had lost 10 kg in weight during his illness. He did not have a history of use of alcohol or recreational drugs, tuberculosis or exposure to it, night sweats, cough, hemoptysis, homosexual intercourse, venereal infection, or use of non-Western medicine.\\nThe temperature was 37°C, the pulse was 80, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg.\\nOn physical examination, the patient appeared well. Palpation revealed shotty submental, cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes, which had reportedly been palpable for many years. No thrush was seen. The lungs were clear. A grade 2 systolic murmur was heard at the left sternal border and apex. On abdominal examination, a vaguely outlined, firm mass, 8 cm in diameter, was palpated to the left of the umbilicus; it was immobile, tender, and lobulated. A stool specimen was negative for occult blood.\\nThe urine was positive (+) for urobilinogen and positive (trace) for protein. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 1 and 2).\\nA radiograph of the chest (Fig. 1) showed no abnormalities. A CT scan of the abdomen (Fig. 2) showed multiple, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, several of which had centers of low attenuation. There was mild-to-moderate thickening of the wall of the small bowel but without evidence of obstruction.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. JOHANNA P. DAILY*: May we review the imaging studies?\\nDR. RONALD S. ARELLANO: The film of the chest (Fig. 1) shows no abnormalities. The abdominal CT scan obtained at this hospital (Fig. 2) shows enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, many of which have central areas of low attenuation. There is slight thickening of the small-bowel wall but without evidence of obstruction. The liver, spleen, pancreas, and genitourinary system appear normal.\\nDR. DAILY: It is critical to rule out life-threatening infections in a febrile person who has lived or traveled in the tropics. Malaria, typhoid fever, meningococcal infection, rickettsial disease, and hemorrhagic fever, among other infections, require timely diagnosis and treatment. Travelers should be questioned about exposure to animals and bodies of water, the quality of their water and food, and ingestion of unpasteurized products. Vaccination and prophylaxis against malaria may alter the differential diagnosis, although malaria can develop despite prophylaxis. Finally, the prevalence of a disease among persons who travel to the tropics may differ from the prevalence among residents of the tropics, who have a longer period of exposure. This patient had lived in West Africa most of his life, and we can assume that he had been exposed to tuberculosis, which remains endemic in many parts of Africa. He became febrile shortly after his return from the tropics, and his initial nonspecific symptoms are consistent with the presence of malaria. If a person with such symptoms remains febrile, blood cultures should be performed to rule out bacteremia, and blood smears for malaria should be repeated.\\nThe diagnosis is particularly challenging in patients from the tropics, since they may be infected with multiple pathogens. Many of these agents are rarely or never found outside the tropics. Coinfection with HIV, which may alter or accelerate the course of concomitant diseases, should be considered in this case because of the high prevalence of HIV infection in parts of Africa. It has been estimated that more than 20 million HIV-infected people live on the African continent.¹ Until recently, the rates of HIV infection were lower in West Africa than in other parts of Africa, where an estimated 25 percent of the adult population is infected. However, infection rates have been increasing in West Africa; in parts of Nigeria, for example, an estimated 4.1 percent of adults are infected.2\\nThe most striking feature of this patient's illness is the extensive abdominal lymphadenopathy. Before focusing on the differential diagnosis, I shall consider the possibility of concomitant disease, which is suggested by the lymphopenia and chronic, diffuse, shotty lymphadenopathy, and its relation to the illness for which the patient sought medical care.\\nMany disorders can result in lymphopenia. In a study that antedated the HIV epidemic, a review of 178 cases of lymphopenia (defined as a lymphocyte count of less than 1000 per cubic millimeter) showed that the most common underlying disease was cancer (in 42 percent of cases), primarily colon cancer or lymphoma, for which some patients were receiving cytotoxic or radiation therapy. No underlying disease was detected in 22 percent of the patients. Infections and collagen vascular diseases were encountered less frequently than cancer. Tuberculosis can sometimes result in marked lymphopenia, with a specific decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In three patients with active tuberculosis and lymphocyte counts of less than 900 per cubic millimeter, the lymphopenia resolved completely after the administration of antituberculosis therapy alone.4 These patients had negative serologic tests for HIV type 1 (HIV-1), HIV type 2 (HIV-2), and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I); both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were low, with the preservation of a normal ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells. In contrast, in patients with HIV infection, this ratio becomes inverted.\\nThe profound lymphopenia in this patient suggests the presence of HIV-1 infection, which is the most prevalent retrovirus in parts of West Africa, such as Nigeria. Other retroviruses predominate in other areas.5 For example, HIV-2 is the predominant strain in areas of Guinea-Bissau. HIV-1 group O is found primarily in West Africa, but its prevalence is low, and unlike other HIV-1 groups and HIV-2, it is not detected with standard assays. HIV-1 group O infection also results in a reduced number of CD4+ T cells and the development of opportunistic infections. Specialized testing is required to identify this group of viruses.5\\nThe natural history and complications of HIV-1 infection have been studied extensively in Western countries, but much less is known about those aspects of HIV infection in tropical areas. In a study of HIV-infected patients in rural Uganda, the wasting syndrome was the most common manifestation of late-stage disease (in 46 percent of patients), followed by esophageal candidiasis (in 33 percent), chronic herpes simplex virus infection (in 13 percent), and Kaposi's sarcoma (in 13 percent).7 Other studies have shown a strong association between HIV infection and tuberculosis, probably because of the high prevalence of tuberculosis in Africa. 8,9 Patients who have tuberculosis alone may present with a wasting disease, and antituberculosis therapy is often given to such patients.10 In a prospective study of abdominal pain in patients in South Africa who had HIV infection and a CD4+ T-cell count of less than 200 per cubic millimeter, 11 disseminated tuberculosis was diagnosed most frequently (in 32 percent of the patients). Abdominal lymphadenopathy, ascites, and abscesses were strongly associated with tuberculosis. Most of the patients did not have other coexisting opportunistic infections; only 5 percent had atypical mycobacterial infection. In Africa, unlike the United States and Europe, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia has only rarely been reported as a complication of HIV infection.7\\nInfection with HIV-2, which is found predominantly in West Africa, may also result in lymphopenia. HIV-2 infection causes a slower depletion of CD4+ T cells than does HIV-1 infection, with less effect on morbidity and mortality.12,13 In some studies, however, HIV-2 infection has been closely associated with active tuberculosis and the opportunistic infections to which hospitalized patients are susceptible.9,14\\nAlthough it is unclear whether this patient's chronic generalized, peripheral, shotty lymphadenopathy was caused by a pathologic process, infection with HIV-1, HIV-2, or HTLV-I could account for this finding. Patients infected with HTLV-I are typically asymptomatic, but in rare cases, the virus results in leukemia, lymphoma, or tropical spastic paraparesis.15 In Africa, its seroprevalence rates vary widely according to the region. The prevalence in adults is estimated to range from 0.5 to 1 percent in most African countries and up to 12 percent in specific locations in West Africa. In one very small, population-based cohort study in West Africa, HTLV-I infection did not affect survival during a follow-up period of six years.16\\nOther causes of peripheral lymphadenopathy in West Africa, reported before the HIV epidemic began, include reactive hyperplasia, metastatic cancer, lymphoma, tuberculosis, and toxoplasmosis; Hodgkin's disease and filarial granulomas have also been reported.17 One of the most common extrapulmonary manifestations of tuberculosis is peripheral lymphadenopathy.\\nHIV infection is associated with an increase in cases of active tuberculosis and, in some parts of the world, with increased lymph-node involvement.18 To assess the effect of the HIV epidemic on superficial lymph nodes, a study conducted in Lusaka, Zambia, reviewed the histologic findings in specimens from all lymph-node biopsies performed in 1981, as compared with those performed in 1990; in addition, a cohort of patients undergoing lymph-node biopsy in 1990 was tested for HIV infection.19 The 1990 specimens were much more likely than the 1981 specimens to show evidence of tuberculous lymphadenitis, and in the group of patients who underwent HIV testing, 88 percent of those with tuberculous lymphadenitis had positive tests. Also, findings suggestive of the diagnoses of HIV lymphadenopathy and Kaposi's sarcoma of the lymph nodes were more common in 1990 than in 1981.\\nThe most striking finding in this patient is marked abdominal lymphadenopathy, which is probably due to either cancer or infection. If the correct diagnosis is cancer, the extensive lymphadenopathy and the absence of evidence of a primary tumor elsewhere suggest either lymphoma or Kaposi's sarcoma. In a review of cases of lymphoma reported between 1979 and 1988 in Nigeria, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma accounted for 68 and 32 percent of the cases, respectively. Painless peripheral lymphadenopathy, particularly involving the cervical lymph nodes, was the most frequent clinical presentation. Burkitt's lymphoma was diagnosed primarily in children, who typically presented with an abdominal or pelvic tumor.20 In another study from Nigeria, Burkitt's lymphoma was the most common diagnosis, followed by lymphosarcoma, leukemia, and Hodgkin's disease. 21 Burkitt's lymphoma was originally described in African children who presented with large facial tumors. It is an aggressive tumor of B-cell lineage, has a characteristic t(8;14) translocation, and is related to the Epstein-Barr virus. Cases are generally found in a restricted geographic distribution in Africa that correlates with the regions of holoendemic malaria.22\\nLymphomas related to HIV infection in Western countries are typically high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of B-cell lineage. Large abdominal lymph nodes are frequently seen, often with associated constitutional symptoms. Extranodal disease, particularly bowel involvement, is common.23 Splenomegaly may also be present. In a review of patients who had lymphoma in association with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), 90 percent of the patients with Hodgkin's disease and 84 percent with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had splenomegaly.24 In a case-control study conducted in South Africa between 1992 and 1995, there was a strong association between HIV infection and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, although it was not as strong as that reported in the United States. 25 Patients with rapidly growing lymphoma may have lymph nodes with low-density centers.\\nKaposi's sarcoma, which is associated with human herpesvirus 8 infection, can also cause bulky lymphadenopathy. This tumor was initially reported in elderly men living along the Mediterranean Sea who had indolent skin lesions on their legs, with a minimal effect on their survival. A more aggressive form, known as the endemic or African variant, involves lymphadenopathy, in which there is painless replacement of lymph nodes by tumor. Lymphadenopathic Kaposi's sarcoma predominantly affects children, who often have no skin lesions, unlike young adults with the disease.26\\nEpidemic Kaposi's sarcoma, which is associated with HIV infection, is similarly aggressive, often involves the lymph nodes and viscera,27 and can result in marked mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. However, the enlarged lymph nodes do not have focal low-density areas.28 HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma typically involves the skin, although it can be confined to the viscera. 29 Also, Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common form of HIV-related gastrointestinal neoplasia, and a combination of gastrointestinal and lymph-node disease is not unusual. The tumor can develop in any part of the gastrointestinal tract and typically causes thickening of the bowel wall.30\\nI shall limit my discussion of infections causing bulky lymphadenopathy to mycobacterial and fungal infections. Disseminated histoplasmosis may occur in immunocompromised hosts and often involves the gastrointestinal tract; oral ulcers are the most common manifestation. Distal to the oropharynx, the terminal ileum and proximal colon are the most common sites of involvement. Abdominal lymph nodes are often enlarged, and in patients with acute disseminated disease, they may be markedly enlarged.31 Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis differs from other forms of disseminated histoplasmosis in that pulmonary symptoms and fever may be absent. In a review of 77 cases, only 31 percent of the patients had fever, and only 32 percent had peripheral lymphadenopathy.31 In a review of CT findings in 16 patients with HIV infection and disseminated histoplasmosis, 12 patients had enlarged abdominal lymph nodes, with central areas of low density in 5. The predominant pulmonary radiographic findings were diffuse nodular or reticulonodular infiltrates, although seven patients had normal findings.32 In contrast to the high incidence of disseminated histoplasmosis in HIV-1-infected patients in parts of the United States and Latin America, few cases of coinfection have been reported in African patients.33,34 This distribution may reflect differences between Histoplasma var. duboisii, which is found in Africa, and H. capsulatum, which is endemic in areas surrounding the central river valleys of the Western hemisphere. In rare cases, cryptococcal infection can give rise to bulky lymphadenopathy.35 Other disseminated fungal infections, such as coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis, have been reported in HIV-infected patients, and they may cause abdominal lymphadenopathy, but the pathogens are more likely to be found in parts of the world other than Africa.\\nFinally, extrapulmonary mycobacterial disease, particularly tuberculosis, must be considered because of the patient's residence in an area where it is endemic. The prevalence of intestinal tuberculosis has decreased since the beginning of the 20th century. In an early study, gastrointestinal involvement was found in 69 percent of persons with fatal pulmonary tuberculosis. 36 The subsequent decline in extrapulmonary mycobacterial disease may be related to public health measures, including the routine pasteurization of milk, or to earlier diagnosis and treatment. One mechanism of mycobacterial bowel infection is ingestion of the organisms. Mycobacterium bovis infects many animals, including cattle, and can be present in their milk, causing primary intestinal tuberculosis in humans who ingest it. Widespread pasteurization of milk has virtually eliminated this disease. Ingestion of sputum containing M. tuberculosis or hematogenous seeding during primary infection can also cause gastrointestinal disease. Although tuberculosis can affect any portion of the gastrointestinal tract, the ileocecal region is involved most frequently, possibly because of the concentration of lymphoid tissue in that area.\\nMesenteric lymphadenitis has been reported as the principal manifestation of tuberculosis. In a study conducted before the HIV epidemic, 10 of 59 patients in South Africa who had gastrointestinal tuberculosis presented with mesenteric lymphadenitis. None of the patients had pulmonary involvement; seven had palpable masses.37 In a review of 182 cases of abdominal tuberculosis in India, 38 only 42 percent of the patients had fever, and 11 percent presented with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Masses were detected in patients with hyperplastic ileocecal tuberculosis, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and strictures of the small or large intestine. Of the 86 patients for whom chest radiographs were available, only 24 had evidence of active or inactive pulmonary disease. Thus, the absence of abnormalities on a chest film does not eliminate tuberculosis as a possible diagnosis. A CT scan may demonstrate enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes with low-density centers, as well as mesenteric thickening, omental masses, and ascites.39 Pulmonary disease, fever, weight loss, and abdominal pain are often absent in patients with gastrointestinal tuberculosis, making it difficult to establish the diagnosis. 38,40\\nHIV infection has contributed to the increase in cases of active tuberculosis in many parts of the world. Coinfection varies greatly according to the geographic location. For example, in Nigeria only 6.1 percent of patients with tuberculosis were infected with HIV, as compared with 80 percent in other parts of Africa.41,42 CT findings in coinfected patients included central necrosis of lymph nodes in 31 of 32 HIV-positive patients with abdominal tuberculosis; in contrast, ascites and peritoneal and omental thickening were more prominent in HIV-negative patients. The extensive mesenteric, omental, and peripancreatic lymphadenopathy seen in this patient has also been reported in coinfected patients; other findings have included splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, ascites, bowel involvement, and intrasplenic and intrahepatic masses.43\\nInfection with M. avium complex can give rise to bulky abdominal lymphadenopathy late in the course of HIV infection, when the CD4+ T-cell count has dropped to less than 50 per cubic millimeter.44 Dissemination of M. avium complex infection may involve the blood, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes,45 with symptoms of fever, weight loss, and less often, diarrhea. Laboratory markers of the infection include severe anemia and in many cases an elevation of the alkaline phosphatase level. CT scans may also show enlarged lymph nodes with low-density centers.24 In the United States, infection with M. avium complex occurs in up to 43 percent of patients who have a marked reduction of CD4+ T cells, 46 but the infection is rare in Africa. In a series of 50 HIV-infected patients in Uganda who had severe illness with chronic weight loss, none had blood cultures that were positive for M. avium complex.47\\nAlthough there are similarities in the manifestations of M. avium complex infection and tuberculosis, some features differ. Disseminated tuberculosis occurs earlier in the course of CD4+ T-cell depletion in HIV-infected patients than does infection with M. avium complex. In a review of patients with HIV infection and mycobacterial disease, all the patients infected with M. avium complex had an AIDS-defining illness at or before the time that infection with M. avium complex was diagnosed. In contrast, only 34 percent of those with tuberculosis had an AIDS-defining illness when the tuberculosis was diagnosed. The two groups had similar symptoms and physical findings, but CD4+ T-cell counts were lower in the patients infected with M. avium complex.48,49\\nIn summary, I favor the diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis because of its prevalence in this patient's native country. Although tuberculosis alone can account for the findings, I would test for HIV infection because of the high frequency of coinfection. A definitive diagnosis has to be made rapidly to allow early initiation of therapy. I would recommend a CT-guided, percutaneous needle biopsy of an enlarged lymph node for histopathological examination, special stains, and mycobacterial and fungal cultures.\\nDR. NANCY L. HARRIS: Does the disease cause diarrhea or other bowel symptoms?\\nDR. DAILY: Surprisingly few patients have a change in their bowel habits.\\nDR. ROBERT H. SCHAPIRO: As a gastroenterologist who saw this patient, I was struck by the extensive lymphadenopathy, which resulted in a confluent mass in the left side of the abdomen. I favored the diagnosis of lymphoma over that of tuberculosis.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\n? Lymphoma involving the abdominal lymph nodes.\\nDR. JOHANNA P. DAILY'S DIAGNOSES\\nTuberculous lymphadenitis.\\n? Coinfection with the human immunodeficiency virus.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. SAHA SADEGHI: A specimen from a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the abdominal mass revealed aggregates of histiocytes with foamy, granular eosinophilic cytoplasm on a background of fibrous tissue and scattered mononuclear cells (Fig. 3). An acid-fast stain revealed abundant, variably beaded acid-fast bacilli within the histiocytes (Fig. 4). There were no well-formed granulomas, which are typically absent in patients with AIDS, indicating a poor immunologic response to the mycobacteria.50 Culture of the specimen grew M. avium complex (Fig. 5). A serologic test for HIV was positive; the result was confirmed by a Western blot assay. The ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells was inverted (0.03), with a CD4+ count of 2 cells per cubic millimeter.\\nM. avium complex is a complex of two closely related organisms, M. avium and M. intracellulare. M. avium was reported to infect chickens in 1890 and was referred to as the avian tubercle bacillus. 50 M. intracellulare was first cultured in 1969 from the sputum of patients with tuberculosis at the Battey State Hospital in Rome, Georgia; it became known as the Battey bacillus.50 M. avium complex organisms are ubiquitous; they have been isolated throughout the world from soil, house dust, freshwater plants, animal feed and bedding, chickens, and other birds. Human infection occurs mainly through the ingestion of contaminated water or food or the inhalation of aerosols. Human-to-human transmission appears to be minimal. M. avium complex organisms grow slowly and are nonphotochromogenic; they form smooth, cream-colored colonies (Fig. 5).51 In contrast, M. tuberculosis organisms form flat, dry, rough colonies (Fig. 6). The more virulent strains of M. avium complex, however, tend to be rough, and increasingly yellow colonies have been reported in patients with AIDS.52 In contrast to other nontuberculous mycobacteria, M. avium complex can possess plasmids, which may contribute to their virulence.50 Almost all M. avium complex strains isolated from patients with AIDS have plasmids.50\\nA single positive blood culture is considered diagnostic of disseminated M. avium complex infection.45 Positive cultures of bone marrow or abdominal fluid also indicate dissemination of disease. 45 Positive cultures of respiratory tract or gastrointestinal specimens, however, are not diagnostic of dissemination and may reflect colonization by the mycobacteria.\\ninfection differs from that used for M. tuberculosis infection, newer, faster techniques for culture and species identification have been developed, reducing the turnaround time from the usual 5 to 10 weeks to 2 to 4 weeks.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: After the diagnosis was made, this patient was seen by Dr. Basgoz.\\nDR. NESLI BASGOZ: The patient received clarithromycin, ethambutol, and clofazimine for M. avium complex infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy was not given at this time because of concern about additional toxicity and clinical worsening during the phase of acute immune reconstitution that occurs rapidly with this regimen. The patient's condition improved, and he was discharged. Subsequent examination in the outpatient clinic revealed diminished tenderness and a very slow decrease in the size of the mass. Six weeks after he began the mycobacterial therapy, his blood cultures were negative, and his HIV RNA level had fallen from 750,000 copies per milliliter at the time of the diagnosis to 62,000 copies. Two weeks later, he began receiving stavudine, lamivudine, and indinavir for his HIV infection. Within two weeks after starting these drugs, he had increased abdominal pain and tenderness in the region of the mass. However, he did not have a fever, and there was no obvious increase in the size of the mass. Therefore, both types of therapy were continued. The patient has since returned to his native country.\\nDr. Daily, if you had seen the patient after the detection of mycobacteria but before the identification of M. avium complex, how would you have treated him?\\nDR. DAILY: This question highlights the importance of rapid identification of the mycobacterial species. Some clinical laboratories can identify mycobacterial species on the basis of polymerase-chain-reaction testing of pathological specimens, and I would have pursued this approach. Alternatively, a five-drug regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and clarithromycin would adequately cover both M. tuberculosis infection and M. avium complex infection pending the results of culture. Rifabutin would be the preferred type of rifamycin to administer if protease-inhibitor therapy were also started. I agree with the delay of highly active antiretroviral therapy, since it would certainly have worsened the lymphadenitis.\\nDR. MARK: Dr. Daily, does the extensive lymphadenopathy in this case indicate a poor prognosis?\\nDR. DAILY: The burden of mycobacterial disease is a less important prognostic indicator than the patient's ultimate response to antiretroviral therapy. It is critical that the maximal antiretroviral effect be achieved to allow immune reconstitution.\", 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"Based on the patient's presentation, history, and investigations, the most likely diagnosis is **M. avium complex infection** causing disseminated disease in the setting of HIV-1 infection.\\n\\nHere's the reasoning:\\n\\n1.  **Information Gathering:**\\n    *   **Key Signs/Symptoms:** Abdominal mass, fever, weight loss, reduced appetite, lymphadenopathy.\\n    *   **Duration:** Symptoms have been present for several weeks.\\n    *   **Epidemiologic Context:** Native of West Africa, travel to the US, history of malaria and typhoid fever, recent return from the US.\\n    *   **Comorbidities/Medications:** History of malaria, no known TB or HIV history.\\n    *   **Red-Flag Features:** None explicitly mentioned, but the abdominal mass and lymphadenopathy warrant further investigation.\\n\\n2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\\n    *   **Systemic:** HIV infection, disseminated mycobacterial infection (M. avium complex).\\n    *   **Abdominal:** Lymphadenopathy, abdominal mass.\\n    *   **Timing/Progression:** Symptoms developed after return from the US, suggesting a possible infectious etiology.\\n\\n3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\\n    *   **Defining Features:** Abdominal lymphadenopathy, low CD4+ T-cell count (implied by the patient's history of HIV and the presence of M. avium complex).\\n    *   **Discriminatory Features:** The CT scan showing enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes with low-density centers is suggestive of M. avium complex infection.

Prior treatment consisting of hotcompresses and a course of oral antibiotics had had no effect. The patient had no other symptoms or findings, and theresults of routine blood studies were normal. She had traveled to southern Mexico six weeks earlier for an archaeologicaldig. During her clinic visit, a human botfly larva (Dermatobia hominis) began to emerge from the nodule (Panel A). Thetraditional treatment in areas where myiasis is endemic (Mexico and South and Central America) is occlusion of the fu-runcular punctum with pork fat to stimulate extrusion of the larva. Neither the pork-fat treatment nor surgical treatmentwith a cruciate excision and gentle extraction of the larva was required in this patient, because the larva (approximately2 cm long) (Panel B) emerged from the lesion spontaneously. The female botfly deposits her eggs on the legs or body ofan insect or tick. The patient presumably was infected when bitten by such an insect or tick. At the time of the bite, the botflyeggs hatch, and the larvae quickly burrow into the host's skin. Within days, the host's immune response causes the de-velopment of an inflamed furuncle. The larva has characteristic black, backward-pointing spines that anchor it in the host'sskin and make removal difficult.©2000, Massachusetts Medical Society.MEG A. LEMON, M.D.JOHN L.

He also had a pruritic rash coveringthe gluteal region. The rash and itching had start-ed about two weeks earlier, during the last weekof a month-long vacation on the coast of Thai-land, and had increased in intensity despite top-ical treatment with fusidic acid (Fucicort) creamand calamine lotion. Two days before the patientwas admitted, a dermatologist in Israel had di-agnosed folliculitis and prescribed 2 g of cepha-lexin daily. One day before admission, a chest x-rayfilm obtained because of the cough showed finereticulonodular infiltrates in both lower lung fieldsand over the right middle lobe, with mild en-largement of both hilar regions. Treatment with300 mg of roxithromycin daily was initiated.Before his trip to Thailand the patient had hadall the recommended vaccinations but had not re-ceived the recommended prophylaxis against ma-laria. While there, he had had sexual relations withseveral partners. A girlfriend who was with himin Thailand reported having a similar pruritic rashbut no fever or cough. The patient's medical his-tory included mild vesicourethral reflux, with noepisodes of urinary tract infection, and surgeryfor left varicocele and for deviation of the nasalseptum.The patient was in good general condition, withno dyspnea. His oral temperature was 37.6°C, hisblood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg, and his pulsewas 80 beats per minute and regular. There wasno tenderness over the sinuses, and no abnor-malities were noted in the throat, nose, or ears.The heart sounds were normal, with no murmurs,and the lungs were clear. Neither the liver nor thespleen was palpable, and there was no lymphad-enopathy. A diffuse, red, papular rash was notedover the entire gluteal region (Fig. 1).At first glance, the mild fever and cough, giventheir short duration, might be thought to be due toan upper respiratory tract infection. Because of theabnormal findings on the chest film, I would obtaina white-cell count and repeat the chest radiographyto look for pneumonia. In addition, the history ofvesicourethral reflux and nasal-septum surgery, despitethe absence of symptoms suggesting urinary tract orsinus infection, point to these disorders as a possiblecause of the fever. Both urinalysis and radiographyof the sinuses are in order.I also wonder whether the gluteal rash and the va-cation in Thailand may somehow be linked to the fe-ver and the lung disease. The fact that a similar rashwas noted in the patient's girlfriend suggests an in-fectious cause. Although folliculitis can cause fever,it does not explain the pulmonary symptoms. Further-more, the two-week duration of the rash before theappearance of the fever is evidence against a causal as-sociation with the pulmonary disease. A dermatologistis needed to make a definitive diagnosis of the rash.The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 28 mmper hour. The hemoglobin level was 17 g per dec-iliter, with a hematocrit of 52.8 percent; thewhite-cell count was 13,200 per cubic millimeter,with 72 percent segmented forms, 15 percent lym-phocytes, 9 percent monocytes, and 4 percent eo-sinophils; and the platelet count was 267,000 percubic millimeter. The results of tests of liver andkidney function, measurement of serum calcium,and the urinalysis were all normal. Cultures ofurine, blood, and sputum were negative. Oxygensaturation was 96 percent while the patient wasbreathing room air. A chest x-ray film showed in-terstitial infiltrates in the base of both lungs andmild hilar lymphadenopathy (Fig. 2). Abdominalultrasonography revealed no abnormalities.The dermatology consultant thought that therash was consistent with the presence of papulardermatitis, folliculitis, and possibly contact derma-titis. A biopsy of a gluteal lesion was performed.An infectious-disease consultant agreed with thedermatologist's assessment and raised the possibil-ity of seabather's eruption (a rash that occurs onareas of the body covered by a bathing suit)¹ as aseparate entity from the pulmonary disease.It seems at this point that the patient's symptomsare mainly pulmonary.

Rash on the Patient's Gluteal Region.tosis and the interstitial infiltrates, a diagnosis of nei-ther upper respiratory tract infection nor pneumococ-cal pneumonia seems to fit. However, other infectiouscauses should be investigated. Given the discrepancybetween the normal pulmonary auscultatory findingsand the prominent radiologic findings, atypical pneu-monia is a possibility. I would perform serologic testsfor chlamydia and mycoplasma. With respect to thepatient's stay in Thailand, the possibility of infectionwith the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) com-plicated by an opportunistic infection with Pneumo-cystis carinii or tuberculosis should be considered.Eosinophilic pneumonia can be ruled out on thebasis of the radiographic findings and the fact thatthe pulmonary symptoms occurred before cephalex-in therapy (which could cause eosinophilia) was be-gun. Also, with respect to the skin and pulmonaryfindings, the possibility of an infection caused by aparasite that penetrated the skin in the gluteal regionand migrated to the lungs should not be overlooked.The absence of eosinophilia does not support the pos-sibility of this diagnosis, but the results of the skin bi-opsy may be helpful. Other possibilities include non-infectious causes such as sarcoidosis and lymphoma,which may cause fever, hilar lymphadenopathy, andrash. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of thechest may be helpful.The patient continued to have a nonproductivecough accompanied by malaise and fever (temper-ature of up to 38.2°C). Treatment with roxithro-mycin was continued, and treatment with clobe-tasol propionate ointment was begun. A CT scanof the lungs showed bilateral interstitial infiltratesand mild, probably reactive, hilar lymphadenop-athy, consistent with the presence of interstitialpneumonia. A test for HIV antibodies and a tu-berculin skin test with purified protein derivativewere negative. The serum angiotensin-convert-ing enzyme level was normal. Tests of pulmonaryfunction showed mild obstruction that was re-versible on bronchodilation, with no restriction orabnormal diffusion. The skin biopsy revealed mildperivascular lymphocytic infiltrates with some eo-sinophils in the dermis and no parasites or ovafindings consistent with a diagnosis of contactdermatitis. Tests of serum were strongly positivefor IgM antibodies against Mycoplasma pnеито-niae, as determined by enzyme-linked immuno-assay, and were negative for Chlamydia psittaciand C. pneumoniae. The test for cold agglutininswas negative.The most logical diagnosis is mycoplasma pneu-monia. The low-grade fever, malaise, and dry coughcombined with minimal physical findings but numer-ous radiologic findings are all consistent with thepresence of this disease. The interstitial lung infiltrateswith hilar lymphadenopathy are also characteristic.Volume 342 Number 221659The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

All rights reserved.The New England Journal of MedicineMycoplasma pneumonia occurs most commonly inchildren and young adults and accounts for 15 to 20percent of all cases of pneumonia in this age group.Although such epidemic diseases have a greater tend-ency to occur during the autumn (approximately thetime of this patient's illness) and early winter, they canin fact appear any time. The strongly positive IgMserologic findings provide support for this diagnosis,and the negative cold-agglutinin test does not rule itout, because the test is negative in up to 20 percentof affected patients and levels peak only during thesecond and third weeks of the disease.I still wonder, however, whether the rash is linkedto the pneumonia. A variety of transient dermatologicconditions have been reported in conjunction withM. pneumoniae infection. A nondescript maculopap-ular rash and sometimes even erythema multiformeand the Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been report-ed in up to 7 percent of affected patients, but thecourse of this patient's illness and the type of rashthat he had are evidence against this link. Althoughmycoplasma pneumonia is a self-limiting disease, an-tibiotic therapy may substantially shorten its dura-tion. I would like to see the patient's antibiotic ther-apy continued.The daily dose of roxithromycin was increasedfrom 300 mg to 600 mg; however, there was noimprovement in the fever, malaise, cough, or rash.On the fourth hospital day, the patient's white-cell count was 14,400 per cubic millimeter, with68 percent segmented forms, 11 percent lym-phocytes, 11 percent monocytes, and 10 percenteosinophils. During the next few days, the white-cell count increased to 19,200 per cubic millime-ter, with 36 percent eosinophils (total eosinophilcount, 6900 per cubic millimeter). A chest x-rayfilm showed an increase in the pulmonary infil-trates.The leukocytosis, especially the increase in the eo-sinophil count, would be very unusual in a patientwith mycoplasma pneumonia. The differential diag-nosis of eosinophilia includes infections, allergies, in-flammations, and endocrinologic and neoplastic en-tities; however, by focusing on the findings in thispatient, it can be greatly narrowed. The most commoncause of eosinophilia is an allergic reaction to drugs.Though several antibiotics, such as penicillin, sulfona-mides, and cephalosporins, have been implicated ineosinophilia and eosinophilic pneumonia, roxithro-mycin has not. Löffler's syndrome, the allergic gran-ulomatosis that characterizes the Churg-Strauss syn-drome, allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis, and theeosinophilia-myalgia syndrome can all cause eosin-ophilic pneumonia. However, the combination of thepatient's stay in Thailand, the appearance of the pap-ulopruritic rash which his girlfriend also hadand the development of marked eosinophilia suggestsan acute tropical pneumonia caused by a parasitic in-fection. Filariasis, which affects about 250 million peo-ple worldwide, would be the most likely infection,but these manifestations may also be caused by ascaris,ancylostoma, toxocara, and strongyloides.3-5 Paragon-imiasis, a disease common in the Far East and Africa,can also cause pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophil-ia, but it would not account for the rash in the pa-tient under discussion.6Since the therapeutic options for these possibili-ties range from specific antiparasitic drugs to gluco-corticoids, in the case of Löffler's syndrome or otherhypersensitivity syndromes, a definite diagnosis is man-datory. Reexamination of the sputum as well as ex-amination of the stool for parasites is less invasive thanbronchoscopy and may be worth trying first. Sincesuch parasitic infections are very uncommon in Israel,I would want experienced persons to look for theparasites in the stool and sputum samples and to re-examine the skin-biopsy specimen. If these resultsare not helpful, I would proceed to bronchoscopy.The serum IgE level was more than 1000 IUper milliliter. Reexamination of the skin-biopsyspecimen revealed no parasites, nor did the stoolexamination. Examination of the sputum in a cen-tral laboratory revealed one larva (Fig. 3), iden-tified as a hookworm (Ancylostoma duodenale).Hookworm infection seems to be the most likelydiagnosis. About 25 percent of people in the worldare infected by hookworm, though most such infec-tions are asymptomatic. The adult hookworm produc-es thousands of eggs that develop into larvae in thesoil. Most likely, during the patient's stay in Thai-land, where hookworm infection is common, he con-tracted the infection while sitting in a place heavilycontaminated by larvae, whose penetration of his skincaused the gluteal pruritic rash. After penetrating theskin, the larvae migrated through hematologic andlymphatic pathways to the lungs, causing eosinophilicpneumonia approximately two weeks later. The pos-itive result of testing for IgM antibody against my-coplasma pneumonia was probably a false positive.Since it takes at least five or six weeks for the parasiteto reach the small intestine, no eggs were found inthe patient's feces.Treatment with 400 mg of albendazole wasgiven daily for three days. The fever and respira-tory symptoms resolved, and the rash improvedslowly. Approximately 10 days later, the white-cellcount was 6000 per cubic millimeter, with 14 per-cent eosinophils. A chest x-ray film showed almostcomplete disappearance of the lung infiltrates.The patient's girlfriend, who did not have a fe-ver or respiratory symptoms, was later treated1660June 1, 2000The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Hookworm Larva in the Patient's Sputum (×88).similarly, with the subsequent disappearance ofher rash.COMMENTARYClinical thinking is a multistep process. Laborato-ry tests help the clinician select the most likelyand preferably the only — diagnosis. The diagnosiscan be considered definite only after the expectedresponse to therapy occurs. The key to good clinicalthinking is keeping an open mind, not committingoneself to a single diagnosis, and devising new hy-potheses as additional information becomes available.The value of a detailed history taking cannot beoveremphasized. Despite the apparent diagnosis ofinterstitial pneumonia in the patient under discus-sion, the two-week history of pruritic rash, the pa-tient's recent stay in Thailand, and the occurrence ofa similar rash in his girlfriend raised the discussant'ssuspicion that another infectious process was actual-ly responsible.The initial diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infectionseemed reasonable because of the high prevalence ofthis disease, the patient's symptoms, and the strong-ly positive test for IgM antibodies. Levels of specificIgM antibody increase soon after the onset of my-coplasma pneumonia and decrease relatively quicklythereafter. The reported sensitivity of this assay is 80to 90 percent, and the specificity is 87 to 94 per-cent.7 Although a high level of antibodies indicatesthe presence of active disease, some factors such asantigenic cross-reactivity and measurement of serumlevels too early can lead to false positive and falsenegative results, respectively.Although the patient was treated for M. pneuто-niae infection, his condition worsened and eosino-philia developed. The possibility that the eosinophiliaPhysicians sometimes prefer sophisticated diagnos-tic procedures to simple ones. Fiberoptic bronchos-copy is commonly used to evaluate cases of complicat-ed or progressive pneumonia. It has a high diagnosticyield but is an invasive procedure. Although exami-nation of a sputum sample to identify parasites is onlyoccasionally diagnostic, the discussant preferred tostart with this noninvasive test. The results of thesputum examination established the probable diag-nosis. The prevalence of hookworm infection is high inThailand and many other places throughout theworld.3 Most infections remain asymptomatic, thoughboth acute symptoms (pneumonia, mild transientcough, and rash) and chronic symptoms (anemia andgastrointestinal effects) have been described. Afterpenetrating the skin, the larvae eventually reach thelung capillaries and alveolar sacs and then migrate tothe bronchi and trachea; they are then swallowed andmove into the stomach and intestines. They attachto the intestinal mucosa and mature sexually. The fe-male begins to deposit eggs a few weeks after the ini-tial infection. The activity of the larvae in the lungsusually produces no symptoms, but various respira-tory symptoms, such as cough, dyspnea, and hemop-tysis, may develop. Not infrequently, the definitive di-agnosis may be difficult to establish in the early stageof infection unless larvae are fortuitously identifiedin a sputum sample. Once the hookworms mature inthe small intestine, eggs may be found in stool.8We are indebted to Professor M. Fainaru for reviewing the manu-script, to Drs. J. Ekstein, S. Pitlik, M. Druker, Z.

He also had a pruritic rash coveringthe gluteal region. The rash and itching had start-ed about two weeks earlier, during the last weekof a month-long vacation on the coast of Thai-land, and had increased in intensity despite top-ical treatment with fusidic acid (Fucicort) creamand calamine lotion. Two days before the patientwas admitted, a dermatologist in Israel had di-agnosed folliculitis and prescribed 2 g of cepha-lexin daily. One day before admission, a chest x-rayfilm obtained because of the cough showed finereticulonodular infiltrates in both lower lung fieldsand over the right middle lobe, with mild en-largement of both hilar regions. Treatment with300 mg of roxithromycin daily was initiated.Before his trip to Thailand the patient had hadall the recommended vaccinations but had not re-ceived the recommended prophylaxis against ma-laria. While there, he had had sexual relations withseveral partners. A girlfriend who was with himin Thailand reported having a similar pruritic rashbut no fever or cough. The patient's medical his-tory included mild vesicourethral reflux, with noepisodes of urinary tract infection, and surgeryfor left varicocele and for deviation of the nasalseptum.The patient was in good general condition, withno dyspnea. His oral temperature was 37.6°C, hisblood pressure was 120/80 mm Hg, and his pulsewas 80 beats per minute and regular. There wasno tenderness over the sinuses, and no abnor-malities were noted in the throat, nose, or ears.The heart sounds were normal, with no murmurs,and the lungs were clear. Neither the liver nor thespleen was palpable, and there was no lymphad-enopathy. A diffuse, red, papular rash was notedover the entire gluteal region (Fig. 1).At first glance, the mild fever and cough, giventheir short duration, might be thought to be due toan upper respiratory tract infection. Because of theabnormal findings on the chest film, I would obtaina white-cell count and repeat the chest radiographyto look for pneumonia. In addition, the history ofvesicourethral reflux and nasal-septum surgery, despitethe absence of symptoms suggesting urinary tract orsinus infection, point to these disorders as a possiblecause of the fever. Both urinalysis and radiographyof the sinuses are in order.I also wonder whether the gluteal rash and the va-cation in Thailand may somehow be linked to the fe-ver and the lung disease. The fact that a similar rashwas noted in the patient's girlfriend suggests an in-fectious cause. Although folliculitis can cause fever,it does not explain the pulmonary symptoms. Further-more, the two-week duration of the rash before theappearance of the fever is evidence against a causal as-sociation with the pulmonary disease. A dermatologistis needed to make a definitive diagnosis of the rash.The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 28 mmper hour. The hemoglobin level was 17 g per dec-iliter, with a hematocrit of 52.8 percent; thewhite-cell count was 13,200 per cubic millimeter,with 72 percent segmented forms, 15 percent lym-phocytes, 9 percent monocytes, and 4 percent eo-sinophils; and the platelet count was 267,000 percubic millimeter. The results of tests of liver andkidney function, measurement of serum calcium,and the urinalysis were all normal. Cultures ofurine, blood, and sputum were negative. Oxygensaturation was 96 percent while the patient wasbreathing room air. A chest x-ray film showed in-terstitial infiltrates in the base of both lungs andmild hilar lymphadenopathy (Fig. 2). Abdominalultrasonography revealed no abnormalities.The dermatology consultant thought that therash was consistent with the presence of papulardermatitis, folliculitis, and possibly contact derma-titis. A biopsy of a gluteal lesion was performed.An infectious-disease consultant agreed with thedermatologist's assessment and raised the possibil-ity of seabather's eruption (a rash that occurs onareas of the body covered by a bathing suit)¹ as aseparate entity from the pulmonary disease.It seems at this point that the patient's symptomsare mainly pulmonary.

Rash on the Patient's Gluteal Region.tosis and the interstitial infiltrates, a diagnosis of nei-ther upper respiratory tract infection nor pneumococ-cal pneumonia seems to fit. However, other infectiouscauses should be investigated. Given the discrepancybetween the normal pulmonary auscultatory findingsand the prominent radiologic findings, atypical pneu-monia is a possibility. I would perform serologic testsfor chlamydia and mycoplasma. With respect to thepatient's stay in Thailand, the possibility of infectionwith the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) com-plicated by an opportunistic infection with Pneumo-cystis carinii or tuberculosis should be considered.Eosinophilic pneumonia can be ruled out on thebasis of the radiographic findings and the fact thatthe pulmonary symptoms occurred before cephalex-in therapy (which could cause eosinophilia) was be-gun. Also, with respect to the skin and pulmonaryfindings, the possibility of an infection caused by aparasite that penetrated the skin in the gluteal regionand migrated to the lungs should not be overlooked.The absence of eosinophilia does not support the pos-sibility of this diagnosis, but the results of the skin bi-opsy may be helpful. Other possibilities include non-infectious causes such as sarcoidosis and lymphoma,which may cause fever, hilar lymphadenopathy, andrash. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of thechest may be helpful.The patient continued to have a nonproductivecough accompanied by malaise and fever (temper-ature of up to 38.2°C). Treatment with roxithro-mycin was continued, and treatment with clobe-tasol propionate ointment was begun. A CT scanof the lungs showed bilateral interstitial infiltratesand mild, probably reactive, hilar lymphadenop-athy, consistent with the presence of interstitialpneumonia. A test for HIV antibodies and a tu-berculin skin test with purified protein derivativewere negative. The serum angiotensin-convert-ing enzyme level was normal. Tests of pulmonaryfunction showed mild obstruction that was re-versible on bronchodilation, with no restriction orabnormal diffusion. The skin biopsy revealed mildperivascular lymphocytic infiltrates with some eo-sinophils in the dermis and no parasites or ovafindings consistent with a diagnosis of contactdermatitis. Tests of serum were strongly positivefor IgM antibodies against Mycoplasma pnеито-niae, as determined by enzyme-linked immuno-assay, and were negative for Chlamydia psittaciand C. pneumoniae. The test for cold agglutininswas negative.The most logical diagnosis is mycoplasma pneu-monia. The low-grade fever, malaise, and dry coughcombined with minimal physical findings but numer-ous radiologic findings are all consistent with thepresence of this disease. The interstitial lung infiltrateswith hilar lymphadenopathy are also characteristic.Volume 342 Number 221659The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

All rights reserved.The New England Journal of MedicineMycoplasma pneumonia occurs most commonly inchildren and young adults and accounts for 15 to 20percent of all cases of pneumonia in this age group.Although such epidemic diseases have a greater tend-ency to occur during the autumn (approximately thetime of this patient's illness) and early winter, they canin fact appear any time. The strongly positive IgMserologic findings provide support for this diagnosis,and the negative cold-agglutinin test does not rule itout, because the test is negative in up to 20 percentof affected patients and levels peak only during thesecond and third weeks of the disease.I still wonder, however, whether the rash is linkedto the pneumonia. A variety of transient dermatologicconditions have been reported in conjunction withM. pneumoniae infection. A nondescript maculopap-ular rash and sometimes even erythema multiformeand the Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been report-ed in up to 7 percent of affected patients, but thecourse of this patient's illness and the type of rashthat he had are evidence against this link. Althoughmycoplasma pneumonia is a self-limiting disease, an-tibiotic therapy may substantially shorten its dura-tion. I would like to see the patient's antibiotic ther-apy continued.The daily dose of roxithromycin was increasedfrom 300 mg to 600 mg; however, there was noimprovement in the fever, malaise, cough, or rash.On the fourth hospital day, the patient's white-cell count was 14,400 per cubic millimeter, with68 percent segmented forms, 11 percent lym-phocytes, 11 percent monocytes, and 10 percenteosinophils. During the next few days, the white-cell count increased to 19,200 per cubic millime-ter, with 36 percent eosinophils (total eosinophilcount, 6900 per cubic millimeter). A chest x-rayfilm showed an increase in the pulmonary infil-trates.The leukocytosis, especially the increase in the eo-sinophil count, would be very unusual in a patientwith mycoplasma pneumonia. The differential diag-nosis of eosinophilia includes infections, allergies, in-flammations, and endocrinologic and neoplastic en-tities; however, by focusing on the findings in thispatient, it can be greatly narrowed. The most commoncause of eosinophilia is an allergic reaction to drugs.Though several antibiotics, such as penicillin, sulfona-mides, and cephalosporins, have been implicated ineosinophilia and eosinophilic pneumonia, roxithro-mycin has not. Löffler's syndrome, the allergic gran-ulomatosis that characterizes the Churg-Strauss syn-drome, allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis, and theeosinophilia-myalgia syndrome can all cause eosin-ophilic pneumonia. However, the combination of thepatient's stay in Thailand, the appearance of the pap-ulopruritic rash which his girlfriend also hadand the development of marked eosinophilia suggestsan acute tropical pneumonia caused by a parasitic in-fection. Filariasis, which affects about 250 million peo-ple worldwide, would be the most likely infection,but these manifestations may also be caused by ascaris,ancylostoma, toxocara, and strongyloides.3-5 Paragon-imiasis, a disease common in the Far East and Africa,can also cause pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophil-ia, but it would not account for the rash in the pa-tient under discussion.6Since the therapeutic options for these possibili-ties range from specific antiparasitic drugs to gluco-corticoids, in the case of Löffler's syndrome or otherhypersensitivity syndromes, a definite diagnosis is man-datory. Reexamination of the sputum as well as ex-amination of the stool for parasites is less invasive thanbronchoscopy and may be worth trying first. Sincesuch parasitic infections are very uncommon in Israel,I would want experienced persons to look for theparasites in the stool and sputum samples and to re-examine the skin-biopsy specimen. If these resultsare not helpful, I would proceed to bronchoscopy.The serum IgE level was more than 1000 IUper milliliter. Reexamination of the skin-biopsyspecimen revealed no parasites, nor did the stoolexamination. Examination of the sputum in a cen-tral laboratory revealed one larva (Fig. 3), iden-tified as a hookworm (Ancylostoma duodenale).Hookworm infection seems to be the most likelydiagnosis. About 25 percent of people in the worldare infected by hookworm, though most such infec-tions are asymptomatic. The adult hookworm produc-es thousands of eggs that develop into larvae in thesoil. Most likely, during the patient's stay in Thai-land, where hookworm infection is common, he con-tracted the infection while sitting in a place heavilycontaminated by larvae, whose penetration of his skincaused the gluteal pruritic rash. After penetrating theskin, the larvae migrated through hematologic andlymphatic pathways to the lungs, causing eosinophilicpneumonia approximately two weeks later. The pos-itive result of testing for IgM antibody against my-coplasma pneumonia was probably a false positive.Since it takes at least five or six weeks for the parasiteto reach the small intestine, no eggs were found inthe patient's feces.Treatment with 400 mg of albendazole wasgiven daily for three days. The fever and respira-tory symptoms resolved, and the rash improvedslowly. Approximately 10 days later, the white-cellcount was 6000 per cubic millimeter, with 14 per-cent eosinophils. A chest x-ray film showed almostcomplete disappearance of the lung infiltrates.The patient's girlfriend, who did not have a fe-ver or respiratory symptoms, was later treated1660June 1, 2000The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Laborato-ry tests help the clinician select the most likelyand preferably the only — diagnosis. The diagnosiscan be considered definite only after the expectedresponse to therapy occurs. The key to good clinicalthinking is keeping an open mind, not committingoneself to a single diagnosis, and devising new hy-potheses as additional information becomes available.The value of a detailed history taking cannot beoveremphasized. Despite the apparent diagnosis ofinterstitial pneumonia in the patient under discus-sion, the two-week history of pruritic rash, the pa-tient's recent stay in Thailand, and the occurrence ofa similar rash in his girlfriend raised the discussant'ssuspicion that another infectious process was actual-ly responsible.The initial diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infectionseemed reasonable because of the high prevalence ofthis disease, the patient's symptoms, and the strong-ly positive test for IgM antibodies. Levels of specificIgM antibody increase soon after the onset of my-coplasma pneumonia and decrease relatively quicklythereafter. The reported sensitivity of this assay is 80to 90 percent, and the specificity is 87 to 94 per-cent.7 Although a high level of antibodies indicatesthe presence of active disease, some factors such asantigenic cross-reactivity and measurement of serumlevels too early can lead to false positive and falsenegative results, respectively.Although the patient was treated for M. pneuто-niae infection, his condition worsened and eosino-philia developed. The possibility that the eosinophiliaPhysicians sometimes prefer sophisticated diagnos-tic procedures to simple ones. Fiberoptic bronchos-copy is commonly used to evaluate cases of complicat-ed or progressive pneumonia. It has a high diagnosticyield but is an invasive procedure. Although exami-nation of a sputum sample to identify parasites is onlyoccasionally diagnostic, the discussant preferred tostart with this noninvasive test. The results of thesputum examination established the probable diag-nosis. The prevalence of hookworm infection is high inThailand and many other places throughout theworld.3 Most infections remain asymptomatic, thoughboth acute symptoms (pneumonia, mild transientcough, and rash) and chronic symptoms (anemia andgastrointestinal effects) have been described. Afterpenetrating the skin, the larvae eventually reach thelung capillaries and alveolar sacs and then migrate tothe bronchi and trachea; they are then swallowed andmove into the stomach and intestines. They attachto the intestinal mucosa and mature sexually. The fe-male begins to deposit eggs a few weeks after the ini-tial infection. The activity of the larvae in the lungsusually produces no symptoms, but various respira-tory symptoms, such as cough, dyspnea, and hemop-tysis, may develop. Not infrequently, the definitive di-agnosis may be difficult to establish in the early stageof infection unless larvae are fortuitously identifiedin a sputum sample. Once the hookworms mature inthe small intestine, eggs may be found in stool.8We are indebted to Professor M. Fainaru for reviewing the manu-script, to Drs. J. Ekstein, S. Pitlik, M. Druker, Z.

KENNETH H. MAYER*: The salient features\\nof this case are pain in the left knee of 3 months' du-\\nration; a motor vehicle accident that resulted in an\\nopen fracture of the midshaft of the left tibia 12\\nyears earlier, with subsequent healing; and a pre-\\nsumptive diagnosis of the acquired immunodeficien-\\ncy syndrome (AIDS) 3 years before admission that\\nis only presumptive because of a suspected but un-\\nconfirmed diagnosis of P. carinii pneumonia. The\\npatient now meets the criteria for AIDS of the Cen-\\nters for Disease Control and Prevention, even if the\\npneumonia was not due to P. carinii infection, since\\nhis CD4 lymphocyte count on admission to this\\nhospital was only 81 cells per cubic millimeter. The\\npatient acquired HIV infection by injecting drugs,\\nwhich also put him at risk for complications of bac-\\nteremia. On admission, however, he was afebrile, and\\nthe physical examination and laboratory tests showed\\nno signs of infection.\\nMay we review the radiologic findings?\\nDR. SUSAN V. KATTAPURAM: The bone scan ob-\\ntained after the administration of technetium-99m-\\nlabeled methylene diphosphonate (Fig. 1) shows an\\narea of increased uptake in the proximal portion of\\nthe left tibia. The center of the lesion has less uptake\\nthan the margins, where uptake is considerable. The\\nanteroposterior radiograph (Fig. 2) shows a lytic lesion\\nin the proximal lateral portion of the tibia, extend-\\ning to the subarticular margin and the metaphysis,\\nand a smaller lesion in the proximal medial portion\\nof the tibia. There is bony sclerosis between these\\ntwo lesions. The margins of the larger lesion are fair-\\nly well defined. The articular surface of the tibia is\\nintact. There is no joint effusion.\\nA proton-density-weighted coronal image from an\\nMRI scan of the tibia (Fig. 3) shows that the lesion\\nin the proximal lateral portion of the tibia has low\\nsignal intensity and is demarcated by a rim of high\\nsignal intensity, indicating edema of the marrow. The\\nmedial collateral ligament is intact, the menisci and\\nthe articular surfaces of the proximal tibia and fem-\\noral condyles are normal, and there is no evidence\\nof a soft-tissue mass. The proton-density-weighted\\naxial image shows that the lesion has a small soft-tis-\\nsue component separating the anteromedial aspect\\nof the cortex and the pes anserinus. The T2-weighted\\naxial and coronal images show areas of heterogeneous\\nsignal intensity in the lesion; the appearance of the\\nsurrounding tissue suggests the presence of reactive\\nmarrow or fibrous tissue.\\nDR. MAYER: The differential diagnosis of this case\\nis complex because the patient's injury was sustained\\n12 years earlier, resulting in the possible introduc-\\ntion of foreign material, microorganisms, or both at\\nthat time. The patient was subsequently asymptomat-\\nic, however, and the pain in his knee developed in\\nthe absence of more recent trauma. Unfortunately, his\\nHIV infection was treated with a regimen of two nu-\\ncleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, which would\\nnow be considered substandard antiretroviral therapy.\\nThe case report does not include information about\\nthe peripheral-blood viral load at the time of admis-\\nsion, so we do not know how effective these medi-\\ncations had been in suppressing the HIV infection.\\nThe history of probable P. carinii pneumonia and the\\nlow CD4 cell count, however, corroborate the pres-\\nence of severe immunosuppression.\\nOne plausible explanation of the salient features of\\nthe patient's history and the radiographic and MRI\\nevidence of localized bony destruction is that a fas-\\ntidious saprophytic organism was introduced into the\\n*Chief, Infectious Disease Division, Memorial Hospital, Pawtucket, R.I.;\\nmedical research director, Fenway Community Health Center, Boston; pro-\\nfessor of medicine and community health, Brown University, Providence, R.I.\\nVolume 343 Number 4\\n283\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

It was\\nquiescent initially but was subsequently able to rep-\\nlicate because of the failure of the patient's immune\\nsystem. It is also possible that because of scar forma-\\ntion and compromised vascularity of the bone after\\nthe accident, an organism was introduced more re-\\ncently, during an episode of asymptomatic bactere-\\nmia or fungemia, and proliferated in the hypovascu-\\nlar tissue.\\nA third possible explanation is that a microorgan-\\nism was introduced into the bone when the patient\\nwas injecting drugs, perhaps as a result of septic mi-\\ncroemboli associated with subacute bacterial endo-\\ncarditis. However, the absence of systemic manifes-\\ntations, the absence of anemia despite advanced HIV\\ninfection, and the low erythrocyte sedimentation rate\\nmake this explanation unlikely. Moreover, the lesions\\nwere found only at the site of the previous trauma,\\nwith no evidence of metastatic foci.\\nThe probable diagnosis in this case is chronic os-\\nteomyelitis - specifically, Brodie's abscess. Sir Ben-\\njamin Collins Brodie (1783–1862) was the British\\nsurgeon who first described this lesion, which is char-\\nacterized by a roughly spherical region of bony de-\\nstruction filled with purulent material, connective tis-\\nsue, or both. Patients with these localized lesions may\\npresent with a fever, but in chronic cases patients are\\nusually afebrile and have dull pain and radiologic ev-\\nidence of periosteal elevation. This patient's lesion was\\ncharacteristic of Brodie's abscess in that it involved\\nthe proximal portion of the tibia adjacent to the me-\\ntaphysis. In most cases, there is a single lesion, but\\nin this case, there may have been a secondary lesion,\\nin addition to the primary focus of involvement. The\\natypical aspect of this case is the patient's age, since\\nthree quarters of patients with Brodie's abscess are\\nless than 25 years old. The most common causative\\nagent is Staphylococcus aureus.\\nBone infections have been classified as either hem-\\natogenous or due to a contiguous focus of infec-\\ntion.1,2 The latter type has been subdivided on the\\nbasis of the presence or absence of vascular insuffi-\\nciency. In this case, there was probably some com-\\npromise of the vascular supply of the bone as a result\\nof the automobile accident. According to the radio-\\ngraphic and MRI studies, both the medullary and\\nthe periosteal blood supplies to the bone were com-\\npromised, and there were large areas of dead bone\\n(sequestra). Microorganisms can be difficult to erad-\\nicate in such areas, even if the patient has a strong\\nimmune response and is treated with surgery, anti-\\nbiotic therapy, or both. Thus, in this immunocom-\\npromised patient, a small focus of acute osteomyeli-\\ntis could have evolved into chronic disease. Features\\nof this case that are characteristic of chronic osteo-\\nmyelitis are the sequestra, scar tissue, radiographic ev-\\nidence of reactive sclerosis, adjacent soft-tissue ische-\\nmia with edema, and a progressive clinical course. The\\ncourse of osteomyelitis may be altered by host fac-\\ntors that affect immune surveillance, metabolism, and\\nlocal vascularity. In this case, HIV-associated immu-\\nnosuppression may have precipitated the reactivation\\nand progression of the infected nidus.\\nThe pathophysiologic aspects of osteomyelitis are\\ncomplex. The bone may form a substrate for the in-\\ncreased replication of infectious organisms, resulting\\nin the elaboration of polysaccharides. The polysac-\\ncharides, in turn, form a polymer matrix that is less\\nsusceptible to host defenses and antibiotics than is\\nthe systemic circulation. Acute osteomyelitis is char-\\nacterized by a suppurative phase, with the rapid re-\\ncruitment of inflammatory cells, tissue necrosis, and\\nobliteration of vascular channels by inflammation and\\nbacterial invasion. Subsequently, chronic microvascu-\\nlar compromise may occur, and sequestered bone may\\nbecome necrotic, with exuberant reactive bone for-\\nmation. The injection of bacteria into the blood-\\nstream in animals that have not been subjected to\\ntrauma may cause osteomyelitis, but if the bones have\\nbeen traumatized, the disease can be induced with\\nthe introduction of a much smaller number of or-\\nganisms.\\nHIV disease is associated with a number of im-\\nmune deficits that favor the development of osteomy-\\nelitis. In addition to the well-documented decrease\\nin the CD4 lymphocyte count, antigen and mitogen\\nresponses are diminished, and the activity of cyto-\\ntoxic T lymphocytes is decreased. Diminished humoral\\nresponsiveness may also make the host more suscep-\\ntible to bacteremia and serious suppurative infections.\\nThis patient was receiving trimethoprim-sulfameth-\\noxazole as prophylaxis against recurrent P. carinii\\npneumonia, but it is possible that he was not taking\\nhis medication as prescribed or that his bone lesions\\nwere due to an organism that was resistant to the\\ndrug. Other diminished immune responses to specific\\npathogens have been well documented. Thus, a pa-\\ntient with a CD4 lymphocyte count of less than 100\\ncells per cubic millimeter may be susceptible to in-\\nfection with a wide variety of organisms that have been\\nassociated with chronic osteomyelitis, including atyp-\\nical mycobacteria and fungi that disseminate.\\nThe spectrum of cases of osteomyelitis has changed.\\nThirty years ago, almost half the cases were due to\\nS. aureus infection, but the number of gram-nega-\\ntive infections subsequently increased; the number\\nof polymicrobial infections has remained large (Ta-\\nble 3).2 Because this patient was infected with HIV\\nand had used intravenous drugs, a large number of\\nmicroorganisms could have caused the Brodie's ab-\\nscess, including S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas\\naeruginosa and other gram-negative rods, and Can-\\ndida albicans (Table 4). The absence of metastatic\\nfoci and systemic manifestations suggests that the in-\\nfection was related to the patient's immunodeficient\\nstate and compromised bony microvasculature or that\\n284\\nJuly 27, 2000\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Atypical mycobacteria\\nsuch as Mycobacterium marinum, M. gordonae, M. for-\\ntuitum, and M. chelonei are endemic in the environ-\\nment in New England and have a propensity for op-\\nportunistic growth in patients with AIDS who do\\nnot inject drugs. Finally, because of the reactive scle-\\nrosis in this case, one cannot rule out the possibility\\nof an occult tumor, such as an osteogenic sarcoma, in\\nan area of suppuration and chronic scarring. How-\\never, a bone tumor is much less likely than an atypical\\ninfection in a patient with advanced HIV disease.\\nThe first step in managing osteomyelitis is to per-\\nform a bone biopsy, with cultures and staining for\\natypical mycobacteria and fungi, in order to identify\\nall possible causative organisms. This patient's infection\\ncould be due to multiple microorganisms and may\\nrequire treatment with several antimicrobial agents.\\nTreatment with antibiotics alone is not sufficient,\\nhowever, to eradicate this type of infection. Because\\nthe infected necrotic bone is poorly perfused in pa-\\ntients with chronic osteomyelitis, adequate drainage,\\nthorough débridement, prevention of dead space, re-\\nmoval of any stabilizing device (e.g., a pin or plate),\\nprotection of the wound, and specific antimicrobial\\ntherapy are all required to ensure an adequate clinical\\nresult. If possible, antibiotic agents should be with-\\nheld until the biopsy specimen has been cultured\\nand the sensitivity of the causative organisms to spe-\\ncific agents is known.\\nThe lesion should be débrided until all nonviable\\ntissue and foreign bodies have been removed. To en-\\nsure adequate antibiotic penetration and to prevent\\ncontinued sequestration, the cancellous and cortical\\nbone remaining in the wound after débridement must\\nbleed uniformly. Since it takes at least three or four\\nweeks for bone to be revascularized after débride-\\nment, antibiotics must be administered during this\\nperiod to prevent the reactivation of microfoci of in-\\nfection. The removal of sequestered bone must be\\nfollowed by intravenous administration of antibiotics\\nfor at least six weeks in order to eradicate the micro-\\norganisms. Once the bone has been sterilized, one can\\ndecide whether a pin, plate, or other device should\\nbe used to help stabilize the bone. External stabili-\\nzation with a cast is often required for a period of\\nweeks or months before such devices can be inserted.\\nDR. ANDREW E.

FRANCIS J. HORNICEK, JR.: We considered\\nthe possibility of a malignant tumor as part of the\\ndifferential diagnosis. After the appropriate imaging\\nstudies had been performed, we concluded that an\\nopen biopsy was required. Tissue obtained from the\\nopen biopsy performed at the time of surgery was\\nsent for frozen-section examination. Curettage of the\\ncavity was performed, followed by insertion of poly-\\nmethyl methacrylate cement. The subchondral bone\\nwas intact, and no supplemental fixation was required.\\nDR. ROSENBERG: The biopsy specimen contained\\nnumerous large, necrotizing granulomas composed\\nof epithelioid histiocytes and Langhans-type giant\\ncells (Fig. 4). The granulomas had replaced the mar-\\nrow and caused resorption of the cancellous bone.\\nZiehl-Neelsen staining showed the presence of bead-\\ned acid-fast bacilli in the necrotic debris. M. avium\\ncomplex was identified in the microbiologic culture\\nof the specimen. Therefore, the diagnosis is granu-\\nlomatous osteomyelitis caused by M. avium complex.\\nMusculoskeletal infection in patients with HIV in-\\nfection is uncommon, with a prevalence of 0 to 4 per-\\ncent in large series. The types of infections have in-\\ncluded septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, septic bursitis,\\nand pyomyositis. Fewer than 50 cases of osteomyeli-\\ntis associated with HIV infection have been reported.\\nThe known risk factors for HIV infection in these\\ncases were intravenous drug use (35 percent), ho-\\nmosexuality (24 percent), and previous blood trans-\\nfusion (6 percent).3 A variety of anatomical sites were\\naffected, and approximately 21 percent of the patients\\ndied. S. aureus was considered the primary pathogen\\nin approximately 15 percent of the cases.\\nAtypical mycobacteria have been identified in 33\\nHIV-infected patients with osteomyelitis.3-6 This com-\\nplication is a late sequela of HIV infection and is usu-\\nally associated with a low CD4 cell count, since cell-\\nmediated immunity is an important defense against\\natypical mycobacteria. In the reported cases, the sites\\nof involvement included the small bones of the hands\\nand feet, the tibia, the femur, and the calvaria.3-6 Mul-\\ntiple skeletal sites or joints were affected in many cas-\\nes, and associated cutaneous lesions were common.\\nM. haemophilum was isolated on culture in 16 cases,\\nM. kansasii in 9, M. avium complex in 5, and M. avi-\\num complex and M. kansasii in 2. A regimen of mul-\\ntiple antibiotic agents has been the treatment of choice\\nfor osteomyelitis caused by infection with atypical\\nmycobacteria. The clinical course has varied, because\\nsome infections have been indolent and others have\\nbeen rapidly progressive.\\nIt is perplexing that M. avium complex is respon-\\nsible for only a small percentage of cases of osteomy-\\nelitis due to atypical mycobacteria, since this organism\\nis the most common cause of disseminated myco-\\nbacterial infection in patients with AIDS. M. avium\\nFigure 4. Granuloma Containing Langhans-Type, Multinucleat-\\ned Giant Cells (Hematoxylin and Eosin, ×500).\\ncomplex is ubiquitous; it is present in soil, natural wa-\\nter supplies, and dust. Infection usually occurs through\\ningestion or inhalation of the organism or direct in-\\noculation during trauma. In patients with AIDS,\\nM. avium complex infection is believed to be a pri-\\nmary infection rather than a reactivation of a previ-\\nous infection. In the patient under discussion, the\\ninfection may have been new or may have been as-\\nsociated with the previous fracture.\\nDR. ANGELA M. CALIENDO: Were blood cultures\\nperformed?\\nDR. ROSENBERG: Blood cultures were performed,\\nand the results were negative.\\nDR. MAYER: Dr. Rosenberg, although the infection\\nwas caused by an atypical organism, do you think\\nthat the radiographic and histopathological findings\\nare consistent with the diagnosis of Brodie's abscess?\\nThe intense inflammatory-cell reaction differs from\\nthe usual response I have seen, even in patients with\\nintact immune systems who have atypical mycobac-\\nterial disease. Such an intense inflammatory response\\nseems surprising, especially if the infection had been\\npresent for up to 12 years.\\nDR. ROSENBERG: The determination of whether\\nthis patient's lesion meets the criteria for the di-\\nagnosis of Brodie's abscess is subjective. Brodie de-\\nscribed a suppurative inflammatory infiltrate composed\\nof polymorphonuclear leukocytes, not a granuloma-\\ntous response. Patients with M. avium complex in-\\nfection usually do not have the prominent granulo-\\nmatous reaction seen in this patient. They have an\\ninfiltrate of histiocytes containing large numbers of\\nbacteria, without necrosis or granuloma formation.\\nThe reaction in this case is more characteristic of tu-\\nberculosis in an immunocompetent patient.\\n286\\nJuly 27, 2000\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

KENNETH H. MAYER*: The salient features\\nof this case are pain in the left knee of 3 months' du-\\nration; a motor vehicle accident that resulted in an\\nopen fracture of the midshaft of the left tibia 12\\nyears earlier, with subsequent healing; and a pre-\\nsumptive diagnosis of the acquired immunodeficien-\\ncy syndrome (AIDS) 3 years before admission that\\nis only presumptive because of a suspected but un-\\nconfirmed diagnosis of P. carinii pneumonia. The\\npatient now meets the criteria for AIDS of the Cen-\\nters for Disease Control and Prevention, even if the\\npneumonia was not due to P. carinii infection, since\\nhis CD4 lymphocyte count on admission to this\\nhospital was only 81 cells per cubic millimeter. The\\npatient acquired HIV infection by injecting drugs,\\nwhich also put him at risk for complications of bac-\\nteremia. On admission, however, he was afebrile, and\\nthe physical examination and laboratory tests showed\\nno signs of infection.\\nMay we review the radiologic findings?\\nDR. SUSAN V. KATTAPURAM: The bone scan ob-\\ntained after the administration of technetium-99m-\\nlabeled methylene diphosphonate (Fig. 1) shows an\\narea of increased uptake in the proximal portion of\\nthe left tibia. The center of the lesion has less uptake\\nthan the margins, where uptake is considerable. The\\nanteroposterior radiograph (Fig. 2) shows a lytic lesion\\nin the proximal lateral portion of the tibia, extend-\\ning to the subarticular margin and the metaphysis,\\nand a smaller lesion in the proximal medial portion\\nof the tibia. There is bony sclerosis between these\\ntwo lesions. The margins of the larger lesion are fair-\\nly well defined. The articular surface of the tibia is\\nintact. There is no joint effusion.\\nA proton-density-weighted coronal image from an\\nMRI scan of the tibia (Fig. 3) shows that the lesion\\nin the proximal lateral portion of the tibia has low\\nsignal intensity and is demarcated by a rim of high\\nsignal intensity, indicating edema of the marrow. The\\nmedial collateral ligament is intact, the menisci and\\nthe articular surfaces of the proximal tibia and fem-\\noral condyles are normal, and there is no evidence\\nof a soft-tissue mass. The proton-density-weighted\\naxial image shows that the lesion has a small soft-tis-\\nsue component separating the anteromedial aspect\\nof the cortex and the pes anserinus. The T2-weighted\\naxial and coronal images show areas of heterogeneous\\nsignal intensity in the lesion; the appearance of the\\nsurrounding tissue suggests the presence of reactive\\nmarrow or fibrous tissue.\\nDR. MAYER: The differential diagnosis of this case\\nis complex because the patient's injury was sustained\\n12 years earlier, resulting in the possible introduc-\\ntion of foreign material, microorganisms, or both at\\nthat time. The patient was subsequently asymptomat-\\nic, however, and the pain in his knee developed in\\nthe absence of more recent trauma. Unfortunately, his\\nHIV infection was treated with a regimen of two nu-\\ncleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, which would\\nnow be considered substandard antiretroviral therapy.\\nThe case report does not include information about\\nthe peripheral-blood viral load at the time of admis-\\nsion, so we do not know how effective these medi-\\ncations had been in suppressing the HIV infection.\\nThe history of probable P. carinii pneumonia and the\\nlow CD4 cell count, however, corroborate the pres-\\nence of severe immunosuppression.\\nOne plausible explanation of the salient features of\\nthe patient's history and the radiographic and MRI\\nevidence of localized bony destruction is that a fas-\\ntidious saprophytic organism was introduced into the\\n*Chief, Infectious Disease Division, Memorial Hospital, Pawtucket, R.I.;\\nmedical research director, Fenway Community Health Center, Boston; pro-\\nfessor of medicine and community health, Brown University, Providence, R.I.\\nVolume 343 Number 4\\n283\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

It was\\nquiescent initially but was subsequently able to rep-\\nlicate because of the failure of the patient's immune\\nsystem. It is also possible that because of scar forma-\\ntion and compromised vascularity of the bone after\\nthe accident, an organism was introduced more re-\\ncently, during an episode of asymptomatic bactere-\\nmia or fungemia, and proliferated in the hypovascu-\\nlar tissue.\\nA third possible explanation is that a microorgan-\\nism was introduced into the bone when the patient\\nwas injecting drugs, perhaps as a result of septic mi-\\ncroemboli associated with subacute bacterial endo-\\ncarditis. However, the absence of systemic manifes-\\ntations, the absence of anemia despite advanced HIV\\ninfection, and the low erythrocyte sedimentation rate\\nmake this explanation unlikely. Moreover, the lesions\\nwere found only at the site of the previous trauma,\\nwith no evidence of metastatic foci.\\nThe probable diagnosis in this case is chronic os-\\nteomyelitis - specifically, Brodie's abscess. Sir Ben-\\njamin Collins Brodie (1783–1862) was the British\\nsurgeon who first described this lesion, which is char-\\nacterized by a roughly spherical region of bony de-\\nstruction filled with purulent material, connective tis-\\nsue, or both. Patients with these localized lesions may\\npresent with a fever, but in chronic cases patients are\\nusually afebrile and have dull pain and radiologic ev-\\nidence of periosteal elevation. This patient's lesion was\\ncharacteristic of Brodie's abscess in that it involved\\nthe proximal portion of the tibia adjacent to the me-\\ntaphysis. In most cases, there is a single lesion, but\\nin this case, there may have been a secondary lesion,\\nin addition to the primary focus of involvement. The\\natypical aspect of this case is the patient's age, since\\nthree quarters of patients with Brodie's abscess are\\nless than 25 years old. The most common causative\\nagent is Staphylococcus aureus.\\nBone infections have been classified as either hem-\\natogenous or due to a contiguous focus of infec-\\ntion.1,2 The latter type has been subdivided on the\\nbasis of the presence or absence of vascular insuffi-\\nciency. In this case, there was probably some com-\\npromise of the vascular supply of the bone as a result\\nof the automobile accident. According to the radio-\\ngraphic and MRI studies, both the medullary and\\nthe periosteal blood supplies to the bone were com-\\npromised, and there were large areas of dead bone\\n(sequestra). Microorganisms can be difficult to erad-\\nicate in such areas, even if the patient has a strong\\nimmune response and is treated with surgery, anti-\\nbiotic therapy, or both. Thus, in this immunocom-\\npromised patient, a small focus of acute osteomyeli-\\ntis could have evolved into chronic disease. Features\\nof this case that are characteristic of chronic osteo-\\nmyelitis are the sequestra, scar tissue, radiographic ev-\\nidence of reactive sclerosis, adjacent soft-tissue ische-\\nmia with edema, and a progressive clinical course. The\\ncourse of osteomyelitis may be altered by host fac-\\ntors that affect immune surveillance, metabolism, and\\nlocal vascularity. In this case, HIV-associated immu-\\nnosuppression may have precipitated the reactivation\\nand progression of the infected nidus.\\nThe pathophysiologic aspects of osteomyelitis are\\ncomplex. The bone may form a substrate for the in-\\ncreased replication of infectious organisms, resulting\\nin the elaboration of polysaccharides. The polysac-\\ncharides, in turn, form a polymer matrix that is less\\nsusceptible to host defenses and antibiotics than is\\nthe systemic circulation. Acute osteomyelitis is char-\\nacterized by a suppurative phase, with the rapid re-\\ncruitment of inflammatory cells, tissue necrosis, and\\nobliteration of vascular channels by inflammation and\\nbacterial invasion. Subsequently, chronic microvascu-\\nlar compromise may occur, and sequestered bone may\\nbecome necrotic, with exuberant reactive bone for-\\nmation. The injection of bacteria into the blood-\\nstream in animals that have not been subjected to\\ntrauma may cause osteomyelitis, but if the bones have\\nbeen traumatized, the disease can be induced with\\nthe introduction of a much smaller number of or-\\nganisms.\\nHIV disease is associated with a number of im-\\nmune deficits that favor the development of osteomy-\\nelitis. In addition to the well-documented decrease\\nin the CD4 lymphocyte count, antigen and mitogen\\nresponses are diminished, and the activity of cyto-\\ntoxic T lymphocytes is decreased. Diminished humoral\\nresponsiveness may also make the host more suscep-\\ntible to bacteremia and serious suppurative infections.\\nThis patient was receiving trimethoprim-sulfameth-\\noxazole as prophylaxis against recurrent P. carinii\\npneumonia, but it is possible that he was not taking\\nhis medication as prescribed or that his bone lesions\\nwere due to an organism that was resistant to the\\ndrug. Other diminished immune responses to specific\\npathogens have been well documented. Thus, a pa-\\ntient with a CD4 lymphocyte count of less than 100\\ncells per cubic millimeter may be susceptible to in-\\nfection with a wide variety of organisms that have been\\nassociated with chronic osteomyelitis, including atyp-\\nical mycobacteria and fungi that disseminate.\\nThe spectrum of cases of osteomyelitis has changed.\\nThirty years ago, almost half the cases were due to\\nS. aureus infection, but the number of gram-nega-\\ntive infections subsequently increased; the number\\nof polymicrobial infections has remained large (Ta-\\nble 3).2 Because this patient was infected with HIV\\nand had used intravenous drugs, a large number of\\nmicroorganisms could have caused the Brodie's ab-\\nscess, including S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas\\naeruginosa and other gram-negative rods, and Can-\\ndida albicans (Table 4). The absence of metastatic\\nfoci and systemic manifestations suggests that the in-\\nfection was related to the patient's immunodeficient\\nstate and compromised bony microvasculature or that\\n284\\nJuly 27, 2000\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Atypical mycobacteria\\nsuch as Mycobacterium marinum, M. gordonae, M. for-\\ntuitum, and M. chelonei are endemic in the environ-\\nment in New England and have a propensity for op-\\nportunistic growth in patients with AIDS who do\\nnot inject drugs. Finally, because of the reactive scle-\\nrosis in this case, one cannot rule out the possibility\\nof an occult tumor, such as an osteogenic sarcoma, in\\nan area of suppuration and chronic scarring. How-\\never, a bone tumor is much less likely than an atypical\\ninfection in a patient with advanced HIV disease.\\nThe first step in managing osteomyelitis is to per-\\nform a bone biopsy, with cultures and staining for\\natypical mycobacteria and fungi, in order to identify\\nall possible causative organisms. This patient's infection\\ncould be due to multiple microorganisms and may\\nrequire treatment with several antimicrobial agents.\\nTreatment with antibiotics alone is not sufficient,\\nhowever, to eradicate this type of infection. Because\\nthe infected necrotic bone is poorly perfused in pa-\\ntients with chronic osteomyelitis, adequate drainage,\\nthorough débridement, prevention of dead space, re-\\nmoval of any stabilizing device (e.g., a pin or plate),\\nprotection of the wound, and specific antimicrobial\\ntherapy are all required to ensure an adequate clinical\\nresult. If possible, antibiotic agents should be with-\\nheld until the biopsy specimen has been cultured\\nand the sensitivity of the causative organisms to spe-\\ncific agents is known.\\nThe lesion should be débrided until all nonviable\\ntissue and foreign bodies have been removed. To en-\\nsure adequate antibiotic penetration and to prevent\\ncontinued sequestration, the cancellous and cortical\\nbone remaining in the wound after débridement must\\nbleed uniformly. Since it takes at least three or four\\nweeks for bone to be revascularized after débride-\\nment, antibiotics must be administered during this\\nperiod to prevent the reactivation of microfoci of in-\\nfection. The removal of sequestered bone must be\\nfollowed by intravenous administration of antibiotics\\nfor at least six weeks in order to eradicate the micro-\\norganisms. Once the bone has been sterilized, one can\\ndecide whether a pin, plate, or other device should\\nbe used to help stabilize the bone. External stabili-\\nzation with a cast is often required for a period of\\nweeks or months before such devices can be inserted.\\nDR. ANDREW E. ROSENBERG: Since you are mak-\\ning a diagnosis of osteomyelitis, can you pinpoint\\nthe most likely causative organism?\\nDR. MAYER: I favor mycobacteria — specifically,\\natypical organisms such as M. chelonei, M. gordonae,\\nM. fortuitum, or M. avium complex.\\nDR.

FRANCIS J. HORNICEK, JR.: We considered\\nthe possibility of a malignant tumor as part of the\\ndifferential diagnosis. After the appropriate imaging\\nstudies had been performed, we concluded that an\\nopen biopsy was required. Tissue obtained from the\\nopen biopsy performed at the time of surgery was\\nsent for frozen-section examination. Curettage of the\\ncavity was performed, followed by insertion of poly-\\nmethyl methacrylate cement. The subchondral bone\\nwas intact, and no supplemental fixation was required.\\nDR. ROSENBERG: The biopsy specimen contained\\nnumerous large, necrotizing granulomas composed\\nof epithelioid histiocytes and Langhans-type giant\\ncells (Fig. 4). The granulomas had replaced the mar-\\nrow and caused resorption of the cancellous bone.\\nZiehl-Neelsen staining showed the presence of bead-\\ned acid-fast bacilli in the necrotic debris. M. avium\\ncomplex was identified in the microbiologic culture\\nof the specimen. Therefore, the diagnosis is granu-\\nlomatous osteomyelitis caused by M. avium complex.\\nMusculoskeletal infection in patients with HIV in-\\nfection is uncommon, with a prevalence of 0 to 4 per-\\ncent in large series. The types of infections have in-\\ncluded septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, septic bursitis,\\nand pyomyositis. Fewer than 50 cases of osteomyeli-\\ntis associated with HIV infection have been reported.\\nThe known risk factors for HIV infection in these\\ncases were intravenous drug use (35 percent), ho-\\nmosexuality (24 percent), and previous blood trans-\\nfusion (6 percent).3 A variety of anatomical sites were\\naffected, and approximately 21 percent of the patients\\ndied. S. aureus was considered the primary pathogen\\nin approximately 15 percent of the cases.\\nAtypical mycobacteria have been identified in 33\\nHIV-infected patients with osteomyelitis.3-6 This com-\\nplication is a late sequela of HIV infection and is usu-\\nally associated with a low CD4 cell count, since cell-\\nmediated immunity is an important defense against\\natypical mycobacteria. In the reported cases, the sites\\nof involvement included the small bones of the hands\\nand feet, the tibia, the femur, and the calvaria.3-6 Mul-\\ntiple skeletal sites or joints were affected in many cas-\\nes, and associated cutaneous lesions were common.\\nM. haemophilum was isolated on culture in 16 cases,\\nM. kansasii in 9, M. avium complex in 5, and M. avi-\\num complex and M. kansasii in 2. A regimen of mul-\\ntiple antibiotic agents has been the treatment of choice\\nfor osteomyelitis caused by infection with atypical\\nmycobacteria. The clinical course has varied, because\\nsome infections have been indolent and others have\\nbeen rapidly progressive.\\nIt is perplexing that M. avium complex is respon-\\nsible for only a small percentage of cases of osteomy-\\nelitis due to atypical mycobacteria, since this organism\\nis the most common cause of disseminated myco-\\nbacterial infection in patients with AIDS. M. avium\\nFigure 4. Granuloma Containing Langhans-Type, Multinucleat-\\ned Giant Cells (Hematoxylin and Eosin, ×500).\\ncomplex is ubiquitous; it is present in soil, natural wa-\\nter supplies, and dust. Infection usually occurs through\\ningestion or inhalation of the organism or direct in-\\noculation during trauma. In patients with AIDS,\\nM. avium complex infection is believed to be a pri-\\nmary infection rather than a reactivation of a previ-\\nous infection. In the patient under discussion, the\\ninfection may have been new or may have been as-\\nsociated with the previous fracture.\\nDR. ANGELA M. CALIENDO: Were blood cultures\\nperformed?\\nDR. ROSENBERG: Blood cultures were performed,\\nand the results were negative.\\nDR. MAYER: Dr. Rosenberg, although the infection\\nwas caused by an atypical organism, do you think\\nthat the radiographic and histopathological findings\\nare consistent with the diagnosis of Brodie's abscess?\\nThe intense inflammatory-cell reaction differs from\\nthe usual response I have seen, even in patients with\\nintact immune systems who have atypical mycobac-\\nterial disease. Such an intense inflammatory response\\nseems surprising, especially if the infection had been\\npresent for up to 12 years.\\nDR. ROSENBERG: The determination of whether\\nthis patient's lesion meets the criteria for the di-\\nagnosis of Brodie's abscess is subjective. Brodie de-\\nscribed a suppurative inflammatory infiltrate composed\\nof polymorphonuclear leukocytes, not a granuloma-\\ntous response. Patients with M. avium complex in-\\nfection usually do not have the prominent granulo-\\nmatous reaction seen in this patient. They have an\\ninfiltrate of histiocytes containing large numbers of\\nbacteria, without necrosis or granuloma formation.\\nThe reaction in this case is more characteristic of tu-\\nberculosis in an immunocompetent patient.\\n286\\nJuly 27, 2000\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

The\\npatient acquired HIV infection by injecting drugs,\\nwhich also put him at risk for complications of bac-\\nteremia. On admission, however, he was afebrile, and\\nthe physical examination and laboratory tests showed\\nno signs of infection.\\nMay we review the radiologic findings?\\nDR. SUSAN V. KATTAPURAM: The bone scan ob-\\ntained after the administration of technetium-99m-\\nlabeled methylene diphosphonate (Fig. 1) shows an\\narea of increased uptake in the proximal portion of\\nthe left tibia. The center of the lesion has less uptake\\nthan the margins, where uptake is considerable. The\\nanteroposterior radiograph (Fig. 2) shows a lytic lesion\\nin the proximal lateral portion of the tibia, extend-\\ning to the subarticular margin and the metaphysis,\\nand a smaller lesion in the proximal medial portion\\nof the tibia. There is bony sclerosis between these\\ntwo lesions. The margins of the larger lesion are fair-\\nly well defined. The articular surface of the tibia is\\nintact. There is no joint effusion.\\nA proton-density-weighted coronal image from an\\nMRI scan of the tibia (Fig. 3) shows that the lesion\\nin the proximal lateral portion of the tibia has low\\nsignal intensity and is demarcated by a rim of high\\nsignal intensity, indicating edema of the marrow. The\\nmedial collateral ligament is intact, the menisci and\\nthe articular surfaces of the proximal tibia and fem-\\noral condyles are normal, and there is no evidence\\nof a soft-tissue mass. The proton-density-weighted\\naxial image shows that the lesion has a small soft-tis-\\nsue component separating the anteromedial aspect\\nof the cortex and the pes anserinus. The T2-weighted\\naxial and coronal images show areas of heterogeneous\\nsignal intensity in the lesion; the appearance of the\\nsurrounding tissue suggests the presence of reactive\\nmarrow or fibrous tissue.\\nDR. MAYER: The differential diagnosis of this case\\nis complex because the patient's injury was sustained\\n12 years earlier, resulting in the possible introduc-\\ntion of foreign material, microorganisms, or both at\\nthat time. The patient was subsequently asymptomat-\\nic, however, and the pain in his knee developed in\\nthe absence of more recent trauma. Unfortunately, his\\nHIV infection was treated with a regimen of two nu-\\ncleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, which would\\nnow be considered substandard antiretroviral therapy.\\nThe case report does not include information about\\nthe peripheral-blood viral load at the time of admis-\\nsion, so we do not know how effective these medi-\\ncations had been in suppressing the HIV infection.\\nThe history of probable P. carinii pneumonia and the\\nlow CD4 cell count, however, corroborate the pres-\\nence of severe immunosuppression.\\nOne plausible explanation of the salient features of\\nthe patient's history and the radiographic and MRI\\nevidence of localized bony destruction is that a fas-\\ntidious saprophytic organism was introduced into the\\n*Chief, Infectious Disease Division, Memorial Hospital, Pawtucket, R.I.;\\nmedical research director, Fenway Community Health Center, Boston; pro-\\nfessor of medicine and community health, Brown University, Providence, R.I.\\nVolume 343 Number 4\\n283\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

It was\\nquiescent initially but was subsequently able to rep-\\nlicate because of the failure of the patient's immune\\nsystem. It is also possible that because of scar forma-\\ntion and compromised vascularity of the bone after\\nthe accident, an organism was introduced more re-\\ncently, during an episode of asymptomatic bactere-\\nmia or fungemia, and proliferated in the hypovascu-\\nlar tissue.\\nA third possible explanation is that a microorgan-\\nism was introduced into the bone when the patient\\nwas injecting drugs, perhaps as a result of septic mi-\\ncroemboli associated with subacute bacterial endo-\\ncarditis. However, the absence of systemic manifes-\\ntations, the absence of anemia despite advanced HIV\\ninfection, and the low erythrocyte sedimentation rate\\nmake this explanation unlikely. Moreover, the lesions\\nwere found only at the site of the previous trauma,\\nwith no evidence of metastatic foci.\\nThe probable diagnosis in this case is chronic os-\\nteomyelitis - specifically, Brodie's abscess. Sir Ben-\\njamin Collins Brodie (1783–1862) was the British\\nsurgeon who first described this lesion, which is char-\\nacterized by a roughly spherical region of bony de-\\nstruction filled with purulent material, connective tis-\\nsue, or both. Patients with these localized lesions may\\npresent with a fever, but in chronic cases patients are\\nusually afebrile and have dull pain and radiologic ev-\\nidence of periosteal elevation. This patient's lesion was\\ncharacteristic of Brodie's abscess in that it involved\\nthe proximal portion of the tibia adjacent to the me-\\ntaphysis. In most cases, there is a single lesion, but\\nin this case, there may have been a secondary lesion,\\nin addition to the primary focus of involvement. The\\natypical aspect of this case is the patient's age, since\\nthree quarters of patients with Brodie's abscess are\\nless than 25 years old. The most common causative\\nagent is Staphylococcus aureus.\\nBone infections have been classified as either hem-\\natogenous or due to a contiguous focus of infec-\\ntion.1,2 The latter type has been subdivided on the\\nbasis of the presence or absence of vascular insuffi-\\nciency. In this case, there was probably some com-\\npromise of the vascular supply of the bone as a result\\nof the automobile accident. According to the radio-\\ngraphic and MRI studies, both the medullary and\\nthe periosteal blood supplies to the bone were com-\\npromised, and there were large areas of dead bone\\n(sequestra). Microorganisms can be difficult to erad-\\nicate in such areas, even if the patient has a strong\\nimmune response and is treated with surgery, anti-\\nbiotic therapy, or both. Thus, in this immunocom-\\npromised patient, a small focus of acute osteomyeli-\\ntis could have evolved into chronic disease. Features\\nof this case that are characteristic of chronic osteo-\\nmyelitis are the sequestra, scar tissue, radiographic ev-\\nidence of reactive sclerosis, adjacent soft-tissue ische-\\nmia with edema, and a progressive clinical course. The\\ncourse of osteomyelitis may be altered by host fac-\\ntors that affect immune surveillance, metabolism, and\\nlocal vascularity. In this case, HIV-associated immu-\\nnosuppression may have precipitated the reactivation\\nand progression of the infected nidus.\\nThe pathophysiologic aspects of osteomyelitis are\\ncomplex. The bone may form a substrate for the in-\\ncreased replication of infectious organisms, resulting\\nin the elaboration of polysaccharides. The polysac-\\ncharides, in turn, form a polymer matrix that is less\\nsusceptible to host defenses and antibiotics than is\\nthe systemic circulation. Acute osteomyelitis is char-\\nacterized by a suppurative phase, with the rapid re-\\ncruitment of inflammatory cells, tissue necrosis, and\\nobliteration of vascular channels by inflammation and\\nbacterial invasion. Subsequently, chronic microvascu-\\nlar compromise may occur, and sequestered bone may\\nbecome necrotic, with exuberant reactive bone for-\\nmation. The injection of bacteria into the blood-\\nstream in animals that have not been subjected to\\ntrauma may cause osteomyelitis, but if the bones have\\nbeen traumatized, the disease can be induced with\\nthe introduction of a much smaller number of or-\\nganisms.\\nHIV disease is associated with a number of im-\\nmune deficits that favor the development of osteomy-\\nelitis. In addition to the well-documented decrease\\nin the CD4 lymphocyte count, antigen and mitogen\\nresponses are diminished, and the activity of cyto-\\ntoxic T lymphocytes is decreased. Diminished humoral\\nresponsiveness may also make the host more suscep-\\ntible to bacteremia and serious suppurative infections.\\nThis patient was receiving trimethoprim-sulfameth-\\noxazole as prophylaxis against recurrent P. carinii\\npneumonia, but it is possible that he was not taking\\nhis medication as prescribed or that his bone lesions\\nwere due to an organism that was resistant to the\\ndrug. Other diminished immune responses to specific\\npathogens have been well documented. Thus, a pa-\\ntient with a CD4 lymphocyte count of less than 100\\ncells per cubic millimeter may be susceptible to in-\\nfection with a wide variety of organisms that have been\\nassociated with chronic osteomyelitis, including atyp-\\nical mycobacteria and fungi that disseminate.\\nThe spectrum of cases of osteomyelitis has changed.\\nThirty years ago, almost half the cases were due to\\nS. aureus infection, but the number of gram-nega-\\ntive infections subsequently increased; the number\\nof polymicrobial infections has remained large (Ta-\\nble 3).2 Because this patient was infected with HIV\\nand had used intravenous drugs, a large number of\\nmicroorganisms could have caused the Brodie's ab-\\nscess, including S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas\\naeruginosa and other gram-negative rods, and Can-\\ndida albicans (Table 4). The absence of metastatic\\nfoci and systemic manifestations suggests that the in-\\nfection was related to the patient's immunodeficient\\nstate and compromised bony microvasculature or that\\n284\\nJuly 27, 2000\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Atypical mycobacteria\\nsuch as Mycobacterium marinum, M. gordonae, M. for-\\ntuitum, and M. chelonei are endemic in the environ-\\nment in New England and have a propensity for op-\\nportunistic growth in patients with AIDS who do\\nnot inject drugs. Finally, because of the reactive scle-\\nrosis in this case, one cannot rule out the possibility\\nof an occult tumor, such as an osteogenic sarcoma, in\\nan area of suppuration and chronic scarring. How-\\never, a bone tumor is much less likely than an atypical\\ninfection in a patient with advanced HIV disease.\\nThe first step in managing osteomyelitis is to per-\\nform a bone biopsy, with cultures and staining for\\natypical mycobacteria and fungi, in order to identify\\nall possible causative organisms. This patient's infection\\ncould be due to multiple microorganisms and may\\nrequire treatment with several antimicrobial agents.\\nTreatment with antibiotics alone is not sufficient,\\nhowever, to eradicate this type of infection. Because\\nthe infected necrotic bone is poorly perfused in pa-\\ntients with chronic osteomyelitis, adequate drainage,\\nthorough débridement, prevention of dead space, re-\\nmoval of any stabilizing device (e.g., a pin or plate),\\nprotection of the wound, and specific antimicrobial\\ntherapy are all required to ensure an adequate clinical\\nresult. If possible, antibiotic agents should be with-\\nheld until the biopsy specimen has been cultured\\nand the sensitivity of the causative organisms to spe-\\ncific agents is known.\\nThe lesion should be débrided until all nonviable\\ntissue and foreign bodies have been removed. To en-\\nsure adequate antibiotic penetration and to prevent\\ncontinued sequestration, the cancellous and cortical\\nbone remaining in the wound after débridement must\\nbleed uniformly. Since it takes at least three or four\\nweeks for bone to be revascularized after débride-\\nment, antibiotics must be administered during this\\nperiod to prevent the reactivation of microfoci of in-\\nfection. The removal of sequestered bone must be\\nfollowed by intravenous administration of antibiotics\\nfor at least six weeks in order to eradicate the micro-\\norganisms. Once the bone has been sterilized, one can\\ndecide whether a pin, plate, or other device should\\nbe used to help stabilize the bone. External stabili-\\nzation with a cast is often required for a period of\\nweeks or months before such devices can be inserted.\\nDR. ANDREW E. ROSENBERG: Since you are mak-\\ning a diagnosis of osteomyelitis, can you pinpoint\\nthe most likely causative organism?\\nDR.

FRANCIS J. HORNICEK, JR.: We considered\\nthe possibility of a malignant tumor as part of the\\ndifferential diagnosis. After the appropriate imaging\\nstudies had been performed, we concluded that an\\nopen biopsy was required. Tissue obtained from the\\nopen biopsy performed at the time of surgery was\\nsent for frozen-section examination. Curettage of the\\ncavity was performed, followed by insertion of poly-\\nmethyl methacrylate cement. The subchondral bone\\nwas intact, and no supplemental fixation was required.\\nDR. ROSENBERG: The biopsy specimen contained\\nnumerous large, necrotizing granulomas composed\\nof epithelioid histiocytes and Langhans-type giant\\ncells (Fig. 4). The granulomas had replaced the mar-\\nrow and caused resorption of the cancellous bone.\\nZiehl-Neelsen staining showed the presence of bead-\\ned acid-fast bacilli in the necrotic debris. M. avium\\ncomplex was identified in the microbiologic culture\\nof the specimen. Therefore, the diagnosis is granu-\\nlomatous osteomyelitis caused by M. avium complex.\\nMusculoskeletal infection in patients with HIV in-\\nfection is uncommon, with a prevalence of 0 to 4 per-\\ncent in large series. The types of infections have in-\\ncluded septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, septic bursitis,\\nand pyomyositis. Fewer than 50 cases of osteomyeli-\\ntis associated with HIV infection have been reported.\\nThe known risk factors for HIV infection in these\\ncases were intravenous drug use (35 percent), ho-\\nmosexuality (24 percent), and previous blood trans-\\nfusion (6 percent).3 A variety of anatomical sites were\\naffected, and approximately 21 percent of the patients\\ndied. S. aureus was considered the primary pathogen\\nin approximately 15 percent of the cases.\\nAtypical mycobacteria have been identified in 33\\nHIV-infected patients with osteomyelitis.3-6 This com-\\nplication is a late sequela of HIV infection and is usu-\\nally associated with a low CD4 cell count, since cell-\\nmediated immunity is an important defense against\\natypical mycobacteria. In the reported cases, the sites\\nof involvement included the small bones of the hands\\nand feet, the tibia, the femur, and the calvaria.3-6 Mul-\\ntiple skeletal sites or joints were affected in many cas-\\nes, and associated cutaneous lesions were common.\\nM. haemophilum was isolated on culture in 16 cases,\\nM. kansasii in 9, M. avium complex in 5, and M. avi-\\num complex and M. kansasii in 2. A regimen of mul-\\ntiple antibiotic agents has been the treatment of choice\\nfor osteomyelitis caused by infection with atypical\\nmycobacteria. The clinical course has varied, because\\nsome infections have been indolent and others have\\nbeen rapidly progressive.\\nIt is perplexing that M. avium complex is respon-\\nsible for only a small percentage of cases of osteomy-\\nelitis due to atypical mycobacteria, since this organism\\nis the most common cause of disseminated myco-\\nbacterial infection in patients with AIDS. M. avium\\nFigure 4. Granuloma Containing Langhans-Type, Multinucleat-\\ned Giant Cells (Hematoxylin and Eosin, ×500).\\ncomplex is ubiquitous; it is present in soil, natural wa-\\nter supplies, and dust. Infection usually occurs through\\ningestion or inhalation of the organism or direct in-\\noculation during trauma. In patients with AIDS,\\nM. avium complex infection is believed to be a pri-\\nmary infection rather than a reactivation of a previ-\\nous infection. In the patient under discussion, the\\ninfection may have been new or may have been as-\\nsociated with the previous fracture.\\nDR. ANGELA M. CALIENDO: Were blood cultures\\nperformed?\\nDR. ROSENBERG: Blood cultures were performed,\\nand the results were negative.\\nDR. MAYER: Dr. Rosenberg, although the infection\\nwas caused by an atypical organism, do you think\\nthat the radiographic and histopathological findings\\nare consistent with the diagnosis of Brodie's abscess?\\nThe intense inflammatory-cell reaction differs from\\nthe usual response I have seen, even in patients with\\nintact immune systems who have atypical mycobac-\\nterial disease. Such an intense inflammatory response\\nseems surprising, especially if the infection had been\\npresent for up to 12 years.\\nDR. ROSENBERG: The determination of whether\\nthis patient's lesion meets the criteria for the di-\\nagnosis of Brodie's abscess is subjective. Brodie de-\\nscribed a suppurative inflammatory infiltrate composed\\nof polymorphonuclear leukocytes, not a granuloma-\\ntous response. Patients with M. avium complex in-\\nfection usually do not have the prominent granulo-\\nmatous reaction seen in this patient. They have an\\ninfiltrate of histiocytes containing large numbers of\\nbacteria, without necrosis or granuloma formation.\\nThe reaction in this case is more characteristic of tu-\\nberculosis in an immunocompetent patient.\\n286\\nJuly 27, 2000\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

KENNETH H. MAYER*: The salient features\\nof this case are pain in the left knee of 3 months' du-\\nration; a motor vehicle accident that resulted in an\\nopen fracture of the midshaft of the left tibia 12\\nyears earlier, with subsequent healing; and a pre-\\nsumptive diagnosis of the acquired immunodeficien-\\ncy syndrome (AIDS) 3 years before admission that\\nis only presumptive because of a suspected but un-\\nconfirmed diagnosis of P. carinii pneumonia. The\\npatient now meets the criteria for AIDS of the Cen-\\nters for Disease Control and Prevention, even if the\\npneumonia was not due to P. carinii infection, since\\nhis CD4 lymphocyte count on admission to this\\nhospital was only 81 cells per cubic millimeter. The\\npatient acquired HIV infection by injecting drugs,\\nwhich also put him at risk for complications of bac-\\nteremia. On admission, however, he was afebrile, and\\nthe physical examination and laboratory tests showed\\nno signs of infection.\\nMay we review the radiologic findings?\\nDR. SUSAN V. KATTAPURAM: The bone scan ob-\\ntained after the administration of technetium-99m-\\nlabeled methylene diphosphonate (Fig. 1) shows an\\narea of increased uptake in the proximal portion of\\nthe left tibia. The center of the lesion has less uptake\\nthan the margins, where uptake is considerable. The\\nanteroposterior radiograph (Fig. 2) shows a lytic lesion\\nin the proximal lateral portion of the tibia, extend-\\ning to the subarticular margin and the metaphysis,\\nand a smaller lesion in the proximal medial portion\\nof the tibia. There is bony sclerosis between these\\ntwo lesions. The margins of the larger lesion are fair-\\nly well defined. The articular surface of the tibia is\\nintact. There is no joint effusion.\\nA proton-density-weighted coronal image from an\\nMRI scan of the tibia (Fig. 3) shows that the lesion\\nin the proximal lateral portion of the tibia has low\\nsignal intensity and is demarcated by a rim of high\\nsignal intensity, indicating edema of the marrow. The\\nmedial collateral ligament is intact, the menisci and\\nthe articular surfaces of the proximal tibia and fem-\\noral condyles are normal, and there is no evidence\\nof a soft-tissue mass. The proton-density-weighted\\naxial image shows that the lesion has a small soft-tis-\\nsue component separating the anteromedial aspect\\nof the cortex and the pes anserinus. The T2-weighted\\naxial and coronal images show areas of heterogeneous\\nsignal intensity in the lesion; the appearance of the\\nsurrounding tissue suggests the presence of reactive\\nmarrow or fibrous tissue.\\nDR. MAYER: The differential diagnosis of this case\\nis complex because the patient's injury was sustained\\n12 years earlier, resulting in the possible introduc-\\ntion of foreign material, microorganisms, or both at\\nthat time. The patient was subsequently asymptomat-\\nic, however, and the pain in his knee developed in\\nthe absence of more recent trauma. Unfortunately, his\\nHIV infection was treated with a regimen of two nu-\\ncleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, which would\\nnow be considered substandard antiretroviral therapy.\\nThe case report does not include information about\\nthe peripheral-blood viral load at the time of admis-\\nsion, so we do not know how effective these medi-\\ncations had been in suppressing the HIV infection.\\nThe history of probable P. carinii pneumonia and the\\nlow CD4 cell count, however, corroborate the pres-\\nence of severe immunosuppression.\\nOne plausible explanation of the salient features of\\nthe patient's history and the radiographic and MRI\\nevidence of localized bony destruction is that a fas-\\ntidious saprophytic organism was introduced into the\\n*Chief, Infectious Disease Division, Memorial Hospital, Pawtucket, R.I.;\\nmedical research director, Fenway Community Health Center, Boston; pro-\\nfessor of medicine and community health, Brown University, Providence, R.I.\\nVolume 343 Number 4\\n283\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

It was\\nquiescent initially but was subsequently able to rep-\\nlicate because of the failure of the patient's immune\\nsystem. It is also possible that because of scar forma-\\ntion and compromised vascularity of the bone after\\nthe accident, an organism was introduced more re-\\ncently, during an episode of asymptomatic bactere-\\nmia or fungemia, and proliferated in the hypovascu-\\nlar tissue.\\nA third possible explanation is that a microorgan-\\nism was introduced into the bone when the patient\\nwas injecting drugs, perhaps as a result of septic mi-\\ncroemboli associated with subacute bacterial endo-\\ncarditis. However, the absence of systemic manifes-\\ntations, the absence of anemia despite advanced HIV\\ninfection, and the low erythrocyte sedimentation rate\\nmake this explanation unlikely. Moreover, the lesions\\nwere found only at the site of the previous trauma,\\nwith no evidence of metastatic foci.\\nThe probable diagnosis in this case is chronic os-\\nteomyelitis - specifically, Brodie's abscess. Sir Ben-\\njamin Collins Brodie (1783–1862) was the British\\nsurgeon who first described this lesion, which is char-\\nacterized by a roughly spherical region of bony de-\\nstruction filled with purulent material, connective tis-\\nsue, or both. Patients with these localized lesions may\\npresent with a fever, but in chronic cases patients are\\nusually afebrile and have dull pain and radiologic ev-\\nidence of periosteal elevation. This patient's lesion was\\ncharacteristic of Brodie's abscess in that it involved\\nthe proximal portion of the tibia adjacent to the me-\\ntaphysis. In most cases, there is a single lesion, but\\nin this case, there may have been a secondary lesion,\\nin addition to the primary focus of involvement. The\\natypical aspect of this case is the patient's age, since\\nthree quarters of patients with Brodie's abscess are\\nless than 25 years old. The most common causative\\nagent is Staphylococcus aureus.\\nBone infections have been classified as either hem-\\natogenous or due to a contiguous focus of infec-\\ntion.1,2 The latter type has been subdivided on the\\nbasis of the presence or absence of vascular insuffi-\\nciency. In this case, there was probably some com-\\npromise of the vascular supply of the bone as a result\\nof the automobile accident. According to the radio-\\ngraphic and MRI studies, both the medullary and\\nthe periosteal blood supplies to the bone were com-\\npromised, and there were large areas of dead bone\\n(sequestra). Microorganisms can be difficult to erad-\\nicate in such areas, even if the patient has a strong\\nimmune response and is treated with surgery, anti-\\nbiotic therapy, or both. Thus, in this immunocom-\\npromised patient, a small focus of acute osteomyeli-\\ntis could have evolved into chronic disease. Features\\nof this case that are characteristic of chronic osteo-\\nmyelitis are the sequestra, scar tissue, radiographic ev-\\nidence of reactive sclerosis, adjacent soft-tissue ische-\\nmia with edema, and a progressive clinical course. The\\ncourse of osteomyelitis may be altered by host fac-\\ntors that affect immune surveillance, metabolism, and\\nlocal vascularity. In this case, HIV-associated immu-\\nnosuppression may have precipitated the reactivation\\nand progression of the infected nidus.\\nThe pathophysiologic aspects of osteomyelitis are\\ncomplex. The bone may form a substrate for the in-\\ncreased replication of infectious organisms, resulting\\nin the elaboration of polysaccharides. The polysac-\\ncharides, in turn, form a polymer matrix that is less\\nsusceptible to host defenses and antibiotics than is\\nthe systemic circulation. Acute osteomyelitis is char-\\nacterized by a suppurative phase, with the rapid re-\\ncruitment of inflammatory cells, tissue necrosis, and\\nobliteration of vascular channels by inflammation and\\nbacterial invasion. Subsequently, chronic microvascu-\\nlar compromise may occur, and sequestered bone may\\nbecome necrotic, with exuberant reactive bone for-\\nmation. The injection of bacteria into the blood-\\nstream in animals that have not been subjected to\\ntrauma may cause osteomyelitis, but if the bones have\\nbeen traumatized, the disease can be induced with\\nthe introduction of a much smaller number of or-\\nganisms.\\nHIV disease is associated with a number of im-\\nmune deficits that favor the development of osteomy-\\nelitis. In addition to the well-documented decrease\\nin the CD4 lymphocyte count, antigen and mitogen\\nresponses are diminished, and the activity of cyto-\\ntoxic T lymphocytes is decreased. Diminished humoral\\nresponsiveness may also make the host more suscep-\\ntible to bacteremia and serious suppurative infections.\\nThis patient was receiving trimethoprim-sulfameth-\\noxazole as prophylaxis against recurrent P. carinii\\npneumonia, but it is possible that he was not taking\\nhis medication as prescribed or that his bone lesions\\nwere due to an organism that was resistant to the\\ndrug. Other diminished immune responses to specific\\npathogens have been well documented. Thus, a pa-\\ntient with a CD4 lymphocyte count of less than 100\\ncells per cubic millimeter may be susceptible to in-\\nfection with a wide variety of organisms that have been\\nassociated with chronic osteomyelitis, including atyp-\\nical mycobacteria and fungi that disseminate.\\nThe spectrum of cases of osteomyelitis has changed.\\nThirty years ago, almost half the cases were due to\\nS. aureus infection, but the number of gram-nega-\\ntive infections subsequently increased; the number\\nof polymicrobial infections has remained large (Ta-\\nble 3).2 Because this patient was infected with HIV\\nand had used intravenous drugs, a large number of\\nmicroorganisms could have caused the Brodie's ab-\\nscess, including S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas\\naeruginosa and other gram-negative rods, and Can-\\ndida albicans (Table 4). The absence of metastatic\\nfoci and systemic manifestations suggests that the in-\\nfection was related to the patient's immunodeficient\\nstate and compromised bony microvasculature or that\\n284\\nJuly 27, 2000\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Atypical mycobacteria\\nsuch as Mycobacterium marinum, M. gordonae, M. for-\\ntuitum, and M. chelonei are endemic in the environ-\\nment in New England and have a propensity for op-\\nportunistic growth in patients with AIDS who do\\nnot inject drugs. Finally, because of the reactive scle-\\nrosis in this case, one cannot rule out the possibility\\nof an occult tumor, such as an osteogenic sarcoma, in\\nan area of suppuration and chronic scarring. How-\\never, a bone tumor is much less likely than an atypical\\ninfection in a patient with advanced HIV disease.\\nThe first step in managing osteomyelitis is to per-\\nform a bone biopsy, with cultures and staining for\\natypical mycobacteria and fungi, in order to identify\\nall possible causative organisms. This patient's infection\\ncould be due to multiple microorganisms and may\\nrequire treatment with several antimicrobial agents.\\nTreatment with antibiotics alone is not sufficient,\\nhowever, to eradicate this type of infection. Because\\nthe infected necrotic bone is poorly perfused in pa-\\ntients with chronic osteomyelitis, adequate drainage,\\nthorough débridement, prevention of dead space, re-\\nmoval of any stabilizing device (e.g., a pin or plate),\\nprotection of the wound, and specific antimicrobial\\ntherapy are all required to ensure an adequate clinical\\nresult. If possible, antibiotic agents should be with-\\nheld until the biopsy specimen has been cultured\\nand the sensitivity of the causative organisms to spe-\\ncific agents is known.\\nThe lesion should be débrided until all nonviable\\ntissue and foreign bodies have been removed. To en-\\nsure adequate antibiotic penetration and to prevent\\ncontinued sequestration, the cancellous and cortical\\nbone remaining in the wound after débridement must\\nbleed uniformly. Since it takes at least three or four\\nweeks for bone to be revascularized after débride-\\nment, antibiotics must be administered during this\\nperiod to prevent the reactivation of microfoci of in-\\nfection. The removal of sequestered bone must be\\nfollowed by intravenous administration of antibiotics\\nfor at least six weeks in order to eradicate the micro-\\norganisms. Once the bone has been sterilized, one can\\ndecide whether a pin, plate, or other device should\\nbe used to help stabilize the bone. External stabili-\\nzation with a cast is often required for a period of\\nweeks or months before such devices can be inserted.\\nDR. ANDREW E. ROSENBERG: Since you are mak-\\ning a diagnosis of osteomyelitis, can you pinpoint\\nthe most likely causative organism?\\nDR.

FRANCIS J. HORNICEK, JR.: We considered\\nthe possibility of a malignant tumor as part of the\\ndifferential diagnosis. After the appropriate imaging\\nstudies had been performed, we concluded that an\\nopen biopsy was required. Tissue obtained from the\\nopen biopsy performed at the time of surgery was\\nsent for frozen-section examination. Curettage of the\\ncavity was performed, followed by insertion of poly-\\nmethyl methacrylate cement. The subchondral bone\\nwas intact, and no supplemental fixation was required.\\nDR. ROSENBERG: The biopsy specimen contained\\nnumerous large, necrotizing granulomas composed\\nof epithelioid histiocytes and Langhans-type giant\\ncells (Fig. 4). The granulomas had replaced the mar-\\nrow and caused resorption of the cancellous bone.\\nZiehl-Neelsen staining showed the presence of bead-\\ned acid-fast bacilli in the necrotic debris. M. avium\\ncomplex was identified in the microbiologic culture\\nof the specimen. Therefore, the diagnosis is granu-\\nlomatous osteomyelitis caused by M. avium complex.\\nMusculoskeletal infection in patients with HIV in-\\nfection is uncommon, with a prevalence of 0 to 4 per-\\ncent in large series. The types of infections have in-\\ncluded septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, septic bursitis,\\nand pyomyositis. Fewer than 50 cases of osteomyeli-\\ntis associated with HIV infection have been reported.\\nThe known risk factors for HIV infection in these\\ncases were intravenous drug use (35 percent), ho-\\nmosexuality (24 percent), and previous blood trans-\\nfusion (6 percent).3 A variety of anatomical sites were\\naffected, and approximately 21 percent of the patients\\ndied. S. aureus was considered the primary pathogen\\nin approximately 15 percent of the cases.\\nAtypical mycobacteria have been identified in 33\\nHIV-infected patients with osteomyelitis.3-6 This com-\\nplication is a late sequela of HIV infection and is usu-\\nally associated with a low CD4 cell count, since cell-\\nmediated immunity is an important defense against\\natypical mycobacteria. In the reported cases, the sites\\nof involvement included the small bones of the hands\\nand feet, the tibia, the femur, and the calvaria.3-6 Mul-\\ntiple skeletal sites or joints were affected in many cas-\\nes, and associated cutaneous lesions were common.\\nM. haemophilum was isolated on culture in 16 cases,\\nM. kansasii in 9, M. avium complex in 5, and M. avi-\\num complex and M. kansasii in 2. A regimen of mul-\\ntiple antibiotic agents has been the treatment of choice\\nfor osteomyelitis caused by infection with atypical\\nmycobacteria. The clinical course has varied, because\\nsome infections have been indolent and others have\\nbeen rapidly progressive.\\nIt is perplexing that M. avium complex is respon-\\nsible for only a small percentage of cases of osteomy-\\nelitis due to atypical mycobacteria, since this organism\\nis the most common cause of disseminated myco-\\nbacterial infection in patients with AIDS. M. avium\\nFigure 4. Granuloma Containing Langhans-Type, Multinucleat-\\ned Giant Cells (Hematoxylin and Eosin, ×500).\\ncomplex is ubiquitous; it is present in soil, natural wa-\\nter supplies, and dust. Infection usually occurs through\\ningestion or inhalation of the organism or direct in-\\noculation during trauma. In patients with AIDS,\\nM. avium complex infection is believed to be a pri-\\nmary infection rather than a reactivation of a previ-\\nous infection. In the patient under discussion, the\\ninfection may have been new or may have been as-\\nsociated with the previous fracture.\\nDR. ANGELA M. CALIENDO: Were blood cultures\\nperformed?\\nDR. ROSENBERG: Blood cultures were performed,\\nand the results were negative.\\nDR. MAYER: Dr. Rosenberg, although the infection\\nwas caused by an atypical organism, do you think\\nthat the radiographic and histopathological findings\\nare consistent with the diagnosis of Brodie's abscess?\\nThe intense inflammatory-cell reaction differs from\\nthe usual response I have seen, even in patients with\\nintact immune systems who have atypical mycobac-\\nterial disease. Such an intense inflammatory response\\nseems surprising, especially if the infection had been\\npresent for up to 12 years.\\nDR. ROSENBERG: The determination of whether\\nthis patient's lesion meets the criteria for the di-\\nagnosis of Brodie's abscess is subjective. Brodie de-\\nscribed a suppurative inflammatory infiltrate composed\\nof polymorphonuclear leukocytes, not a granuloma-\\ntous response. Patients with M. avium complex in-\\nfection usually do not have the prominent granulo-\\nmatous reaction seen in this patient. They have an\\ninfiltrate of histiocytes containing large numbers of\\nbacteria, without necrosis or granuloma formation.\\nThe reaction in this case is more characteristic of tu-\\nberculosis in an immunocompetent patient.\\n286\\nJuly 27, 2000\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

PETERS, Editorial StaffCase 29-2000PRESENTATION OF CASEA 69-year-old woman was admitted to the hospitalbecause of weakness, cough, and low-grade fever.The patient had end-stage renal disease due tomembranous glomerulonephritis (Fig. 1 and 2) and along history of hypertension. Four years before admis-sion, after having undergone extracorporeal hemodi-alysis for three years, she received a cadaveric renaltransplant, which was rejected because of the devel-opment of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Trans-plantation of a second cadaveric kidney was performed34 months before admission. There were no episodesof rejection, and the creatinine level was approximate-ly 2 mg per deciliter (180 µmol per liter). A chest ra-diograph obtained six and a half months before admis-sion showed a cardiothoracic ratio of 16:29; the lungsappeared normal.The patient's condition was stable until one monthbefore admission, when she observed a nodule on herleft forearm, which became enlarged and painful. Tendays before admission, she began to have fatigue, an-orexia, a nonproductive cough, hoarseness, exertion-al dyspnea, and low-grade fever. She was admitted tothe hospital.The patient had lost 2 or 3 kg in weight. She hada 35-pack-year history of cigarette smoking; she hadstopped smoking 13 years before admission. Therewas no history of recent travel or exposure to ill per-sons. Her medications consisted of prednisone (15 mgdaily), cyclosporine (75 mg twice daily), mycopheno-late mofetil (1 g twice daily), omeprazole, verapamil,nifedipine, and simvastatin.The temperature was 36°C, the pulse was 107, andthe respirations were 24.

Aspiration of thenodule on the forearm yielded pus, which was sentto the laboratory for microscopical examination andculture. Treatment with mycophenolate mofetil andnifedipine was discontinued. In addition to the pa-tient's other medications, sodium bicarbonate, furo-semide, and salt-poor albumin with an infusion ofdopamine and a single intravenous dose of methyl-prednisolone (100 mg) were administered.On the second hospital day, the temperature was36.2°C. The oxygen saturation was 91 percent whilethe patient was breathing ambient air, and supplemen-tal oxygen was added. The results of laboratory testsare shown in Tables 1 and 2.A diagnostic procedure was performed.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSISDR. MARK S. DRAPKIN*: May we review the ra-diographs?DR. AMITA SHARMA: The radiograph of the chestobtained on the day of admission (Fig. 3) shows mul-tiple well-defined pulmonary nodules, 1.5 to 5.0 cm indiameter. The cardiac silhouette has increased in sizesince the radiograph obtained six and a half monthsbefore admission, and a small left-sided pleural effu-sion has appeared.The CT scan (Fig. 4) shows well-defined bilateralpulmonary nodules without calcification or cavitation,small bilateral pleural effusions, and a moderate-sizedpericardial effusion containing fibrinous strands.DR. DRAPKIN: In making a diagnosis, one can be-gin by considering the most abnormal, perhaps evenbizarre, findings, construct possible explanations foreach of them, and then try to determine where theexplanations intersect. In this case, the most abnor-mal findings are the very large pulmonary nodulesand an unusual skin lesion. I shall assume that thepulmonary nodules and the skin lesion are relatedand that a diagnosis that does not explain both find-ings is incorrect. I interpret the low-attenuation le-sions in the spleen and transplanted kidney that wereseen on the abdominal CT scan as simple cysts, al-though it is possible that they were of the same na-ture as the pulmonary and cutaneous lesions.Noninfectious processes are very unlikely explana-tions of the lung nodules in this case. The radiograph-ic appearance of the nodules does not resemble thatof pulmonary infarcts, eosinophilic pneumonia, Weg-ener's granulomatosis, bronchiolitis obliterans, or oth-er noninfectious pulmonary disorders. Pyoderma gan-grenosum and Sweet's syndrome can result in purulentskin lesions, but these disorders do not affect thelungs. The pace of the patient's illness, with clearlung fields six and a half months before admission,does not suggest carcinoma metastatic to the lung.Only an infectious process easily links the pulmonaryand cutaneous lesions.The likelihood that a particular infection will de-velop after transplantation depends on timing, epide-miologic factors, and the degree of immunosuppres-sion. 1,2 This patient's current renal graft was implantedapproximately three years before admission. A noso-comial infection, such as a wound infection, sepsisrelated to intravenous catheters, or mucosal candidi-asis, would have developed in the early period aftertransplantation, not three years later.

Although cytomegalovirus infection couldhave been in the background, contributing to the re-jection of the patient's first transplant and augment-ing her current immunosuppression, none of thefindings support this possibility. A post-transplanta-tion lymphoproliferative disorder associated with Ep-stein-Barr virus infection can result in pulmonarynodules, but they are generally smaller than those inthis case, and other manifestations of a lymphoprolif-erative disorder are absent.There are no epidemiologic clues in this case.Travel to the Southwest, which might suggest coc-cidioidomycosis, is not mentioned, nor is travel tothe Midwest, which might raise the possibility ofhistoplasmosis. Disseminated strongyloidiasis is rarein persons who have not traveled outside the North-east. There is also no mention of contact with hors-es, which might suggest rhodococcus infection.With regard to the degree of the patient's immu-nosuppression, her medication regimen is standard forimmunosuppressive therapy three years after transplan-tation. The dose of prednisone (15 mg daily) is a littlehigher than usual5 perhaps high enough to encour-age moderately aggressive opportunistic organisms.What pathogen caused this patient's lesion? Rubinand Greene found that 10 of 36 pulmonary infec-tions in transplant recipients were due to commonbacterial pathogens. A subacute bacterial infection ofthe skin, perhaps caused by Staphylococcus aureus,could have involved a vein or even a right-sided car-diac valve in this patient, with embolism to the lungsand skin, linking the pulmonary and cutaneous le-sions. If this had happened, however, the pulmonarynodules would have undergone cavitation long ago,the patient's fever would have been hectic, she wouldhave appeared much more acutely ill, and her coughwould have produced sputum; a venous cord mighthave been palpable, and a murmur might have beenaudible. No commonplace bacterial infection wouldexplain this patient's illness.Nine of the infections in the series described byRubin and Greene were viral, but a viral infectionwould not be a reasonable explanation for the nod-ular lesions in this case. Two of the infections in thatseries were due to Pneumocystis carinii, which canproduce small pulmonary nodules but not hugeones and which rarely involves the skin as the onlyapparent site of dissemination.Infection with Bartonella henselae has caused pul-monary nodules in a renal-transplant recipient.7 Theinfection commonly causes skin lesions, which occurin the form of bacillary angiomatosis in patients withhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, butthese lesions do not match the description of the le-sion on this patient's forearm.Tuberculous or other mycobacterial infections oc-cur in transplant recipients much more often than inthe general population, and they can involve the lungsand skin. Multiple large pulmonary nodules have notbeen described in several series of cases,9-13 however,and if this patient had a mycobacterial infection, thenodules would have undergone cavitation by this pointin the course of the illness.Elimination of the infections I have discussed leavessix cases of fungal infection and eight of nocardial in-fection in the series described by Rubin and Greene.Indeed, these authors state that space-occupying non-anatomical infiltrates “usually are a sign of fungal ornocardial disease.”I have already dismissed the geographically limitedfungi, since none of them are endemic in Massachu-setts. Yeast forms were seen on urinalysis, but a di-agnosis of disseminated candidiasis is very unlikely.Pulmonary disease due to candida is almost alwayshematogenous and has a patchy or miliary-nodularradiographic pattern, without large nodules.14 Thereis no evidence of monilia infection in this patient, shehas not recently received antibiotics, she does not haveneutropenia, she has not been receiving intravenousalimentation, and she has not recently had any intra-venous devices. All these factors make the presence ofcandidiasis unlikely.14,15 The degree of immunosup-pression in this patient and the leukocytosis are notcharacteristic of aspergillosis or pseudallescheriasis.Cryptococcus neoformans infection is a possible di-agnosis in this case. The ubiquitous fungus is usuallyassociated with droppings from birds, especially pi-geons. Their internal temperature (41.5° to 43.3° C)is too high to permit growth of the fungus, but theirexcreta may provide a rich nitrogenous substrate forthe growth of fungi that are already present in soil.16Fraser et al.17 have described four radiographic pat-terns of pulmonary cryptococcosis: consolidation;widely disseminated miliary nodules (1 to 2 mm indiameter); an interstitial infiltrate; and well-definednodules, which are 2 to 10 cm in diameter, usuallysolitary, and often pleural and which cavitate onlyoccasionally (in 16 of 101 cases in one series18). In aseries of HIV-negative Australian patients with cryp-tococcosis, solitary or multiple pulmonary noduleswere larger than 5 mm in diameter and often muchlarger.19 In contrast, interstitial infiltrates or pleuraleffusions were the usual radiographic manifestationsof cryptococcal pulmonary infection in a series ofpatients without HIV infection; none of the patientshad multiple pulmonary nodules.20 In many patientswith cryptococcal disease, the pulmonary changesoccur early in the course of the illness and are notdetected initially. Meningitis is the most common in-fection at the time of presentation.15Cryptococcus can also infect the skin in the formof ulcers, acneiform papules or pustules, subcutaneousswellings, granulomas, gumma-like lesions, abscesses,Volume 343 Number 12873The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on August 3, 2025.Copyright © 2000 Massachusetts Medical Society.

One of the aerobic acti-nomycetes, nocardia is characterized by branching fil-aments, with variable results on acid-fast staining andvariable or positive results on Gram's staining. Foundin soil and vegetation, the organism usually infects hu-mans by the respiratory route. As a result, pulmonaryinfection is the most common form of disease, withhematogenous spread to other organs possible, espe-cially in immunocompromised persons.28A review of CT findings in cases of pulmonarynocardiosis 29 showed that nodules were present in79 percent of the cases. Although the nodules oftenappeared to be solitary on radiographs of the chest,CT scanning usually showed multiple nodules. Twen-ty-one percent of the patients without HIV infectionhad multiple nodules. These lesions may be smoothand rounded or irregularly shaped, pleural or central,and cavitary or solid. They may be associated withpleural effusions. In another study, 30 CT scoutingshowed a nodule abutting the cardiac border (a find-ing the author thought was suggestive of transpleuralextension) in one patient and extension to the chestwall in another.In a series of 1255 renal-transplant recipients whohad been given cyclosporine, 31 there were 9 cases ofnocardial infection, 3 of which occurred late threeto five years after transplantation. One patient, inwhom the infection occurred 165 days after transplan-tation, had multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules. Twopatients had skin lesions; in one of them, the skin le-sion appeared four months after the diagnosis of no-cardiosis. Nocardiosis developed in 9 of 500 renal-transplant recipients in Brazil: all 9 had pulmonaryinvolvement, 3 had cutaneous abscesses, and 1 hadpericarditis. 32 Pericarditis due to nocardia was alsoreported in a patient who was receiving prednisoloneand cyclophosphamide.33 The author noted that fiveof eight previously reported cases of nocardia peri-carditis had resulted in pericardial tamponade. Copi-ous pus in the pericardial cavity and a densely adher-ent pericardium were found at surgery in anotherpatient with nocardia pericarditis.34Skin involvement by nocardia can take several forms.Primary cutaneous infection may follow skin injuryfrom thorns,31 insect bites, 35 and even cat scratches.36,37In the tropics, nocardia species other than asteroidescan cause mycetoma.28 A lymphocutaneous form ofinvolvement similar to sporotrichosis has also beenreported. 38,39 Hematogenous dissemination to theskin, in the form of cellulitis, nodules, or, as in thepresent case, abscesses, probably occurs more oftenthan primary infection of the skin.40 Nocardial infec-tion of the urinary tract has also been reported.41,42What accounts for the dysfunction of the renalgraft in this patient? One possible cause is a focal ordiffuse infection of the transplanted kidney with thedisseminated organism.43 A nonspecific response tosepsis and the cytokines associated with it or reacti-vation of cytomegalovirus infection may have had arole. Among noninfectious disorders, Wegener's gran-ulomatosis could explain the renal insufficiency, butif the patient had Wegener's granulomatosis, cavita-tion of the large lung lesions would be expected,and the skin lesion would remain a mystery.Did the patient's cutaneous or pulmonary lesionsdevelop first? Although she initially noticed the skinlesion, I believe her infection spread from the lungsto the skin, in view of the severity and extent of thelung disease and her weight loss. The process alsospread to the pleura and pericardium, without caus-ing constriction or tamponade.The two main diagnostic considerations in this caseare nocardiosis and cryptococcosis. Although the find-ing of yeast in the urine is consistent with the diag-nosis of cryptococcosis, the absence of a high tem-perature and the presence of granulocytic leukocytosisand pericarditis are not. The diagnosis of cryptococ-cosis depends on the demonstration of the organismin specimens of material from the skin or chest orthe finding of cryptococcal antigen in the serum.Nocardial infection is the more likely of the two di-agnoses. The diagnostic procedure may have been as-piration of pus from the skin lesion, although a biopsyof the lesion may have been performed, and the spec-imen may have revealed organisms with the branching,filamentous features characteristic of nocardia, withpositive or variable results on Gram's staining andweakly positive results on acid-fast staining. If the di-agnosis could not be made from the skin lesion, ex-amination of the thorax either bronchoscopically orthoracoscopically would have been necessary. Thediagnosis could then have been confirmed by culture,although the organism may grow slowly and in somecases does not grow at all. 28Nocardial infection responds well to treatment withsulfonamides, minocycline, amikacin, or imipenem.44Pericardiectomy may ultimately have been requiredin the case under discussion, but in the absence ofsigns of constriction or tamponade, medical therapyalone may have been effective.DR.

DRAPKIN: The nodularity of the pulmonarylesions is consistent with the presence of legionella in-fection, but the patient did not appear to be as ill asI would expect with that infection.DR. ROBERT H. RUBIN: Our long-term survivorsof transplantation fall into three groups.2,45 The pa-tients in the first group (80 percent of the total) re-main well and have good allograft function. Any in-fections in this group are mainly community-acquiredrespiratory tract infections and other infections thatare usually circulating in the community. The patientsin the second group, who account for about 10 per-cent of the total, have chronic viral infection. Thepatients in the third group, in which this patient be-longs, have had too much short- and long-term im-munosuppressive therapy because of allograft injury.They often have chronic viral infection and are athigher risk for opportunistic infection than any othergroup of transplant recipients.We thought two features of this patient's illness,in addition to the chest lesions, were notable. The firstwas the cutaneous lesion. In our experience, 25 per-cent of patients with nocardial or fungal infectionhave skin lesions as the first manifestation of the in-fection.46,47 Skin lesions are invariably the result ofdissemination and provide an accessible diagnostic site.The second notable feature was the pericardial andpleural involvement, with effusion. In our experiencewith nocardiosis, the pleural space, the pericardialspace, or both were involved in over half the cases;such involvement is less common with other infec-tions in the differential diagnosis.Another factor to consider is that 10 percent ofrenal-allograft recipients have dual infections. For ex-ample, we have seen a number of patients with simul-taneous cryptococcal and nocardial infections.One final point is that we recommend lifetime pro-phylactic treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethox-azole for patients such as this one, since they are athigh risk for opportunistic infections. This regimen isvery effective in preventing infection with nocardia,listeria, pneumocystis, and possibly toxoplasma.48We considered the same differential diagnosis thatDr. Drapkin described. The pleural and pericardialinvolvement was an important finding that led us todiagnose nocardiosis, with cryptococcosis as our sec-ond choice.CLINICAL DIAGNOSISDisseminated nocardiosis.DR. MARK S. DRAPKIN'S DIAGNOSESNocardiosis of the lungs, skin, pleura, and pericar-dium.Renal-graft insufficiency due to systemic infectionand possibly to renal nocardiosis.PATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONDR. EUGENE J. MARK: The diagnostic procedurewas a needle aspiration of the skin lesion on the dayof admission, followed by pericardiocentesis on thenext day. Gram's staining of smears of both specimensshowed long, thin, branching, weakly acid-fast fila-ments and rods. Cultures of both specimens yieldednocardia.On the eighth hospital day, signs and symptomsof early cardiac tamponade developed. An echocardio-graphic study confirmed its presence. An urgent left-sided thoracotomy revealed a large serous effusion inthe hemithorax, which was drained. The pericardialcavity was tense and bulging. When the pericardiumwas incised, cloudy, bloody fluid gushed out. Boththe parietal and the visceral pericardium were coveredwith shaggy, fibrinopurulent exudate. The thick peri-cardium (Fig. 5) was removed, the area was irrigatedwith saline, and drainage tubes were placed in thepleural space and on the anterior and diaphragmaticsurfaces of the heart.Microscopical examination showed the presence ofan organizing, acute fibrinopurulent pericarditis. Un-organized fibrin, neutrophils, and nuclear dust werepresent on the serosal surface (Fig. 6). Nocardia growsas delicate filaments that eventually break down intopleomorphic coccobacilli. The filaments are seen bestin tissue with methenamine silver stain (Fig. 7) andGram's stain and are seen less well with periodicacid-Schiff and acid-fast stains. We assiduously exam-ined slides with all these stains but could not detectthe filaments.In addition to occurring in immunosuppressedpatients, nocardial infection can occur in otherwisehealthy persons49-51 and in persons with chronic lungdisease, cancer, and several other diseases.52-54 Casesof necrotizing nocardial pneumonia in renal-allograftrecipients have been reported previously in this fo-Figure 5.

RUBIN: When one diagnoses an opportunis-tic infection, it is essential to determine the extent ofthe disease. In this case, we looked for metastaticspread to the brain, bones, and other likely sites. Thereason I emphasize this point is that the extent ofthe disease affects the course of therapy. Optimal ther-apy should be continued until all evidence of bothprimary and metastatic disease has disappeared, andthen one should administer additional therapy as a“buffer.”48 This patient has tolerated trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy well. We plan to adminis-ter this treatment at the full dose until all evidenceof the disease has disappeared and then to adminis-ter a low dose, not just as a suppressive regimen forthe nocardial infection but also as prophylaxis againstother infections.We favored a pericardiectomy in this patient be-Figure 7.

PETERS, Editorial StaffCase 29-2000PRESENTATION OF CASEA 69-year-old woman was admitted to the hospitalbecause of weakness, cough, and low-grade fever.The patient had end-stage renal disease due tomembranous glomerulonephritis (Fig. 1 and 2) and along history of hypertension. Four years before admis-sion, after having undergone extracorporeal hemodi-alysis for three years, she received a cadaveric renaltransplant, which was rejected because of the devel-opment of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Trans-plantation of a second cadaveric kidney was performed34 months before admission. There were no episodesof rejection, and the creatinine level was approximate-ly 2 mg per deciliter (180 µmol per liter). A chest ra-diograph obtained six and a half months before admis-sion showed a cardiothoracic ratio of 16:29; the lungsappeared normal.The patient's condition was stable until one monthbefore admission, when she observed a nodule on herleft forearm, which became enlarged and painful. Tendays before admission, she began to have fatigue, an-orexia, a nonproductive cough, hoarseness, exertion-al dyspnea, and low-grade fever. She was admitted tothe hospital.The patient had lost 2 or 3 kg in weight. She hada 35-pack-year history of cigarette smoking; she hadstopped smoking 13 years before admission. Therewas no history of recent travel or exposure to ill per-sons. Her medications consisted of prednisone (15 mgdaily), cyclosporine (75 mg twice daily), mycopheno-late mofetil (1 g twice daily), omeprazole, verapamil,nifedipine, and simvastatin.The temperature was 36°C, the pulse was 107, andthe respirations were 24.

The oxygen saturation was 91 percent whilethe patient was breathing ambient air, and supplemen-tal oxygen was added. The results of laboratory testsare shown in Tables 1 and 2.A diagnostic procedure was performed.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSISDR. MARK S. DRAPKIN*: May we review the ra-diographs?DR. AMITA SHARMA: The radiograph of the chestobtained on the day of admission (Fig. 3) shows mul-tiple well-defined pulmonary nodules, 1.5 to 5.0 cm indiameter. The cardiac silhouette has increased in sizesince the radiograph obtained six and a half monthsbefore admission, and a small left-sided pleural effu-sion has appeared.The CT scan (Fig. 4) shows well-defined bilateralpulmonary nodules without calcification or cavitation,small bilateral pleural effusions, and a moderate-sizedpericardial effusion containing fibrinous strands.DR. DRAPKIN: In making a diagnosis, one can be-gin by considering the most abnormal, perhaps evenbizarre, findings, construct possible explanations foreach of them, and then try to determine where theexplanations intersect. In this case, the most abnor-mal findings are the very large pulmonary nodulesand an unusual skin lesion. I shall assume that thepulmonary nodules and the skin lesion are relatedand that a diagnosis that does not explain both find-ings is incorrect. I interpret the low-attenuation le-sions in the spleen and transplanted kidney that wereseen on the abdominal CT scan as simple cysts, al-though it is possible that they were of the same na-ture as the pulmonary and cutaneous lesions.Noninfectious processes are very unlikely explana-tions of the lung nodules in this case. The radiograph-ic appearance of the nodules does not resemble thatof pulmonary infarcts, eosinophilic pneumonia, Weg-ener's granulomatosis, bronchiolitis obliterans, or oth-er noninfectious pulmonary disorders. Pyoderma gan-grenosum and Sweet's syndrome can result in purulentskin lesions, but these disorders do not affect thelungs. The pace of the patient's illness, with clearlung fields six and a half months before admission,does not suggest carcinoma metastatic to the lung.Only an infectious process easily links the pulmonaryand cutaneous lesions.The likelihood that a particular infection will de-velop after transplantation depends on timing, epide-miologic factors, and the degree of immunosuppres-sion. 1,2 This patient's current renal graft was implantedapproximately three years before admission. A noso-comial infection, such as a wound infection, sepsisrelated to intravenous catheters, or mucosal candidi-asis, would have developed in the early period aftertransplantation, not three years later.

Although cytomegalovirus infection couldhave been in the background, contributing to the re-jection of the patient's first transplant and augment-ing her current immunosuppression, none of thefindings support this possibility. A post-transplanta-tion lymphoproliferative disorder associated with Ep-stein-Barr virus infection can result in pulmonarynodules, but they are generally smaller than those inthis case, and other manifestations of a lymphoprolif-erative disorder are absent.There are no epidemiologic clues in this case.Travel to the Southwest, which might suggest coc-cidioidomycosis, is not mentioned, nor is travel tothe Midwest, which might raise the possibility ofhistoplasmosis. Disseminated strongyloidiasis is rarein persons who have not traveled outside the North-east. There is also no mention of contact with hors-es, which might suggest rhodococcus infection.With regard to the degree of the patient's immu-nosuppression, her medication regimen is standard forimmunosuppressive therapy three years after transplan-tation. The dose of prednisone (15 mg daily) is a littlehigher than usual5 perhaps high enough to encour-age moderately aggressive opportunistic organisms.What pathogen caused this patient's lesion? Rubinand Greene found that 10 of 36 pulmonary infec-tions in transplant recipients were due to commonbacterial pathogens. A subacute bacterial infection ofthe skin, perhaps caused by Staphylococcus aureus,could have involved a vein or even a right-sided car-diac valve in this patient, with embolism to the lungsand skin, linking the pulmonary and cutaneous le-sions. If this had happened, however, the pulmonarynodules would have undergone cavitation long ago,the patient's fever would have been hectic, she wouldhave appeared much more acutely ill, and her coughwould have produced sputum; a venous cord mighthave been palpable, and a murmur might have beenaudible. No commonplace bacterial infection wouldexplain this patient's illness.Nine of the infections in the series described byRubin and Greene were viral, but a viral infectionwould not be a reasonable explanation for the nod-ular lesions in this case. Two of the infections in thatseries were due to Pneumocystis carinii, which canproduce small pulmonary nodules but not hugeones and which rarely involves the skin as the onlyapparent site of dissemination.Infection with Bartonella henselae has caused pul-monary nodules in a renal-transplant recipient.7 Theinfection commonly causes skin lesions, which occurin the form of bacillary angiomatosis in patients withhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, butthese lesions do not match the description of the le-sion on this patient's forearm.Tuberculous or other mycobacterial infections oc-cur in transplant recipients much more often than inthe general population, and they can involve the lungsand skin. Multiple large pulmonary nodules have notbeen described in several series of cases,9-13 however,and if this patient had a mycobacterial infection, thenodules would have undergone cavitation by this pointin the course of the illness.Elimination of the infections I have discussed leavessix cases of fungal infection and eight of nocardial in-fection in the series described by Rubin and Greene.Indeed, these authors state that space-occupying non-anatomical infiltrates “usually are a sign of fungal ornocardial disease.”I have already dismissed the geographically limitedfungi, since none of them are endemic in Massachu-setts. Yeast forms were seen on urinalysis, but a di-agnosis of disseminated candidiasis is very unlikely.Pulmonary disease due to candida is almost alwayshematogenous and has a patchy or miliary-nodularradiographic pattern, without large nodules.14 Thereis no evidence of monilia infection in this patient, shehas not recently received antibiotics, she does not haveneutropenia, she has not been receiving intravenousalimentation, and she has not recently had any intra-venous devices. All these factors make the presence ofcandidiasis unlikely.14,15 The degree of immunosup-pression in this patient and the leukocytosis are notcharacteristic of aspergillosis or pseudallescheriasis.Cryptococcus neoformans infection is a possible di-agnosis in this case. The ubiquitous fungus is usuallyassociated with droppings from birds, especially pi-geons. Their internal temperature (41.5° to 43.3° C)is too high to permit growth of the fungus, but theirexcreta may provide a rich nitrogenous substrate forthe growth of fungi that are already present in soil.16Fraser et al.17 have described four radiographic pat-terns of pulmonary cryptococcosis: consolidation;widely disseminated miliary nodules (1 to 2 mm indiameter); an interstitial infiltrate; and well-definednodules, which are 2 to 10 cm in diameter, usuallysolitary, and often pleural and which cavitate onlyoccasionally (in 16 of 101 cases in one series18). In aseries of HIV-negative Australian patients with cryp-tococcosis, solitary or multiple pulmonary noduleswere larger than 5 mm in diameter and often muchlarger.19 In contrast, interstitial infiltrates or pleuraleffusions were the usual radiographic manifestationsof cryptococcal pulmonary infection in a series ofpatients without HIV infection; none of the patientshad multiple pulmonary nodules.20 In many patientswith cryptococcal disease, the pulmonary changesoccur early in the course of the illness and are notdetected initially. Meningitis is the most common in-fection at the time of presentation.15Cryptococcus can also infect the skin in the formof ulcers, acneiform papules or pustules, subcutaneousswellings, granulomas, gumma-like lesions, abscesses,Volume 343 Number 12873The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on August 3, 2025.Copyright © 2000 Massachusetts Medical Society.

One of the aerobic acti-nomycetes, nocardia is characterized by branching fil-aments, with variable results on acid-fast staining andvariable or positive results on Gram's staining. Foundin soil and vegetation, the organism usually infects hu-mans by the respiratory route. As a result, pulmonaryinfection is the most common form of disease, withhematogenous spread to other organs possible, espe-cially in immunocompromised persons.28A review of CT findings in cases of pulmonarynocardiosis 29 showed that nodules were present in79 percent of the cases. Although the nodules oftenappeared to be solitary on radiographs of the chest,CT scanning usually showed multiple nodules. Twen-ty-one percent of the patients without HIV infectionhad multiple nodules. These lesions may be smoothand rounded or irregularly shaped, pleural or central,and cavitary or solid. They may be associated withpleural effusions. In another study, 30 CT scoutingshowed a nodule abutting the cardiac border (a find-ing the author thought was suggestive of transpleuralextension) in one patient and extension to the chestwall in another.In a series of 1255 renal-transplant recipients whohad been given cyclosporine, 31 there were 9 cases ofnocardial infection, 3 of which occurred late threeto five years after transplantation. One patient, inwhom the infection occurred 165 days after transplan-tation, had multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules. Twopatients had skin lesions; in one of them, the skin le-sion appeared four months after the diagnosis of no-cardiosis. Nocardiosis developed in 9 of 500 renal-transplant recipients in Brazil: all 9 had pulmonaryinvolvement, 3 had cutaneous abscesses, and 1 hadpericarditis. 32 Pericarditis due to nocardia was alsoreported in a patient who was receiving prednisoloneand cyclophosphamide.33 The author noted that fiveof eight previously reported cases of nocardia peri-carditis had resulted in pericardial tamponade. Copi-ous pus in the pericardial cavity and a densely adher-ent pericardium were found at surgery in anotherpatient with nocardia pericarditis.34Skin involvement by nocardia can take several forms.Primary cutaneous infection may follow skin injuryfrom thorns,31 insect bites, 35 and even cat scratches.36,37In the tropics, nocardia species other than asteroidescan cause mycetoma.28 A lymphocutaneous form ofinvolvement similar to sporotrichosis has also beenreported. 38,39 Hematogenous dissemination to theskin, in the form of cellulitis, nodules, or, as in thepresent case, abscesses, probably occurs more oftenthan primary infection of the skin.40 Nocardial infec-tion of the urinary tract has also been reported.41,42What accounts for the dysfunction of the renalgraft in this patient? One possible cause is a focal ordiffuse infection of the transplanted kidney with thedisseminated organism.43 A nonspecific response tosepsis and the cytokines associated with it or reacti-vation of cytomegalovirus infection may have had arole. Among noninfectious disorders, Wegener's gran-ulomatosis could explain the renal insufficiency, butif the patient had Wegener's granulomatosis, cavita-tion of the large lung lesions would be expected,and the skin lesion would remain a mystery.Did the patient's cutaneous or pulmonary lesionsdevelop first? Although she initially noticed the skinlesion, I believe her infection spread from the lungsto the skin, in view of the severity and extent of thelung disease and her weight loss. The process alsospread to the pleura and pericardium, without caus-ing constriction or tamponade.The two main diagnostic considerations in this caseare nocardiosis and cryptococcosis. Although the find-ing of yeast in the urine is consistent with the diag-nosis of cryptococcosis, the absence of a high tem-perature and the presence of granulocytic leukocytosisand pericarditis are not. The diagnosis of cryptococ-cosis depends on the demonstration of the organismin specimens of material from the skin or chest orthe finding of cryptococcal antigen in the serum.Nocardial infection is the more likely of the two di-agnoses. The diagnostic procedure may have been as-piration of pus from the skin lesion, although a biopsyof the lesion may have been performed, and the spec-imen may have revealed organisms with the branching,filamentous features characteristic of nocardia, withpositive or variable results on Gram's staining andweakly positive results on acid-fast staining. If the di-agnosis could not be made from the skin lesion, ex-amination of the thorax either bronchoscopically orthoracoscopically would have been necessary. Thediagnosis could then have been confirmed by culture,although the organism may grow slowly and in somecases does not grow at all. 28Nocardial infection responds well to treatment withsulfonamides, minocycline, amikacin, or imipenem.44Pericardiectomy may ultimately have been requiredin the case under discussion, but in the absence ofsigns of constriction or tamponade, medical therapyalone may have been effective.DR.

DRAPKIN: The nodularity of the pulmonarylesions is consistent with the presence of legionella in-fection, but the patient did not appear to be as ill asI would expect with that infection.DR. ROBERT H. RUBIN: Our long-term survivorsof transplantation fall into three groups.2,45 The pa-tients in the first group (80 percent of the total) re-main well and have good allograft function. Any in-fections in this group are mainly community-acquiredrespiratory tract infections and other infections thatare usually circulating in the community. The patientsin the second group, who account for about 10 per-cent of the total, have chronic viral infection. Thepatients in the third group, in which this patient be-longs, have had too much short- and long-term im-munosuppressive therapy because of allograft injury.They often have chronic viral infection and are athigher risk for opportunistic infection than any othergroup of transplant recipients.We thought two features of this patient's illness,in addition to the chest lesions, were notable. The firstwas the cutaneous lesion. In our experience, 25 per-cent of patients with nocardial or fungal infectionhave skin lesions as the first manifestation of the in-fection.46,47 Skin lesions are invariably the result ofdissemination and provide an accessible diagnostic site.The second notable feature was the pericardial andpleural involvement, with effusion. In our experiencewith nocardiosis, the pleural space, the pericardialspace, or both were involved in over half the cases;such involvement is less common with other infec-tions in the differential diagnosis.Another factor to consider is that 10 percent ofrenal-allograft recipients have dual infections. For ex-ample, we have seen a number of patients with simul-taneous cryptococcal and nocardial infections.One final point is that we recommend lifetime pro-phylactic treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethox-azole for patients such as this one, since they are athigh risk for opportunistic infections. This regimen isvery effective in preventing infection with nocardia,listeria, pneumocystis, and possibly toxoplasma.48We considered the same differential diagnosis thatDr. Drapkin described. The pleural and pericardialinvolvement was an important finding that led us todiagnose nocardiosis, with cryptococcosis as our sec-ond choice.CLINICAL DIAGNOSISDisseminated nocardiosis.DR. MARK S. DRAPKIN'S DIAGNOSESNocardiosis of the lungs, skin, pleura, and pericar-dium.Renal-graft insufficiency due to systemic infectionand possibly to renal nocardiosis.PATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONDR. EUGENE J. MARK: The diagnostic procedurewas a needle aspiration of the skin lesion on the dayof admission, followed by pericardiocentesis on thenext day. Gram's staining of smears of both specimensshowed long, thin, branching, weakly acid-fast fila-ments and rods. Cultures of both specimens yieldednocardia.On the eighth hospital day, signs and symptomsof early cardiac tamponade developed. An echocardio-graphic study confirmed its presence. An urgent left-sided thoracotomy revealed a large serous effusion inthe hemithorax, which was drained. The pericardialcavity was tense and bulging. When the pericardiumwas incised, cloudy, bloody fluid gushed out. Boththe parietal and the visceral pericardium were coveredwith shaggy, fibrinopurulent exudate. The thick peri-cardium (Fig. 5) was removed, the area was irrigatedwith saline, and drainage tubes were placed in thepleural space and on the anterior and diaphragmaticsurfaces of the heart.Microscopical examination showed the presence ofan organizing, acute fibrinopurulent pericarditis. Un-organized fibrin, neutrophils, and nuclear dust werepresent on the serosal surface (Fig. 6). Nocardia growsas delicate filaments that eventually break down intopleomorphic coccobacilli. The filaments are seen bestin tissue with methenamine silver stain (Fig. 7) andGram's stain and are seen less well with periodicacid-Schiff and acid-fast stains. We assiduously exam-ined slides with all these stains but could not detectthe filaments.In addition to occurring in immunosuppressedpatients, nocardial infection can occur in otherwisehealthy persons49-51 and in persons with chronic lungdisease, cancer, and several other diseases.52-54 Casesof necrotizing nocardial pneumonia in renal-allograftrecipients have been reported previously in this fo-Figure 5.

RUBIN: When one diagnoses an opportunis-tic infection, it is essential to determine the extent ofthe disease. In this case, we looked for metastaticspread to the brain, bones, and other likely sites. Thereason I emphasize this point is that the extent ofthe disease affects the course of therapy. Optimal ther-apy should be continued until all evidence of bothprimary and metastatic disease has disappeared, andthen one should administer additional therapy as a“buffer.”48 This patient has tolerated trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy well. We plan to adminis-ter this treatment at the full dose until all evidenceof the disease has disappeared and then to adminis-ter a low dose, not just as a suppressive regimen forthe nocardial infection but also as prophylaxis againstother infections.We favored a pericardiectomy in this patient be-Figure 7.

Be concise and grounded.\\n\\n# PATIENT CASE\\nA 47-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of bronchopulmonary disease.\\nSix years before admission, pneumonia had developed, and asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had been diagnosed. Thereafter, the patient had pneumonia and sinusitis at least twice a year. Three years before admission, hypogammaglobulinemia was detected. Immune globulin was administered intravenously every 6 weeks, resulting in fewer bouts of pneumonia, until 14 months before admission, when the infusions were no longer approved by her insurer. The patient was able to climb stairs and to take 45-minute walks while taking prednisone (5 mg daily).\\nThirty-seven days before admission, the patient entered another hospital with an exacerbation of bronchoconstriction. On physical examination, she was afebrile; rhonchi and wheezes were heard. The white-cell count was 12,500 per cubic millimeter. Blood gases were evaluated (Table 1). Treatment with methylprednisolone (30 mg every eight hours), ceftizoxime, and trovafloxacin was ineffective. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses showed an air-fluid level in the right maxillary antrum. Ciprofloxacin and clindamycin were substituted for the other medications. A sputum culture yielded yeasts and pseudomonas. Aztreonam and fluconazole were administered, and clindamycin was discontinued. Atrial fibrillation developed. Two noninvasive studies showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis of the legs. A myocardial infarct was ruled out. A cardiac ultrasonographic study revealed normal left ventricular function, right ventricular dilatation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation; the calculated pulmonary-artery systolic pressure was 53 to 60 mm Hg. The rhythm reverted to normal spontaneously, but atrial fibrillation recurred intermittently thereafter.\\nOn the 18th hospital day, fluconazole was discontinued. On the 27th day, blood gases were analyzed (Table 1). A thoracic CT scan showed consolidation in the right middle lobe. Two days later, bronchoscopic examination revealed scanty purulent tan secretions, slight reddening of both main bronchi, erythema and edema of more distal airways, and streaks of blood in the lingular airways. Culture of bronchoalveolar washings yielded methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and candida; cytologic examination showed no abnormalities. Vancomycin was administered. Four days later, the patient's temperature rose to 38.3°C, and a radiograph revealed a new density in the right upper lobe. On the 37th day, blood gases were analyzed (Table 1). Her medications at that time included ceftazidime, vancomycin, furosemide, digoxin, enalapril, diltiazem, beclomethasone nasal spray, nebulized albuterol, nebulized ipratropium, and dornase alfa. She was transferred to this hospital.\\nThe patient had a history of hypertension with cardiomegaly and corticosteroid myopathy, as well as a 45-pack-year history of cigarette smoking, which she had discontinued six years before admission. Her father had died of emphysema, and her mother of hypertension. Several of her children had asthma.\\nThe temperature was 38.4°C, the pulse was 93, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was markedly obese, with moon facies and abdominal striae. Bilateral pulmonary crackles were heard. The heart sounds were normal. There was peripheral edema (+++).\\nThe urine was positive (+) for protein; the sediment contained 20 to 50 red cells and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 2, 3, and 4), and blood gases were analyzed (Table 1). A radiograph of the chest (Fig. 1) showed air-space opacities at the bases of both lungs.\\nSpecimens of blood, sputum, and stool were obtained for culture. Minidose heparin, digoxin, ceftazidime, levofloxacin, fluconazole, vancomycin, enalapril, albuterol, ipratropium, furosemide, and ranitidine were administered. Subsequent medications included nebulized flunisolide, metoprolol, furosemide, and amphotericin B. The peak temperature on most days ranged from 38.4 to 39.4°C. Multiple physical examinations revealed coarse breath sounds and bilateral crackles and rhonchi. A CT scan of the thorax (Fig. 2), obtained without the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed nodular air-space opacities up to 3 cm in diameter, with air bronchograms in some of them; a small focus of air in an opacity in the right upper lobe, suggesting early cavitation; and diffuse ground-glass opacities. A sputum culture yielded a strain of S. aureus that was sensitive to vancomycin, rare colonies of Aspergillus fumigatus, and normal respiratory tract flora. Immune globulin (30 mg) was infused intravenously on the third hospital day.\\nOn the fourth day, laboratory tests were performed (Table 3). Progressive hypercapnia and hypoxemia required tracheal intubation and ventilatory assistance. A chest radiograph showed dense air-space opacities overlying the right hilar area and in the right lower lung, less dense nodular opacities in the left lung, and diffuse ground-glass opacities suggesting edema of the left lung.\\nOn the next day, laboratory tests were performed (Tables 2 and 4). Bronchoscopic examination showed pus in the right upper lobe and edema of the bronchus in the right middle lobe. Cultures of bronchoalveolar washings yielded a few colonies of S. aureus and a very small number of A. fumigatus organisms. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained without the intravenous injection of contrast material, revealed punctate splenic calcifications, a finding consistent with the presence of granulomas.\\nOn the sixth hospital day, a chest radiograph was unchanged, and an intradermal skin test with histamine was nonreactive. On the eighth day, serum protein electrophoresis showed six very-low-concentration bands; three were identified as IgG kappa and three as IgG lambda M components. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 2 and 4). A thoracic CT scan (Fig. 3), obtained without the administration of contrast material, showed more numerous lucent areas in the right upper lobe, which were consistent with the presence of cavitation. On the next day, a cardiac ultrasonographic examination revealed right ventricular pressure overload, dilatation, hypertrophy, and hypokinesis.\\nOn the 12th hospital day, laboratory tests were performed (Tables 2 and 3). Blood gases were analyzed (Table 1).\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. CAROLYN L. ROCHESTER*: May we review the radiographic studies?\\nDR. SUZANNE L.H. AQUINO: The chest radiograph obtained on admission to this hospital (Fig. 1) shows air-space opacities in both lungs. The CT scan obtained on admission (Fig. 2) shows diffuse ground-glass opacities, which are consistent with the presence of edema; patchy air-space opacities throughout the lungs, some of which have air bronchograms; and a focal lucent area in an opacity in the right upper lobe that suggests cavitation. The CT scan obtained five days later (Fig. 3) shows multifocal lucent areas that are consistent with the presence of cavitation in the opacity in the right upper lobe.\\nDR. ROCHESTER: This patient is immunocompromised as a result of both hypogammaglobulinemia and corticosteroid therapy. The hypogammaglobulinemia may be due to common variable immunodeficiency, an idiopathic acquired disorder characterized by heterogeneous defects in B-lymphocyte maturation and immune function.1,2 Levels of circulating B cells are generally normal, but the production of all major classes of immunoglobulins is deficient, and total serum IgG levels are reduced. However, the normal IgA levels in this patient and the absence of diffuse bronchiectasis are evidence against the diagnosis.3\\nDR. DAVID M. SYSTROM: Also, Dr. Rochester, the patient was relatively leukopenic in the course of her illness, and flow-cytometric analysis of peripheral blood revealed no B cells.\\nDR. ROCHESTER: The absence of B cells is strong evidence against the diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency, since the number of circulating B cells is usually normal in this disorder. The patient had received low-dose corticosteroids, had corticosteroid-induced myopathy, and received moderate-to-high doses of corticosteroids during her hospitalization at the other hospital and at this hospital.\\nThe differential diagnosis of this patient's air-space consolidation with ground-glass and nodular infiltrates, air bronchograms, and cavitation comprises three main categories of disease: neoplastic, inflammatory, and infectious.\\nPrimary and metastatic malignant tumors that can involve the lung, with the radiographic pattern described in this case, include bronchoalveolar-cell carcinoma, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, lymphoma, and plasmacytoma, but the clinical and laboratory findings associated with these tumors differ from those in this case.\\nThe inflammatory conditions that can cause the nonresolving pulmonary infiltrates seen in this patient include thromboembolic disease with pulmonary infarction, amyloidosis, granulomatous and vasculitic disorders (such as the Churg-Strauss syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, and sarcoidosis), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, and collagen vascular disease. In this case, two noninvasive studies of the legs showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis, and the clinical course is not strongly suggestive of acute or recurrent pulmonary embolism. Amyloid nodules may be multiple, contain air bronchograms, and cavitate or calcify, 4,5 but they enlarge slowly, are generally sharply demarcated, and are usually associated with mild respiratory symptoms, without fever.4\\nAllergic granulomatosis and angiitis, or the Churg-Strauss syndrome, may cause pulmonary infiltrates and severe bronchoconstriction. Adult-onset asthma is a central feature of the syndrome6,7 and of this patient's illness. Pulmonary nodules, which have been reported in patients with the Churg-Strauss syndrome, do not typically cavitate. Severe eosinophilia, a hallmark of the disease, was absent in this case, despite the eventual cessation of treatment with systemic corticosteroids. The IgE level, which is often elevated in patients with the Churg-Strauss syndrome, was normal in this patient, but an elevation could have been masked by her immunodeficiency. Extrapulmonary involvement of more than one organ is typical of the vasculitic phase of the syndrome, but none of the findings in this case are suggestive of systemic vasculitis, except for abnormalities on urinalysis. Finally, in patients with the Churg-Strauss syndrome, pulmonary infiltrates are unlikely to progress during treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, whereas the infiltrates in this patient did progress during such treatment.\\nMost patients with Wegener's granulomatosis present with pulmonary disease. Involvement of the kidneys and other organs is common, although forms limited to the respiratory system have been described.8 In this case, the history of sinus disease, multiple nodular pulmonary infiltrates with cavitation, small effusions, fever, anemia, microscopic hematuria, a drop in the hematocrit suggestive of alveolar hemorrhage, and worsening results of liver-function tests are all consistent with the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. This diagnosis is unlikely, however, because Wegener's granulomatosis has not been associated with asthma or pulmonary hypertension. Also, if the microscopic hematuria were due to glomerulonephritis, it would point to systemic rather than limited Wegener's granulomatosis, yet there is no evidence of hypertension or worsening renal function or of the involvement of other organs that are typically affected by the disease. Finally, the positive tests for antinuclear antibodies and the negative test for rheumatoid factor are not characteristic of Wegener's granulomatosis.\\nSarcoidosis involves the respiratory system, with variable clinical and radiographic findings in most patients at some point during the illness.10 Nodular infiltrates and dense air-space consolidation are occasionally present, and there may be areas of ground-glass infiltrates. However, sarcoidosis is an unlikely diagnosis in this case for many reasons; the most important reasons are the relatively rapid progression of the disease in this patient and its lack of response to corticosteroid treatment.\\nBronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia may occur in association with a wide variety of diseases, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and other inflammatory states, or it may be idiopathic.11,12 Fever, dyspnea, cough, and pulmonary infiltrates that do not respond to antibiotic therapy are typical findings. The radiographic findings may include dense air-space opacities, which may be nodular, and ground-glass infiltrates, as in this case. Cavitation of infiltrates13 and pleural effusions have been reported but are rare.12 Mild leukocytosis and positive but low titers of antinuclear antibodies have been reported. Unlike the pulmonary infiltrates in this case, however, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia is usually highly responsive to corticosteroid therapy, with an excellent prognosis.14 Although a variant of this disorder characterized by rapidly progressive hypoxemia and respiratory failure has been described, it too is often responsive to corticosteroids,15 and it is usually not associated with nodular or cavitary disease. Moreover, abnormalities of liver and renal function and pulmonary hypertension are not common unless there is a coexisting disease.\\nA collagen disease is a consideration in this case. Although no information on autoantibody subtypes is given in the case record, a positive test for antinuclear antibodies at a titer of 1:640 with a speckled pattern generally indicates the presence of antibodies against several antigens and suggests the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, scleroderma, or mixed connective-tissue disease.16 This patient has no history of cutaneous, musculoskeletal, or gastrointestinal disorders associated with these diagnoses, but the findings of antinuclear antibodies, microscopic hematuria, anemia, pulmonary hypertension (which may also be related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and fever, as well as her sex, are all consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. More than half the patients with this disease have pulmonary involvement,17 in the form of pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, pleuritis, acute pneumonitis with hypoxemia, alveolar hemorrhage, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, upper-airway obstruction or bronchiolitis obliterans, or respiratory-muscle dysfunction. Several features of this case, however, argue strongly against systemic lupus erythematosus as the sole explanation of the respiratory disease. There are no nervous system, skin, or musculoskeletal findings, the complement level is not low, and one might expect progressive renal failure if active systemic lupus erythematosus were progressing in the lungs despite treatment with moderate-to-high doses of corticosteroids. It is possible, however, that the patient had a pulmonary infection due to systemic lupus erythematosus or another autoimmune disease. 18 Indeed, infectious pneumonia is the most common cause of pulmonary infiltrates in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus,17 with a reported frequency of 31 to 76 percent.19 Multiple pathogens, including bacterial and opportunistic agents such as fungus and nocardia, have been implicated.\\nInfection is the most likely cause of the fever and unresolving pulmonary infiltrates in this patient. Several pathogens must be considered. Bacterial infection with a common pathogen such as staphylococcus or legionella is unlikely, since such infections are usually responsive to multiple courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially in combination with immune globulin-replacement therapy. Emboli from infective endocarditis are unlikely because of the absence of valvular vegetations on two echocardiographic studies. Parasitic infestation is improbable because of the absence of eosinophilia even after treatment with corticosteroids was discontinued and because there was no mention in the case history of travel to areas where parasitic disease is endemic. Reactivation tuberculosis and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia must be considered, but bronchial washings on two occasions did not contain the causative agents. Mycobacterium tuberculosis would probably have been isolated from the bronchial washings if it had been the pathogen, in view of the purulent secretions and cavitation of the infiltrate in the right upper lobe. P. carinii is less likely than other pathogens in a patient whose immune system is not compromised by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus.\\nBlastomycosis, cryptococcosis, and histoplasmosis are unlikely in the absence of travel to areas where these infections are endemic. Candida, isolated twice from this patient's respiratory tract, is a potential cause of nosocomial infection in patients receiving prolonged treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics,20 and infection with the organism may cause diffuse or localized pulmonary infiltrates. However, colonization of the respiratory tract with candida is much more common than candida pneumonia, and there was no candidemia or evidence of infection of other organs in this patient. Mucormycosis would be an even more improbable cause of the pulmonary infiltrates.20\\nInfection with Rhodococcus equi or nocardia or invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is more likely in this patient, with her history of immunosuppression and possibly concomitant autoimmune disease. Each infection can cause fever, nodular air-space consolidation, purulent secretions, and progressive hypoxemia despite prolonged antibiotic therapy. Each may be difficult to diagnose without careful examination of respiratory secretions or a tissue-biopsy specimen. R. equi, an aerobic, nonmotile, gram-positive organism that does not form spores, may cause pulmonary infection in immunocompromised hosts21,22 after inhalation. It may be isolated from sputum, and its presence in respiratory tract secretions heralds the disease. An explicit request to look for this pathogen must be made to the laboratory, however, because colonies in sputum specimens may otherwise be misinterpreted as normal flora. The radiographic findings in the chest may progress from localized infiltrates to multiple areas of dense consolidation, with cavitation in about half the cases. Although many antibiotics have in vitro activity against rhodococcus, the infection is often not eradicated by antibiotic treatment. Nocardia species, especially Nocardia asteroides, cause pulmonary infection in immunosuppressed hosts. 23,24 Radiographic studies often show segmental or lobar nodular infiltrates with cavitation. Although the detection of nocardia species in respiratory secretions usually indicates the presence of the disease, pneumonia due to this organism may be difficult to diagnose, since sputum smears may be negative, and it may take days or even weeks to isolate the organism in culture. Although clindamycin, which this patient received, has some activity against nocardia, prolonged treatment with sulfonamides, which the patient did not receive, is usually necessary to control the disease.\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis can cause pulmonary infiltrates in association with asthma. 25 Aspergillus was isolated from the patient's sputum and bronchial washings, but there was no evidence of diffuse central bronchiectasis, which is characteristic of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Also, the infiltrates in this disease usually do not have a nodular or ground-glass appearance and do not contain air bronchograms. The peripheral-blood IgE level and eosinophil count were not elevated in this patient, even when the disease progressed and systemic corticosteroids were discontinued (although these findings may have been altered or masked by the hypogammaglobulinemia and recent corticosteroid treatment), mucoid plugs containing aspergillus were not present on bronchoscopic evaluation, and the patient's condition deteriorated despite high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Moreover, this diagnosis does not explain the positive test for antinuclear antibodies and the abnormalities on urinalysis.\\nI cannot rule out bronchocentric granulomatosis, which is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation in the bronchial and bronchiolar mucosa and which can be associated with asthma. Aspergillus may colonize the lesions of bronchocentric granulomatosis, and malaise, fever, and radiographic evidence of focal consolidation are common.26 All these findings are present in this case.\\nInvasive aspergillosis is the most likely cause of this patient's pulmonary disease. Hypogammaglobulinemia and prolonged corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy confer a predisposition to such infection. Cases of invasive aspergillosis have been reported in persons with corticosteroid-dependent asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.27 This patient may also have been predisposed to invasive infection with aspergillus if the organism had previously colonized her sinuses or lower airways, which may have been structurally abnormal, with impaired clearance of mucus due to recurrent bacterial infections. The temporal course of her illness, the radiographic findings, and the isolation of aspergillus from sputum and bronchial washings 28,29 are consistent with this diagnosis.\\nAspergillus may proliferate in the airways and then invade the lung parenchyma and pulmonary arterioles. Progression to dense consolidation and cavitation may occur when the corticosteroid dose is diminished, as in this case, resulting in an increased inflammatory response to the organism. Invasive aspergillosis can cause localized alveolar hemorrhage, which is evident in this case, due to angioinvasion and secondary regional pulmonary infarction. In one study, 50 percent of immunocompromised patients with severe pulmonary hemorrhage had invasive aspergillus infection.30 This patient received fluconazole for several days and subsequently received empirical therapy with amphotericin B, but the disease may progress despite therapy, and mortality from this disease is high.31 The elevated liver-enzyme levels in the later stages of this patient's illness may have been caused by passive congestion, with worsening rightsided heart failure and worsening pulmonary hypertension due to vascular invasion with aspergillus superimposed on the underlying disease, or the liver abnormalities could reflect fungal invasion of the liver.\\nThe diagnostic procedure was probably an open or thoracoscopically performed lung biopsy.\\nDR. SYSTROM: Our diagnosis was fungal disease. Because of the finding of aspergillus in the bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid, we considered invasive aspergillosis but favored the diagnosis of bronchocentric granulomatosis.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\nBronchocentric granulomatosis.\\n? Invasive aspergillosis.\\nDR. CAROLYN L. ROCHESTER'S DIAGNOSES\\nInvasive aspergillosis of the lungs.\\n? Bronchocentric granulomatosis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. RICHARD L. KRADIN: The diagnostic procedure was a thoracotomy with wedge biopsies of the upper and lower lobes of the right lung; the largest biopsy specimen was 5 by 4 by 3 cm. The predominant microscopical finding was a diffuse polymorphous infiltrate of inflammatory cells that surrounded the bronchi and expanded the alveolar septa (Fig. 4). Necrotizing granulomatous inflammation involved terminal bronchioles and their lumens focally in the lower lobe (Fig. 5), with some lumens plugged by entangled masses of aspergillus hyphae (Fig. 6), which did not transgress the airway wall or invade the parenchyma. A mononuclear cell near an involved bronchiole contained nuclear and intracytoplasmic basophilic inclusions characteristic of cytomegalovirus (Fig. 7). An emphysematous bulla adjacent to the involved bronchioles contained blood, fibrin, and fungi within its lumen but without parenchymal invasion.\\nThese findings reflect part of a spectrum of pathological responses to aspergillus species. There are several forms of aspergillus lung disease in addition to invasive aspergillosis.32 Saprophytic disorders reflect colonization of structurally abnormal airways. Defective mucociliary clearance in patients with chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis may promote colonization of the airways by aspergillus species. A cavitary lung disorder caused by emphysema, tuberculosis, cystic sarcoidosis, abscesses, developmental cysts, or cavitating carcinomas may be a site of saprophytic overgrowth by aspergillus, with the formation of aspergillomas. 33 Fungal colonization of bronchiectatic airways can give rise to aspergillomas, presumably from extension into preexisting cavitary spaces. 34 Fungal invasion of a preexisting emphysematous cavity may also occur without the formation of an aspergilloma. In this case, a discrete aspergilloma was not identified. Aspergilli may colonize a pulmonary infarct, resulting in a lesion that is difficult to distinguish pathologically from primary fungal invasion.35 The pathological features of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis have been discussed by Dr. Rochester.\\nBronchocentric granulomatosis develops in some patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. This disorder is distinguished from other types of granulomatosis and angiitis by its propensity to target small airways, largely sparing the adjacent pulmonary vasculature. In approximately half the reported cases, the patients had asthma, and in most of the cases, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis was present.36 In bronchocentric granulomatosis, the bronchiolar wall is destroyed by granulomatous inflammation, and neutrophils, cellular debris, and mucin may accumulate in the lumens. Fungal hyphae may be identified within the lumen, as in the case under discussion. Eosinophils are often a prominent component of the peribronchiolar infiltrate in patients with asthma, but corticosteroid therapy can eliminate this finding. Bronchocentric granulomatosis may complicate other infections, including tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, 37 mucormycosis, and invasive aspergillosis. 38\\nThe cause of the prominent, diffuse lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis in this case is uncertain. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is characterized by lymphohistiocytic infiltrates, bronchiolitis, and granulomatous inflammation. The disorder has been reported in malt workers exposed to A. clavatus,39 generally in the absence of asthma and tissue eosinophilia; unusual cases of hypersensitivity to A. fumigatus have also been reported.40 Another possible cause of the diffuse interstitial infiltrates in this patient is cytomegalovirus pneumonitis, but only one infected cell was identified, despite immunostaining for cytomegalovirus antigen. Therefore, the presence of cytomegalovirus probably reflects the patient's immunosuppression.\\nWe did not find evidence of invasive aspergillosis in these biopsy specimens, but the radiographic and clinical features of the case suggest the possibility of invasive disease elsewhere in the lungs.\\nDR. SYSTROM: The patient had increasing hypoxemia with progressive air-space disease, eventually requiring endotracheal intubation with enhanced ventilation. We were faced with a very difficult treatment decision after the lung biopsy. Since she was profoundly immunosuppressed, invasive aspergillosis was likely, and we administered liposomal amphotericin B, without any major improvement. On the other hand, we were concerned that the progressive disease was related in part to a hypersensitivity component. At one point, when corticosteroids were reduced to a low level, we were convinced that the air-space disease had worsened, and we had to increase the dose of corticosteroids. Eventually, refractory methicillin-resistant S. aureus pneumonia, sepsis, and progressive multiorgan dysfunction, including renal failure, developed, and the patient died from vancomycin-resistant enterococcal septicemia. Permission for an autopsy was refused.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Was the patient treated for cytomegalovirus infection?\\nDR. CAMILLE N. KOTTON: She received foscarnet because there was a national shortage of ganciclovir at the time.\\nDR. ROCHESTER: I believe that the fact that the cavitation was initially restricted to one area and was subsequently present in multiple areas in the right upper lobe indicates the presence of invasive aspergillosis, although it was not seen in the biopsy specimens. Unfortunately, we lack laboratory data to establish the cause of the hypogammaglobulinemia. The precise nature of the underlying immunodeficiency remains unclear.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "{'query': \"A 47-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of bronchopulmonary disease.\\nSix years before admission, pneumonia had developed, and asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had been diagnosed. Thereafter, the patient had pneumonia and sinusitis at least twice a year. Three years before admission, hypogammaglobulinemia was detected. Immune globulin was administered intravenously every 6 weeks, resulting in fewer bouts of pneumonia, until 14 months before admission, when the infusions were no longer approved by her insurer. The patient was able to climb stairs and to take 45-minute walks while taking prednisone (5 mg daily).\\nThirty-seven days before admission, the patient entered another hospital with an exacerbation of bronchoconstriction. On physical examination, she was afebrile; rhonchi and wheezes were heard. The white-cell count was 12,500 per cubic millimeter. Blood gases were evaluated (Table 1). Treatment with methylprednisolone (30 mg every eight hours), ceftizoxime, and trovafloxacin was ineffective. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses showed an air-fluid level in the right maxillary antrum. Ciprofloxacin and clindamycin were substituted for the other medications. A sputum culture yielded yeasts and pseudomonas. Aztreonam and fluconazole were administered, and clindamycin was discontinued. Atrial fibrillation developed. Two noninvasive studies showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis of the legs. A myocardial infarct was ruled out. A cardiac ultrasonographic study revealed normal left ventricular function, right ventricular dilatation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation; the calculated pulmonary-artery systolic pressure was 53 to 60 mm Hg. The rhythm reverted to normal spontaneously, but atrial fibrillation recurred intermittently thereafter.\\nOn the 18th hospital day, fluconazole was discontinued. On the 27th day, blood gases were analyzed (Table 1). A thoracic CT scan showed consolidation in the right middle lobe. Two days later, bronchoscopic examination revealed scanty purulent tan secretions, slight reddening of both main bronchi, erythema and edema of more distal airways, and streaks of blood in the lingular airways. Culture of bronchoalveolar washings yielded methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and candida; cytologic examination showed no abnormalities. Vancomycin was administered. Four days later, the patient's temperature rose to 38.3°C, and a radiograph revealed a new density in the right upper lobe. On the 37th day, blood gases were analyzed (Table 1). Her medications at that time included ceftazidime, vancomycin, furosemide, digoxin, enalapril, diltiazem, beclomethasone nasal spray, nebulized albuterol, nebulized ipratropium, and dornase alfa. She was transferred to this hospital.\\nThe patient had a history of hypertension with cardiomegaly and corticosteroid myopathy, as well as a 45-pack-year history of cigarette smoking, which she had discontinued six years before admission. Her father had died of emphysema, and her mother of hypertension. Several of her children had asthma.\\nThe temperature was 38.4°C, the pulse was 93, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was markedly obese, with moon facies and abdominal striae. Bilateral pulmonary crackles were heard. The heart sounds were normal. There was peripheral edema (+++).\\nThe urine was positive (+) for protein; the sediment contained 20 to 50 red cells and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 2, 3, and 4), and blood gases were analyzed (Table 1). A radiograph of the chest (Fig. 1) showed air-space opacities at the bases of both lungs.\\nSpecimens of blood, sputum, and stool were obtained for culture. Minidose heparin, digoxin, ceftazidime, levofloxacin, fluconazole, vancomycin, enalapril, albuterol, ipratropium, furosemide, and ranitidine were administered. Subsequent medications included nebulized flunisolide, metoprolol, furosemide, and amphotericin B. The peak temperature on most days ranged from 38.4 to 39.4°C. Multiple physical examinations revealed coarse breath sounds and bilateral crackles and rhonchi. A CT scan of the thorax (Fig. 2), obtained without the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed nodular air-space opacities up to 3 cm in diameter, with air bronchograms in some of them; a small focus of air in an opacity in the right upper lobe, suggesting early cavitation; and diffuse ground-glass opacities. A sputum culture yielded a strain of S. aureus that was sensitive to vancomycin, rare colonies of Aspergillus fumigatus, and normal respiratory tract flora. Immune globulin (30 mg) was infused intravenously on the third hospital day.\\nOn the fourth day, laboratory tests were performed (Table 3). Progressive hypercapnia and hypoxemia required tracheal intubation and ventilatory assistance. A chest radiograph showed dense air-space opacities overlying the right hilar area and in the right lower lung, less dense nodular opacities in the left lung, and diffuse ground-glass opacities suggesting edema of the left lung.\\nOn the next day, laboratory tests were performed (Tables 2 and 4). Bronchoscopic examination showed pus in the right upper lobe and edema of the bronchus in the right middle lobe. Cultures of bronchoalveolar washings yielded a few colonies of S. aureus and a very small number of A. fumigatus organisms. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained without the intravenous injection of contrast material, revealed punctate splenic calcifications, a finding consistent with the presence of granulomas.\\nOn the sixth hospital day, a chest radiograph was unchanged, and an intradermal skin test with histamine was nonreactive. On the eighth day, serum protein electrophoresis showed six very-low-concentration bands; three were identified as IgG kappa and three as IgG lambda M components. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 2 and 4). A thoracic CT scan (Fig. 3), obtained without the administration of contrast material, showed more numerous lucent areas in the right upper lobe, which were consistent with the presence of cavitation. On the next day, a cardiac ultrasonographic examination revealed right ventricular pressure overload, dilatation, hypertrophy, and hypokinesis.\\nOn the 12th hospital day, laboratory tests were performed (Tables 2 and 3). Blood gases were analyzed (Table 1).\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. CAROLYN L. ROCHESTER*: May we review the radiographic studies?\\nDR. SUZANNE L.H. AQUINO: The chest radiograph obtained on admission to this hospital (Fig. 1) shows air-space opacities in both lungs. The CT scan obtained on admission (Fig. 2) shows diffuse ground-glass opacities, which are consistent with the presence of edema; patchy air-space opacities throughout the lungs, some of which have air bronchograms; and a focal lucent area in an opacity in the right upper lobe that suggests cavitation. The CT scan obtained five days later (Fig. 3) shows multifocal lucent areas that are consistent with the presence of cavitation in the opacity in the right upper lobe.\\nDR. ROCHESTER: This patient is immunocompromised as a result of both hypogammaglobulinemia and corticosteroid therapy. The hypogammaglobulinemia may be due to common variable immunodeficiency, an idiopathic acquired disorder characterized by heterogeneous defects in B-lymphocyte maturation and immune function.1,2 Levels of circulating B cells are generally normal, but the production of all major classes of immunoglobulins is deficient, and total serum IgG levels are reduced. However, the normal IgA levels in this patient and the absence of diffuse bronchiectasis are evidence against the diagnosis.3\\nDR. DAVID M. SYSTROM: Also, Dr. Rochester, the patient was relatively leukopenic in the course of her illness, and flow-cytometric analysis of peripheral blood revealed no B cells.\\nDR. ROCHESTER: The absence of B cells is strong evidence against the diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency, since the number of circulating B cells is usually normal in this disorder. The patient had received low-dose corticosteroids, had corticosteroid-induced myopathy, and received moderate-to-high doses of corticosteroids during her hospitalization at the other hospital and at this hospital.\\nThe differential diagnosis of this patient's air-space consolidation with ground-glass and nodular infiltrates, air bronchograms, and cavitation comprises three main categories of disease: neoplastic, inflammatory, and infectious.\\nPrimary and metastatic malignant tumors that can involve the lung, with the radiographic pattern described in this case, include bronchoalveolar-cell carcinoma, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, lymphoma, and plasmacytoma, but the clinical and laboratory findings associated with these tumors differ from those in this case.\\nThe inflammatory conditions that can cause the nonresolving pulmonary infiltrates seen in this patient include thromboembolic disease with pulmonary infarction, amyloidosis, granulomatous and vasculitic disorders (such as the Churg-Strauss syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, and sarcoidosis), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, and collagen vascular disease. In this case, two noninvasive studies of the legs showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis, and the clinical course is not strongly suggestive of acute or recurrent pulmonary embolism. Amyloid nodules may be multiple, contain air bronchograms, and cavitate or calcify, 4,5 but they enlarge slowly, are generally sharply demarcated, and are usually associated with mild respiratory symptoms, without fever.4\\nAllergic granulomatosis and angiitis, or the Churg-Strauss syndrome, may cause pulmonary infiltrates and severe bronchoconstriction. Adult-onset asthma is a central feature of the syndrome6,7 and of this patient's illness. Pulmonary nodules, which have been reported in patients with the Churg-Strauss syndrome, do not typically cavitate. Severe eosinophilia, a hallmark of the disease, was absent in this case, despite the eventual cessation of treatment with systemic corticosteroids. The IgE level, which is often elevated in patients with the Churg-Strauss syndrome, was normal in this patient, but an elevation could have been masked by her immunodeficiency. Extrapulmonary involvement of more than one organ is typical of the vasculitic phase of the syndrome, but none of the findings in this case are suggestive of systemic vasculitis, except for abnormalities on urinalysis. Finally, in patients with the Churg-Strauss syndrome, pulmonary infiltrates are unlikely to progress during treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, whereas the infiltrates in this patient did progress during such treatment.\\nMost patients with Wegener's granulomatosis present with pulmonary disease. Involvement of the kidneys and other organs is common, although forms limited to the respiratory system have been described.8 In this case, the history of sinus disease, multiple nodular pulmonary infiltrates with cavitation, small effusions, fever, anemia, microscopic hematuria, a drop in the hematocrit suggestive of alveolar hemorrhage, and worsening results of liver-function tests are all consistent with the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. This diagnosis is unlikely, however, because Wegener's granulomatosis has not been associated with asthma or pulmonary hypertension. Also, if the microscopic hematuria were due to glomerulonephritis, it would point to systemic rather than limited Wegener's granulomatosis, yet there is no evidence of hypertension or worsening renal function or of the involvement of other organs that are typically affected by the disease. Finally, the positive tests for antinuclear antibodies and the negative test for rheumatoid factor are not characteristic of Wegener's granulomatosis.\\nSarcoidosis involves the respiratory system, with variable clinical and radiographic findings in most patients at some point during the illness.10 Nodular infiltrates and dense air-space consolidation are occasionally present, and there may be areas of ground-glass infiltrates. However, sarcoidosis is an unlikely diagnosis in this case for many reasons; the most important reasons are the relatively rapid progression of the disease in this patient and its lack of response to corticosteroid treatment.\\nBronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia may occur in association with a wide variety of diseases, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and other inflammatory states, or it may be idiopathic.11,12 Fever, dyspnea, cough, and pulmonary infiltrates that do not respond to antibiotic therapy are typical findings. The radiographic findings may include dense air-space opacities, which may be nodular, and ground-glass infiltrates, as in this case. Cavitation of infiltrates13 and pleural effusions have been reported but are rare.12 Mild leukocytosis and positive but low titers of antinuclear antibodies have been reported. Unlike the pulmonary infiltrates in this case, however, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia is usually highly responsive to corticosteroid therapy, with an excellent prognosis.14 Although a variant of this disorder characterized by rapidly progressive hypoxemia and respiratory failure has been described, it too is often responsive to corticosteroids,15 and it is usually not associated with nodular or cavitary disease. Moreover, abnormalities of liver and renal function and pulmonary hypertension are not common unless there is a coexisting disease.\\nA collagen disease is a consideration in this case. Although no information on autoantibody subtypes is given in the case record, a positive test for antinuclear antibodies at a titer of 1:640 with a speckled pattern generally indicates the presence of antibodies against several antigens and suggests the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, scleroderma, or mixed connective-tissue disease.16 This patient has no history of cutaneous, musculoskeletal, or gastrointestinal disorders associated with these diagnoses, but the findings of antinuclear antibodies, microscopic hematuria, anemia, pulmonary hypertension (which may also be related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and fever, as well as her sex, are all consistent with the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. More than half the patients with this disease have pulmonary involvement,17 in the form of pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, pleuritis, acute pneumonitis with hypoxemia, alveolar hemorrhage, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, upper-airway obstruction or bronchiolitis obliterans, or respiratory-muscle dysfunction. Several features of this case, however, argue strongly against systemic lupus erythematosus as the sole explanation of the respiratory disease. There are no nervous system, skin, or musculoskeletal findings, the complement level is not low, and one might expect progressive renal failure if active systemic lupus erythematosus were progressing in the lungs despite treatment with moderate-to-high doses of corticosteroids. It is possible, however, that the patient had a pulmonary infection due to systemic lupus erythematosus or another autoimmune disease. 18 Indeed, infectious pneumonia is the most common cause of pulmonary infiltrates in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus,17 with a reported frequency of 31 to 76 percent.19 Multiple pathogens, including bacterial and opportunistic agents such as fungus and nocardia, have been implicated.\\nInfection is the most likely cause of the fever and unresolving pulmonary infiltrates in this patient. Several pathogens must be considered. Bacterial infection with a common pathogen such as staphylococcus or legionella is unlikely, since such infections are usually responsive to multiple courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially in combination with immune globulin-replacement therapy. Emboli from infective endocarditis are unlikely because of the absence of valvular vegetations on two echocardiographic studies. Parasitic infestation is improbable because of the absence of eosinophilia even after treatment with corticosteroids was discontinued and because there was no mention in the case history of travel to areas where parasitic disease is endemic. Reactivation tuberculosis and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia must be considered, but bronchial washings on two occasions did not contain the causative agents. Mycobacterium tuberculosis would probably have been isolated from the bronchial washings if it had been the pathogen, in view of the purulent secretions and cavitation of the infiltrate in the right upper lobe. P. carinii is less likely than other pathogens in a patient whose immune system is not compromised by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus.\\nBlastomycosis, cryptococcosis, and histoplasmosis are unlikely in the absence of travel to areas where these infections are endemic. Candida, isolated twice from this patient's respiratory tract, is a potential cause of nosocomial infection in patients receiving prolonged treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics,20 and infection with the organism may cause diffuse or localized pulmonary infiltrates. However, colonization of the respiratory tract with candida is much more common than candida pneumonia, and there was no candidemia or evidence of infection of other organs in this patient. Mucormycosis would be an even more improbable cause of the pulmonary infiltrates.20\\nInfection with Rhodococcus equi or nocardia or invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is more likely in this patient, with her history of immunosuppression and possibly concomitant autoimmune disease. Each infection can cause fever, nodular air-space consolidation, purulent secretions, and progressive hypoxemia despite prolonged antibiotic therapy. Each may be difficult to diagnose without careful examination of respiratory secretions or a tissue-biopsy specimen. R. equi, an aerobic, nonmotile, gram-positive organism that does not form spores, may cause pulmonary infection in immunocompromised hosts21,22 after inhalation. It may be isolated from sputum, and its presence in respiratory tract secretions heralds the disease. An explicit request to look for this pathogen must be made to the laboratory, however, because colonies in sputum specimens may otherwise be misinterpreted as normal flora. The radiographic findings in the chest may progress from localized infiltrates to multiple areas of dense consolidation, with cavitation in about half the cases. Although many antibiotics have in vitro activity against rhodococcus, the infection is often not eradicated by antibiotic treatment. Nocardia species, especially Nocardia asteroides, cause pulmonary infection in immunosuppressed hosts. 23,24 Radiographic studies often show segmental or lobar nodular infiltrates with cavitation. Although the detection of nocardia species in respiratory secretions usually indicates the presence of the disease, pneumonia due to this organism may be difficult to diagnose, since sputum smears may be negative, and it may take days or even weeks to isolate the organism in culture. Although clindamycin, which this patient received, has some activity against nocardia, prolonged treatment with sulfonamides, which the patient did not receive, is usually necessary to control the disease.\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis can cause pulmonary infiltrates in association with asthma. 25 Aspergillus was isolated from the patient's sputum and bronchial washings, but there was no evidence of diffuse central bronchiectasis, which is characteristic of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Also, the infiltrates in this disease usually do not have a nodular or ground-glass appearance and do not contain air bronchograms. The peripheral-blood IgE level and eosinophil count were not elevated in this patient, even when the disease progressed and systemic corticosteroids were discontinued (although these findings may have been altered or masked by the hypogammaglobulinemia and recent corticosteroid treatment), mucoid plugs containing aspergillus were not present on bronchoscopic evaluation, and the patient's condition deteriorated despite high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Moreover, this diagnosis does not explain the positive test for antinuclear antibodies and the abnormalities on urinalysis.\\nI cannot rule out bronchocentric granulomatosis, which is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation in the bronchial and bronchiolar mucosa and which can be associated with asthma. Aspergillus may colonize the lesions of bronchocentric granulomatosis, and malaise, fever, and radiographic evidence of focal consolidation are common.26 All these findings are present in this case.\\nInvasive aspergillosis is the most likely cause of this patient's pulmonary disease. Hypogammaglobulinemia and prolonged corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy confer a predisposition to such infection. Cases of invasive aspergillosis have been reported in persons with corticosteroid-dependent asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.27 This patient may also have been predisposed to invasive infection with aspergillus if the organism had previously colonized her sinuses or lower airways, which may have been structurally abnormal, with impaired clearance of mucus due to recurrent bacterial infections. The temporal course of her illness, the radiographic findings, and the isolation of aspergillus from sputum and bronchial washings 28,29 are consistent with this diagnosis.\\nAspergillus may proliferate in the airways and then invade the lung parenchyma and pulmonary arterioles. Progression to dense consolidation and cavitation may occur when the corticosteroid dose is diminished, as in this case, resulting in an increased inflammatory response to the organism. Invasive aspergillosis can cause localized alveolar hemorrhage, which is evident in this case, due to angioinvasion and secondary regional pulmonary infarction. In one study, 50 percent of immunocompromised patients with severe pulmonary hemorrhage had invasive aspergillus infection.30 This patient received fluconazole for several days and subsequently received empirical therapy with amphotericin B, but the disease may progress despite therapy, and mortality from this disease is high.31 The elevated liver-enzyme levels in the later stages of this patient's illness may have been caused by passive congestion, with worsening rightsided heart failure and worsening pulmonary hypertension due to vascular invasion with aspergillus superimposed on the underlying disease, or the liver abnormalities could reflect fungal invasion of the liver.\\nThe diagnostic procedure was probably an open or thoracoscopically performed lung biopsy.\\nDR. SYSTROM: Our diagnosis was fungal disease. Because of the finding of aspergillus in the bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid, we considered invasive aspergillosis but favored the diagnosis of bronchocentric granulomatosis.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\nBronchocentric granulomatosis.\\n? Invasive aspergillosis.\\nDR. CAROLYN L. ROCHESTER'S DIAGNOSES\\nInvasive aspergillosis of the lungs.\\n? Bronchocentric granulomatosis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. RICHARD L. KRADIN: The diagnostic procedure was a thoracotomy with wedge biopsies of the upper and lower lobes of the right lung; the largest biopsy specimen was 5 by 4 by 3 cm. The predominant microscopical finding was a diffuse polymorphous infiltrate of inflammatory cells that surrounded the bronchi and expanded the alveolar septa (Fig. 4). Necrotizing granulomatous inflammation involved terminal bronchioles and their lumens focally in the lower lobe (Fig. 5), with some lumens plugged by entangled masses of aspergillus hyphae (Fig. 6), which did not transgress the airway wall or invade the parenchyma. A mononuclear cell near an involved bronchiole contained nuclear and intracytoplasmic basophilic inclusions characteristic of cytomegalovirus (Fig. 7). An emphysematous bulla adjacent to the involved bronchioles contained blood, fibrin, and fungi within its lumen but without parenchymal invasion.\\nThese findings reflect part of a spectrum of pathological responses to aspergillus species. There are several forms of aspergillus lung disease in addition to invasive aspergillosis.32 Saprophytic disorders reflect colonization of structurally abnormal airways. Defective mucociliary clearance in patients with chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis may promote colonization of the airways by aspergillus species. A cavitary lung disorder caused by emphysema, tuberculosis, cystic sarcoidosis, abscesses, developmental cysts, or cavitating carcinomas may be a site of saprophytic overgrowth by aspergillus, with the formation of aspergillomas. 33 Fungal colonization of bronchiectatic airways can give rise to aspergillomas, presumably from extension into preexisting cavitary spaces. 34 Fungal invasion of a preexisting emphysematous cavity may also occur without the formation of an aspergilloma. In this case, a discrete aspergilloma was not identified. Aspergilli may colonize a pulmonary infarct, resulting in a lesion that is difficult to distinguish pathologically from primary fungal invasion.35 The pathological features of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis have been discussed by Dr. Rochester.\\nBronchocentric granulomatosis develops in some patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. This disorder is distinguished from other types of granulomatosis and angiitis by its propensity to target small airways, largely sparing the adjacent pulmonary vasculature. In approximately half the reported cases, the patients had asthma, and in most of the cases, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis was present.36 In bronchocentric granulomatosis, the bronchiolar wall is destroyed by granulomatous inflammation, and neutrophils, cellular debris, and mucin may accumulate in the lumens. Fungal hyphae may be identified within the lumen, as in the case under discussion. Eosinophils are often a prominent component of the peribronchiolar infiltrate in patients with asthma, but corticosteroid therapy can eliminate this finding. Bronchocentric granulomatosis may complicate other infections, including tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, 37 mucormycosis, and invasive aspergillosis. 38\\nThe cause of the prominent, diffuse lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis in this case is uncertain. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is characterized by lymphohistiocytic infiltrates, bronchiolitis, and granulomatous inflammation. The disorder has been reported in malt workers exposed to A. clavatus,39 generally in the absence of asthma and tissue eosinophilia; unusual cases of hypersensitivity to A. fumigatus have also been reported.40 Another possible cause of the diffuse interstitial infiltrates in this patient is cytomegalovirus pneumonitis, but only one infected cell was identified, despite immunostaining for cytomegalovirus antigen. Therefore, the presence of cytomegalovirus probably reflects the patient's immunosuppression.\\nWe did not find evidence of invasive aspergillosis in these biopsy specimens, but the radiographic and clinical features of the case suggest the possibility of invasive disease elsewhere in the lungs.\\nDR. SYSTROM: The patient had increasing hypoxemia with progressive air-space disease, eventually requiring endotracheal intubation with enhanced ventilation. We were faced with a very difficult treatment decision after the lung biopsy. Since she was profoundly immunosuppressed, invasive aspergillosis was likely, and we administered liposomal amphotericin B, without any major improvement. On the other hand, we were concerned that the progressive disease was related in part to a hypersensitivity component. At one point, when corticosteroids were reduced to a low level, we were convinced that the air-space disease had worsened, and we had to increase the dose of corticosteroids. Eventually, refractory methicillin-resistant S. aureus pneumonia, sepsis, and progressive multiorgan dysfunction, including renal failure, developed, and the patient died from vancomycin-resistant enterococcal septicemia. Permission for an autopsy was refused.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: Was the patient treated for cytomegalovirus infection?\\nDR. CAMILLE N. KOTTON: She received foscarnet because there was a national shortage of ganciclovir at the time.\\nDR. ROCHESTER: I believe that the fact that the cavitation was initially restricted to one area and was subsequently present in multiple areas in the right upper lobe indicates the presence of invasive aspergillosis, although it was not seen in the biopsy specimens. Unfortunately, we lack laboratory data to establish the cause of the hypogammaglobulinemia.

Even\\nwhen the pattern of involvement is not classic, as was\\ntrue in this case, sarcoidosis is a possibility, since atyp-\\nical presentations are not uncommon.\\nBecause of the atypical, multiorgan presenta-\\ntion and the biochemical abnormalities in liver\\nfunction, a needle biopsy of the liver was per-\\nformed. The biopsy revealed that some of the por-\\ntal tracts were expanded by non-necrotizing gran-\\nulomas with multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 2).\\nSpecial stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungi were\\nnegative.

The combination of unintentional weight loss, positive PPD, facial droop, impaired eye movement, proptosis, and lymphadenopathy raises concern for a serious underlying condition. While TB is a possibility, the lack of typical respiratory symptoms makes it less likely. The elevated alkaline phosphatase and granulomas on liver biopsy suggest a possible hepatic involvement, which could be related to TB, sarcoidosis, or another granulomatous disease. The patient's age and history of TB exposure also increase the risk of reactivation.\\n\\nGiven the constellation of findings, the most likely diagnosis is **Sarcoidosis** with possible hepatic involvement.\\n\\nWORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Sarcoidosis with possible hepatic involvement, likely stage I or II.\\nDISEASE_NAME: Sarcoidosis\\n\", 'original_file': 'NEJM200104053441408.json'}\n",

He had no signs of meningeal irritation. He was intubated, placed on cardiopulmonary support, andgiven large doses of catecholamines. A single dose of dexamethasone (3 mg per kilogram of body weight) was givenimmediately, and treatment with penicillin G (16 million IU per square meter of body-surface area) was started. Mean-while, the petechiae spread rapidly, and four hours later peripheral pulses could not be detected in the arms or legs.Therapy with fresh-frozen plasma and heparin was also begun.

Three weeks earlier, she had undergone a cesarean section because of multiple bouts of fetal bradycardia; the infant was delivered at 40 weeks of gestation. The pregnancy was otherwise uneventful. She received a single dose of gentamicin and two doses of clindamycin intravenously in the peripartum period. Her postpartum course was uneventful, and she was discharged on the third postoperative day.\\nThree days before admission, the patient began to have pain in the right lower quadrant of her abdomen. The pain became more severe the next day and was accompanied by very frequent, watery stools that were brown and later black, nausea, and a temperature that peaked at 38.3°C. She passed no fresh blood. One day before admission, 2 liters of fluid with electrolytes was administered intravenously. On the day of admission, the pain became more severe and was unrelieved by acetaminophen–oxycodone, although the diarrhea had ceased.\\nThe patient did not have a history of previous abdominal pain or exposure to patients with gastroenteritis, and there was no family history of inflammatory bowel disease. She resided in eastern Massachusetts.\\nThe temperature was 38.7°C, the pulse was 104, and the respirations were 16. The blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was in considerable pain. Her abdomen was soft but exquisitely tender in the right lower quadrant, without rebound tenderness; bowel sounds were diminished. A stool specimen contained occult blood.\\nThe urine was normal; the sediment contained 0 to 2 red cells and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field. The results of hematologic studies performed at various times during the hospital stay are shown in Table 1. Blood chemical values were normal. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the rectal administration of contrast material (Fig. 1), revealed concentric thickening of the wall of the cecum and proximal ascending colon, with fat stranding and prominent lymph nodes in the adjacent mesentery. A transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonographic study of the pelvis showed no abnormalities.\\nMorphine was given intravenously. A blood specimen and a rectal swab were obtained for culture. Ampicillin, gentamicin, and fluid and electrolytes were administered intravenously; heparin was injected subcutaneously, and metronidazole was given orally. Total parenteral nutrition was instituted. The temperature rose to 39.1°C on the first hospital day. The uterus was not tender; its size corresponded to a 12-week gestation; there was no discharge.\\nOn the second hospital day, the temperature rose to 38.8°C. Blood chemical tests were performed on this day and subsequently during the hospital course (Table 2). An abdominal radiograph showed no abnormalities. The administration of analgesia, controlled by the patient, was begun. The pain improved briefly, but the patient refused abdominal examination because of extreme tenderness.\\nOn the third hospital day, the patient passed a voluminous brown, watery stool, with a subsequent increase in abdominal pain. The temperature was 38.2°C. The findings on physical examination were unchanged. Colonoscopic examination, which had to be discontinued at the splenic flexure because of the presence of stool, showed no abnormalities. A biopsy specimen was obtained. A stool sample was negative for Clostridium difficile toxin. An ultrasonographic study of the legs showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the intravenous and oral administration of contrast material, showed concentric thickening of the colon from the cecum to the hepatic flexure, with adjacent fat stranding. There was normal enhancement of the right ovarian vein; filling defects, a sign of thrombosis, were absent. Low-molecular-weight heparin was substituted for heparin. Later in the day, the patient passed two small, liquid stools.\\nOn the morning of the fifth hospital day, the temperature was 38.1°C. Gentle palpation of the abdomen revealed marked tenderness. Another stool specimen was negative for C. difficile toxin. On colonoscopic examination, the mucosa of the hepatic flexure and right side of the colon was purple.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. J. THOMAS LAMONT: May we review the radiologic findings?\\nDR. SUSANNA M.-K. LEE: The CT scan obtained after the rectal administration of contrast material shows concentric thickening of the ascending colon with stranding of the adjacent mesenteric fat and mesenteric nodes. The appendix and terminal ileum are normal.\\nDR. LAMONT: The differential diagnosis in this case mainly involves infectious forms of colitis. Because of the unusual endoscopic appearance of the right side of the colon, however, the differential diagnosis also includes causes of ischemic colitis (Table 3). Indeed, fresh or clotted blood in the submucosa, often manifested radiologically as “thumbprinting,” is most likely to cause edema of the colonic mucosa.\\n\\nIschemic Colitis\\nIschemic colitis occurs most often in elderly persons with serious cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, low-flow states, or mesenteric atherosclerosis. In young women with intestinal ischemia, one must consider venous thrombosis due to oral contraceptive pills or pregnancy, as well as other clotting disorders, but there is no evidence of a clotting disorder in this case. Clearly, the physicians caring for this patient considered the diagnosis of mesenteric venous thrombosis, but there was no evidence of venous thrombosis in the legs or right ovarian vein on imaging. Despite these normal findings, the physicians apparently thought the possibility of thrombosis of the mesenteric veins was sufficiently strong to warrant treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin.\\nTwo other diseases that can affect the mesenteric vascular system deserve comment. Systemic lupus erythematosus with or without the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome may be characterized by CT findings similar to those in this case as a result of vasculitis or the associated clotting disorder. This explanation is very unlikely in the absence of other evidence of lupus.\\nHenoch-Schönlein purpura is another form of multisystem vasculitis that can be manifested as acute abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding. Although primarily a disease of childhood, it is occasionally diagnosed in adults. Colicky pain, nausea, and vomiting are common, and these symptoms are associated with raised purpuric lesions in the mucosa of the small bowel. The few available endoscopic descriptions indicate that the purpuric lesions in the colon are discrete and focal in cases of small-vessel disease. Again, this diagnosis can be ruled out in the absence of other manifestations of the disease.\\n\\nInflammatory Colitis\\nSeveral acute or chronic inflammatory conditions may involve the right side of the colon and have some of the clinical features of this case. Typhlitis (inflammation of the cecum) was first described in children with severe neutropenia and was subsequently reported in adults with hematologic cancers, aplastic anemia, or chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The cardinal features of typhlitis are severe inflammation of the cecum with dilatation of the lumen, thickening of the wall, pneumatosis, and pericecal inflammation. This patient, however, did not have neutropenia. Crohn’s disease of the colon may cause pain, fever, and diarrhea, but in this case, the abrupt onset of the illness and the absence of linear or transverse ulcerations, a cobblestone appearance of the mucosa, and aphthous ulcers on endoscopic examination are strong evidence against the diagnosis. Similarly, the patient’s history provides no support for a diagnosis of tuberculosis, right colonic diverticulitis, or Meckel’s diverticulum.\\n\\nInfectious Colitis\\nThe suddenness and severity of the symptoms in this patient are characteristic of an acute infection. Several features of the history and clinical findings suggest the diagnosis of C. difficile colitis. The intravenous administration of clindamycin greatly increases the risk of C. difficile infection, which can follow even brief exposure to antibiotics given as prophylaxis for surgery.\\nThe possibility of C. difficile colitis was clearly of concern to this patient’s physicians, since they sent two stool samples for an assay of C. difficile toxin; both were negative. Moreover, the diagnosis of C. difficile colitis is not supported by the endoscopic or CT findings, nor is it consistent with the apparent lack of a response to the oral administration of metronidazole for five days. Shigella, campylobacter, and salmonella infections, which account for 10 to 20 percent of cases of community-acquired diarrhea, typically cause acute diarrhea, which may be bloody, accompanied by fever and abdominal pain, as in this patient. But a stool culture was negative for enteric pathogens, and the patient received ampicillin and gentamicin, which are active against at least some strains of shigella, salmonella, and campylobacter. A fluoroquinolone, however, would have been a better choice for empirical treatment of bacterial dysentery.\\nCampylobacter jejuni can cause pseudoappendicitis or an appendicular syndrome characterized by acute pain and tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, fever, and leukocytosis, with or without diarrhea. Nowadays, appendectomy is rarely performed without an initial ultrasonographic study of the abdomen to rule out disorders that mimic appendicitis. Abdominal imaging in patients with infectious pseudoappendicitis reveals thickening of the bowel wall due to edema and inflammation of the terminal ileum or cecum (“ileocecitis”), mesenteric adenitis, and fat stranding, with a normal-appearing appendix — features that are similar to the CT findings in this case.\\nUnlike acute appendicitis, acute infectious pseudoappendicitis is not associated with pain that migrates from the upper midabdomen to the right lower quadrant, and is usually not accompanied by rebound tenderness. The presence of diarrhea, especially watery diarrhea with an abrupt onset, which was noted in this patient, is a clue to the possibility of pseudoappendicitis due to infection. However, the failure to culture campylobacter from the patient’s stool and the absence of typical endoscopic findings, such as erythema, friability, mucosal erosions, and bleeding, argue against the diagnosis.\\nAcute Yersinia enterocolitica infection can also cause pseudoappendicitis and can mimic Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis as well. Yersiniosis is rare in eastern Massachusetts, but in other parts of the world it is often responsible for food- and water-borne outbreaks and sporadic infections in patients of all ages. The manifestations of disease caused by this organism are related to the age of the patient. In children 16 years of age or younger, the enteritis is usually mild, whereas in patients between the ages of 17 and 25 years, pseudoappendicitis is more common. Adults over the age of 25 years are more prone to complications such as abscesses, septicemia, chronic enteritis that mimics Crohn’s disease of the terminal ileum and proximal colon, reactive arthritis, and erythema nodosum. In this case, the persistent low-grade fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, accompanied by the CT findings of colonic-wall thickening and mesenteric fat stranding, are consistent with the diagnosis of yersiniosis. The diagnosis of Y. enterocolitica infection is based on either stool culture with common mediums or serologic tests. The yield of stool culture can be improved by incubation at 25°C rather than 37°C and by the use of mediums specifically designed to recover Y. enterocolitica. The case record does not mention whether these special culture techniques were used. The absence of a positive stool culture for yersinia on the day of admission does not rule out this infection, since the organism grows slowly at 37°C.\\nIn patients with yersiniosis, endoscopic examination of the bowel mucosa shows diffuse edema, aphthoid ulceration of the rectum, microulceration of the cecum, erythema, and friability. None of these features were noted in this case, and I could find no mention of a purplish caste to the mucosa in the literature on yersiniosis. There is a single case report of mesenteric venous thrombosis of the small intestine with small-bowel infarction and gangrene in a patient with yersinia enteritis.\\nAnother pathogen that causes acute diarrhea and that may involve the right side of the colon is cytomegalovirus. Such cases are manifested by watery or bloody diarrhea, with fever and abdominal pain. The endoscopic findings consist of erythema, edema, and ulceration of the mucosa, often in a segmental distribution. The CT features include thickening of the colonic wall, mucosal edema, pericolonic fat stranding, and lymphadenopathy, also often in a segmental distribution. A very unusual complication of cytomegalovirus colitis is ischemic colitis due to acute thrombosis of the colic veins, but cytomegalovirus colitis is rare in patients with a normal immune system.\\nFinally, infectious colitis due to enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (usually strain O157:H7) can mimic ischemic colitis. Ten percent of patients with severe colitis caused by this organism have the hemolytic–uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Involvement may be confined to the right side of the colon, suggesting acute appendicitis. The presence of blood in the stool is an important diagnostic clue, but in some patients with sporadic infection, the diarrhea is watery at first and later contains blood, which ranges from streaks to extensive hematochezia. Patients who do not have bloody stools are generally less ill than those who do and are less likely to have the hemolytic–uremic syndrome.\\nAlthough endoscopy is seldom performed in patients with enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection, the endoscopic findings are similar to those described in this case. The pathological findings in resected segments of colon can resemble those associated with infection or those associated with ischemia. Submucosal hemorrhage and edema, capillary microthrombi, and focal coagulative necrosis of the superficial mucosa suggest the presence of ischemia, and ulcers and crypt abscesses with intense neutrophilic infiltration tend to be more characteristic of infection.\\nThe diagnosis of enterohemorrhagic E. coli colitis depends primarily on the culture of E. coli O157:H7 from stool, which requires a special medium. Some hospitals do not routinely perform a culture for this pathogen if the stool specimen is not bloody. The diagnosis can also be based on the demonstration of Shiga-like toxins (verotoxins) in stool with the use of a tissue-culture assay similar to that used for the toxin of C. difficile. The assay for shiga-like toxin is somewhat more sensitive than culture. Moreover, the toxin persists in stool for up to 4 weeks, whereas viable organisms may survive in the stool for only 7 to 10 days.\\nAlthough the features in this case warrant a very broad differential diagnosis, I believe they are most consistent with the diagnosis of acute, right-sided colitis due to infection with E. coli O157:H7. A laparoscopy was probably performed to determine the viability of the right side of the colon.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\n? Inflammatory bowel disease.\\n\\nDR. J. THOMAS LAMONT’S DIAGNOSIS\\nAcute infectious colitis due to Escherichia coli O157:H7.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. FIONA M. GRAEME-COOK: The pathological specimen was a segment of cecum and ascending colon that was 13 cm long and a segment of normal-appearing terminal ileum that was 2 cm long. The entire colonic wall was thickened and edematous, and there was edema of the ileal and distal colonic mucosa. The mucosa of the proximal 7 cm of cecum and colon contained multiple well-circumscribed mucosal erosions, 1 to 2 cm in diameter.\\nMicroscopical examination of the colon revealed mucosal erosions that were superficial, with fibrinous exudate overlying a thin layer of granulation tissue; the submucosa was edematous, with dilated blood vessels, fibrin, and a mild inflammatory infiltrate (Fig. 2). Scattered crypt abscesses were present, with focal crypt rupture and a histiocytic reaction (Fig. 3). Examination of the margins of the erosions showed marked epithelial degeneration with minimal inflammation, a finding that is characteristic of ischemic mucosal damage. Fibrin thrombi were present at the base of the erosions, and in the mucosa, with the larger thrombi extending deeply into the submucosa.\\nA laparotomy, which was performed because of uncontrollable pain, revealed marked edema of the right side of the colon without evidence of peritonitis, perforation, or serosal involvement. A right-sided hemicolectomy was performed. The diagnostic procedure was a culture of a stool specimen obtained during the operation, with sensitivity testing. Routine plating on MacConkey agar revealed a non–lactose-fermenting bacterium, subsequently identified as salmonella species on the basis of its pattern of sugar fermentation. Analysis of O antigens showed that the organism belonged to serogroup C2, and the specimen was sent to the state laboratory for identification of the species with the use of H (flagellar) antigen. The organism was identified as Salmonella newport. The histologic features are entirely consistent with the diagnosis of salmonella colitis.\\nSalmonella infection, including nontyphoidal salmonellosis, usually causes disease of the small intestine, but cases of colonic involvement have been reported; these cases may mimic inflammatory bowel disease. Many salmonella species have been implicated in cases of both distal and proximal colonic disease, without any link between the pattern of involvement and the particular species. S. newport infection, which can cause either right- or left-sided colonic disease, usually has a good overall prognosis.\\nThe minimal inoculum for intestinal salmonellosis is approximately 1 million organisms; prior antibiotic therapy reduces the minimal inoculum, possibly because of the loss of normal enteric flora.\\nS. newport is a relatively common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis. The organism is found in animals, and contaminated food is a major source of infection. Fowl, mostly chickens and ducks, are often implicated in salmonella infections, but many outbreaks have been linked to beef, and some to pork. Pets, including turtles, have been the source of the organisms in some cases.\\nDR. ESTHER ISRAEL: We do not know how this patient acquired the organism. We initially treated her with ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole. The organism was resistant to ampicillin and cefazolin and was sensitive to imipenem, levofloxacin, ticarcillin, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. Her medications were changed to orally administered vancomycin and, later, orally administered trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her condition improved over the next two days, and she was discharged. She is currently well.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

Her postpartum course was uneventful, and she was discharged on the third postoperative day.\\nThree days before admission, the patient began to have pain in the right lower quadrant of her abdomen. The pain became more severe the next day and was accompanied by very frequent, watery stools that were brown and later black, nausea, and a temperature that peaked at 38.3°C. She passed no fresh blood. One day before admission, 2 liters of fluid with electrolytes was administered intravenously. On the day of admission, the pain became more severe and was unrelieved by acetaminophen–oxycodone, although the diarrhea had ceased.\\nThe patient did not have a history of previous abdominal pain or exposure to patients with gastroenteritis, and there was no family history of inflammatory bowel disease. She resided in eastern Massachusetts.\\nThe temperature was 38.7°C, the pulse was 104, and the respirations were 16. The blood pressure was 130/70 mm Hg.\\nOn examination, the patient was in considerable pain. Her abdomen was soft but exquisitely tender in the right lower quadrant, without rebound tenderness; bowel sounds were diminished. A stool specimen contained occult blood.\\nThe urine was normal; the sediment contained 0 to 2 red cells and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field. The results of hematologic studies performed at various times during the hospital stay are shown in Table 1. Blood chemical values were normal. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the rectal administration of contrast material (Fig. 1), revealed concentric thickening of the wall of the cecum and proximal ascending colon, with fat stranding and prominent lymph nodes in the adjacent mesentery. A transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonographic study of the pelvis showed no abnormalities.\\nMorphine was given intravenously. A blood specimen and a rectal swab were obtained for culture. Ampicillin, gentamicin, and fluid and electrolytes were administered intravenously; heparin was injected subcutaneously, and metronidazole was given orally. Total parenteral nutrition was instituted. The temperature rose to 39.1°C on the first hospital day. The uterus was not tender; its size corresponded to a 12-week gestation; there was no discharge.\\nOn the second hospital day, the temperature rose to 38.8°C. Blood chemical tests were performed on this day and subsequently during the hospital course (Table 2). An abdominal radiograph showed no abnormalities. The administration of analgesia, controlled by the patient, was begun. The pain improved briefly, but the patient refused abdominal examination because of extreme tenderness.\\nOn the third hospital day, the patient passed a voluminous brown, watery stool, with a subsequent increase in abdominal pain. The temperature was 38.2°C. The findings on physical examination were unchanged. Colonoscopic examination, which had to be discontinued at the splenic flexure because of the presence of stool, showed no abnormalities. A biopsy specimen was obtained. A stool sample was negative for Clostridium difficile toxin. An ultrasonographic study of the legs showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the intravenous and oral administration of contrast material, showed concentric thickening of the colon from the cecum to the hepatic flexure, with adjacent fat stranding. There was normal enhancement of the right ovarian vein; filling defects, a sign of thrombosis, were absent. Low-molecular-weight heparin was substituted for heparin. Later in the day, the patient passed two small, liquid stools.\\nOn the morning of the fifth hospital day, the temperature was 38.1°C. Gentle palpation of the abdomen revealed marked tenderness. Another stool specimen was negative for C. difficile toxin. On colonoscopic examination, the mucosa of the hepatic flexure and right side of the colon was purple.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. J. THOMAS LAMONT: May we review the radiologic findings?\\nDR. SUSANNA M.-K. LEE: The CT scan obtained after the rectal administration of contrast material shows concentric thickening of the ascending colon with stranding of the adjacent mesenteric fat and mesenteric nodes. The appendix and terminal ileum are normal.\\nDR. LAMONT: The differential diagnosis in this case mainly involves infectious forms of colitis. Because of the unusual endoscopic appearance of the right side of the colon, however, the differential diagnosis also includes causes of ischemic colitis (Table 3). Indeed, fresh or clotted blood in the submucosa, often manifested radiologically as “thumbprinting,” is most likely to cause edema of the colonic mucosa.\\n\\nIschemic Colitis\\nIschemic colitis occurs most often in elderly persons with serious cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, low-flow states, or mesenteric atherosclerosis. In young women with intestinal ischemia, one must consider venous thrombosis due to oral contraceptive pills or pregnancy, as well as other clotting disorders, but there is no evidence of a clotting disorder in this case. Clearly, the physicians caring for this patient considered the diagnosis of mesenteric venous thrombosis, but there was no evidence of venous thrombosis in the legs or right ovarian vein on imaging. Despite these normal findings, the physicians apparently thought the possibility of thrombosis of the mesenteric veins was sufficiently strong to warrant treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin.\\nTwo other diseases that can affect the mesenteric vascular system deserve comment. Systemic lupus erythematosus with or without the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome may be characterized by CT findings similar to those in this case as a result of vasculitis or the associated clotting disorder. This explanation is very unlikely in the absence of other evidence of lupus.\\nHenoch-Schönlein purpura is another form of multisystem vasculitis that can be manifested as acute abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding. Although primarily a disease of childhood, it is occasionally diagnosed in adults. Colicky pain, nausea, and vomiting are common, and these symptoms are associated with raised purpuric lesions in the mucosa of the small bowel. The few available endoscopic descriptions indicate that the purpuric lesions in the colon are discrete and focal in cases of small-vessel disease. Again, this diagnosis can be ruled out in the absence of other manifestations of the disease.\\n\\nInflammatory Colitis\\nSeveral acute or chronic inflammatory conditions may involve the right side of the colon and have some of the clinical features of this case. Typhlitis (inflammation of the cecum) was first described in children with severe neutropenia and was subsequently reported in adults with hematologic cancers, aplastic anemia, or chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The cardinal features of typhlitis are severe inflammation of the cecum with dilatation of the lumen, thickening of the wall, pneumatosis, and pericecal inflammation. This patient, however, did not have neutropenia. Crohn’s disease of the colon may cause pain, fever, and diarrhea, but in this case, the abrupt onset of the illness and the absence of linear or transverse ulcerations, a cobblestone appearance of the mucosa, and aphthous ulcers on endoscopic examination are strong evidence against the diagnosis. Similarly, the patient’s history provides no support for a diagnosis of tuberculosis, right colonic diverticulitis, or Meckel’s diverticulum.\\n\\nInfectious Colitis\\nThe suddenness and severity of the symptoms in this patient are characteristic of an acute infection. Several features of the history and clinical findings suggest the diagnosis of C. difficile colitis. The intravenous administration of clindamycin greatly increases the risk of C. difficile infection, which can follow even brief exposure to antibiotics given as prophylaxis for surgery.\\nThe possibility of C. difficile colitis was clearly of concern to this patient’s physicians, since they sent two stool samples for an assay of C. difficile toxin; both were negative. Moreover, the diagnosis of C. difficile colitis is not supported by the endoscopic or CT findings, nor is it consistent with the apparent lack of a response to the oral administration of metronidazole for five days. Shigella, campylobacter, and salmonella infections, which account for 10 to 20 percent of cases of community-acquired diarrhea, typically cause acute diarrhea, which may be bloody, accompanied by fever and abdominal pain, as in this patient. But a stool culture was negative for enteric pathogens, and the patient received ampicillin and gentamicin, which are active against at least some strains of shigella, salmonella, and campylobacter. A fluoroquinolone, however, would have been a better choice for empirical treatment of bacterial dysentery.\\nCampylobacter jejuni can cause pseudoappendicitis or an appendicular syndrome characterized by acute pain and tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, fever, and leukocytosis, with or without diarrhea. Nowadays, appendectomy is rarely performed without an initial ultrasonographic study of the abdomen to rule out disorders that mimic appendicitis. Abdominal imaging in patients with infectious pseudoappendicitis reveals thickening of the bowel wall due to edema and inflammation of the terminal ileum or cecum (“ileocecitis”), mesenteric adenitis, and fat stranding, with a normal-appearing appendix — features that are similar to the CT findings in this case.\\nUnlike acute appendicitis, acute infectious pseudoappendicitis is not associated with pain that migrates from the upper midabdomen to the right lower quadrant, and is usually not accompanied by rebound tenderness. The presence of diarrhea, especially watery diarrhea with an abrupt onset, which was noted in this patient, is a clue to the possibility of pseudoappendicitis due to infection. However, the failure to culture campylobacter from the patient’s stool and the absence of typical endoscopic findings, such as erythema, friability, mucosal erosions, and bleeding, argue against the diagnosis.\\nAcute Yersinia enterocolitica infection can also cause pseudoappendicitis and can mimic Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis as well. Yersiniosis is rare in eastern Massachusetts, but in other parts of the world it is often responsible for food- and water-borne outbreaks and sporadic infections in patients of all ages. The manifestations of disease caused by this organism are related to the age of the patient. In children 16 years of age or younger, the enteritis is usually mild, whereas in patients between the ages of 17 and 25 years, pseudoappendicitis is more common. Adults over the age of 25 years are more prone to complications such as abscesses, septicemia, chronic enteritis that mimics Crohn’s disease of the terminal ileum and proximal colon, reactive arthritis, and erythema nodosum. In this case, the persistent low-grade fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, accompanied by the CT findings of colonic-wall thickening and mesenteric fat stranding, are consistent with the diagnosis of yersiniosis. The diagnosis of Y. enterocolitica infection is based on either stool culture with common mediums or serologic tests. The yield of stool culture can be improved by incubation at 25°C rather than 37°C and by the use of mediums specifically designed to recover Y. enterocolitica. The case record does not mention whether these special culture techniques were used. The absence of a positive stool culture for yersinia on the day of admission does not rule out this infection, since the organism grows slowly at 37°C.\\nIn patients with yersiniosis, endoscopic examination of the bowel mucosa shows diffuse edema, aphthoid ulceration of the rectum, microulceration of the cecum, erythema, and friability. None of these features were noted in this case, and I could find no mention of a purplish caste to the mucosa in the literature on yersiniosis. There is a single case report of mesenteric venous thrombosis of the small intestine with small-bowel infarction and gangrene in a patient with yersinia enteritis.\\nAnother pathogen that causes acute diarrhea and that may involve the right side of the colon is cytomegalovirus. Such cases are manifested by watery or bloody diarrhea, with fever and abdominal pain. The endoscopic findings consist of erythema, edema, and ulceration of the mucosa, often in a segmental distribution. The CT features include thickening of the colonic wall, mucosal edema, pericolonic fat stranding, and lymphadenopathy, also often in a segmental distribution. A very unusual complication of cytomegalovirus colitis is ischemic colitis due to acute thrombosis of the colic veins, but cytomegalovirus colitis is rare in patients with a normal immune system.\\nFinally, infectious colitis due to enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (usually strain O157:H7) can mimic ischemic colitis. Ten percent of patients with severe colitis caused by this organism have the hemolytic–uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Involvement may be confined to the right side of the colon, suggesting acute appendicitis. The presence of blood in the stool is an important diagnostic clue, but in some patients with sporadic infection, the diarrhea is watery at first and later contains blood, which ranges from streaks to extensive hematochezia. Patients who do not have bloody stools are generally less ill than those who do and are less likely to have the hemolytic–uremic syndrome.\\nAlthough endoscopy is seldom performed in patients with enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection, the endoscopic findings are similar to those described in this case. The pathological findings in resected segments of colon can resemble those associated with infection or those associated with ischemia. Submucosal hemorrhage and edema, capillary microthrombi, and focal coagulative necrosis of the superficial mucosa suggest the presence of ischemia, and ulcers and crypt abscesses with intense neutrophilic infiltration tend to be more characteristic of infection.\\nThe diagnosis of enterohemorrhagic E. coli colitis depends primarily on the culture of E. coli O157:H7 from stool, which requires a special medium. Some hospitals do not routinely perform a culture for this pathogen if the stool specimen is not bloody. The diagnosis can also be based on the demonstration of Shiga-like toxins (verotoxins) in stool with the use of a tissue-culture assay similar to that used for the toxin of C. difficile. The assay for shiga-like toxin is somewhat more sensitive than culture. Moreover, the toxin persists in stool for up to 4 weeks, whereas viable organisms may survive in the stool for only 7 to 10 days.\\nAlthough the features in this case warrant a very broad differential diagnosis, I believe they are most consistent with the diagnosis of acute, right-sided colitis due to infection with E. coli O157:H7. A laparoscopy was probably performed to determine the viability of the right side of the colon.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\n? Inflammatory bowel disease.\\n\\nDR. J. THOMAS LAMONT’S DIAGNOSIS\\nAcute infectious colitis due to Escherichia coli O157:H7.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. FIONA M. GRAEME-COOK: The pathological specimen was a segment of cecum and ascending colon that was 13 cm long and a segment of normal-appearing terminal ileum that was 2 cm long. The entire colonic wall was thickened and edematous, and there was edema of the ileal and distal colonic mucosa. The mucosa of the proximal 7 cm of cecum and colon contained multiple well-circumscribed mucosal erosions, 1 to 2 cm in diameter.\\nMicroscopical examination of the colon revealed mucosal erosions that were superficial, with fibrinous exudate overlying a thin layer of granulation tissue; the submucosa was edematous, with dilated blood vessels, fibrin, and a mild inflammatory infiltrate (Fig. 2). Scattered crypt abscesses were present, with focal crypt rupture and a histiocytic reaction (Fig. 3). Examination of the margins of the erosions showed marked epithelial degeneration with minimal inflammation, a finding that is characteristic of ischemic mucosal damage. Fibrin thrombi were present at the base of the erosions, and in the mucosa, with the larger thrombi extending deeply into the submucosa.\\nA laparotomy, which was performed because of uncontrollable pain, revealed marked edema of the right side of the colon without evidence of peritonitis, perforation, or serosal involvement. A right-sided hemicolectomy was performed. The diagnostic procedure was a culture of a stool specimen obtained during the operation, with sensitivity testing. Routine plating on MacConkey agar revealed a non–lactose-fermenting bacterium, subsequently identified as salmonella species on the basis of its pattern of sugar fermentation. Analysis of O antigens showed that the organism belonged to serogroup C2, and the specimen was sent to the state laboratory for identification of the species with the use of H (flagellar) antigen. The organism was identified as Salmonella newport. The histologic features are entirely consistent with the diagnosis of salmonella colitis.\\nSalmonella infection, including nontyphoidal salmonellosis, usually causes disease of the small intestine, but cases of colonic involvement have been reported; these cases may mimic inflammatory bowel disease. Many salmonella species have been implicated in cases of both distal and proximal colonic disease, without any link between the pattern of involvement and the particular species. S. newport infection, which can cause either right- or left-sided colonic disease, usually has a good overall prognosis.\\nThe minimal inoculum for intestinal salmonellosis is approximately 1 million organisms; prior antibiotic therapy reduces the minimal inoculum, possibly because of the loss of normal enteric flora.\\nS. newport is a relatively common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis. The organism is found in animals, and contaminated food is a major source of infection. Fowl, mostly chickens and ducks, are often implicated in salmonella infections, but many outbreaks have been linked to beef, and some to pork. Pets, including turtles, have been the source of the organisms in some cases.\\nDR. ESTHER ISRAEL: We do not know how this patient acquired the organism. We initially treated her with ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole. The organism was resistant to ampicillin and cefazolin and was sensitive to imipenem, levofloxacin, ticarcillin, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. Her medications were changed to orally administered vancomycin and, later, orally administered trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Her condition improved over the next two days, and she was discharged.

DISEASES IN THE\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS.\\nInfectious diseases\\nBacterial\\nFungal\\nViral\\nDiseases due to molecular mimicry\\nInflammatory (noninfectious) disorders\\nAdult Still's disease\\nRheumatoid arthritis\\nRelapsing polychondritis\\nWegener's granulomatosis\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\\n5). Infections require prompt antimicrobial therapy to\\nprevent joint damage, which, depending on the patho-\\ngen, can occur quickly. I shall focus on them first.\\nBacterial Infections\\nBacterial infections such as those due to gram-neg-\\native organisms can cause rapid joint destruction.1\\nSeptic arthritis is almost always monoarticular or oli-\\ngoarticular, predominantly involving large joints. Poly-\\narticular septic arthritis may occur in patients with\\nunderlying rheumatoid arthritis or other connective-\\ntissue diseases or in patients with overwhelming\\nsepsis.2 Disseminated gonococcal infection may be\\nmanifested either as migratory polyarthritis and teno-\\nsynovitis with pustular or vesicular skin lesions and\\nfever³ or as an asymmetric polyarthritis without skin\\nlesions or fever. The clinical features of this case are\\nnot consistent with either description. Arthritis due\\nto mycobacteria or fungi can be ruled out for similar\\nreasons.\\nInfectious endocarditis may be manifested as acute\\narthritis, which is also monoarticular or oligoarticular,\\nwith a predilection for large joints. Although this pa-\\ntient had a systolic murmur, an echocardiographic\\nstudy showed no valvular vegetations.\\nLyme disease may be manifested as migratory pol-\\nyarthralgia. Large-joint monoarthritis is a late man-\\nifestation of the infection, but polyarthritis would\\nbe an exceptional finding. Serologic tests for Borrelia\\nburgdorferi antibodies are usually positive in patients\\nwith arthritis, but the test in this patient was negative.\\nViral Infections\\nThe manifestations in the joints of some viral infec-\\ntions, most often those due to parvovirus, rubella, the\\nhepatitis viruses, and the human immunodeficiency\\nvirus (HIV), are characterized by the sudden onset of\\npolyarthritis involving the small joints of the hands,\\nfrequently accompanied by a rash. Parvovirus B19 in-\\nfection, which is more common in women than in\\nmen,5 is generally manifested as fever, headache, sore\\nthroat, cough, and other respiratory tract symptoms.\\nA malar, erythematous rash gives the characteristic\\nappearance of slapped cheeks in children but may be\\nabsent in adults. The joint symptoms may remit and\\nrelapse over many months, and there may be transient\\nanemia. The diagnosis is confirmed by serologic de-\\ntection of IgM antibodies against the parvovirus. Al-\\nthough this test was not performed in this case, parvo-\\nvirus B19 infection is unlikely because of the severity\\nof the patient's arthritis and his persistent fever. The\\nnegative results of tests for the hepatitis viruses and\\nHIV rule them out as well.\\nDiseases Due to Molecular Mimicry\\nAt the interface of infections and inflammatory con-\\nditions are disorders due to molecular mimicry, which\\nare thought to result from the mimicry of host pro-\\nteins by antigens of the infectious agent. Examples\\ninclude the aseptic arthritis that may develop after in-\\nfection with organisms such as shigella, salmonella,\\nyersinia, and campylobacter.6 In these disorders, the ar-\\nthritis is aseptic that is, triggered by an infectious\\nagent located outside the joint. There is often evidence\\nof an antecedent infection, with genitourinary or gas-\\ntrointestinal symptoms followed shortly by the onset\\nof an oligoarticular, asymmetric arthritis, predominant-\\nly involving the joints of the legs. The pathogenesis\\nof these forms of arthritis has not been elucidated.7\\nCould this patient have had acute rheumatic fever\\nor poststreptococcal arthritis? His history suggests\\nthe presence of an upper respiratory tract infection,\\nwhich was followed by the development of polyarthri-\\ntis and a persistent fever. The last two findings are\\namong the major and minor Jones criteria for the di-\\nagnosis of rheumatic fever, respectively. However, the\\nother major criteria, such as carditis, chorea, and rash,\\nare absent.\\nInflammatory (Noninfectious) Diseases\\nAdult Still's disease is characterized by arthritis, an\\nevanescent rash, and a high temperature with a daily\\nspike.9,10 The high temperature may prompt an initial,\\nexhaustive evaluation for an infectious cause, delaying\\nthe diagnosis. The joint findings range from mild-to-\\nsevere, occasionally symmetric polyarthritis involving\\nboth large and small joints. Severe laryngitis is com-\\nmon.11 However, this patient did not have other\\ncommon features of adult Still's disease, such as lym-\\nphadenopathy, leukocytosis, abnormal results of liver-\\nfunction tests, and a marked elevation of the serum\\nferritin level12; the slight elevation of his ferritin level\\nis consistent with the presence of acute inflammation.\\nArticular involvement in rheumatoid arthritis is\\ncharacteristically symmetric and polyarticular, involv-\\ning many small and large joints, with involvement of\\nthe wrists and hands in about 90 percent of cases.13 Al-\\nthough the onset is usually insidious, some patients,\\nmany of whom are elderly men, have an explosive\\npolyarthritis, as this patient had, with marked pitting\\nN Engl J Med, Vol. 344, No. 25 June 21, 2001 www.nejm.org 1931\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Rheumatoid arthritis may explain\\nthis patient's polyarthritis, but his persistent fever\\nand sweats are uncharacteristic of that diagnosis, and\\nit does not account for his upper respiratory tract\\nsymptoms.\\nRelapsing polychondritis is characterized by inflam-\\nmation of cartilage at various sites, including joints,\\nbut the joint disease is usually mild, 16 as it is in Weg-\\nener's granulomatosis and other vasculitides.\\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus\\nThe one remaining noninfectious inflammatory\\ndisease in the differential diagnosis is systemic lupus\\nerythematosus. This multisystem disease has protean\\nclinical and laboratory manifestations.17 At first glance,\\nthe disorder seems unlikely in this case, because only\\n10 percent of affected persons are male. Middle-aged\\nmen with the disease generally have a form that is re-\\nlated to the use of the antiarrhythmic agents procain-\\namide and quinidine or antihypertensive medication\\nsuch as hydralazine, 18 none of which this patient took.\\nThe 1982 revised criteria for the diagnosis of sys-\\ntemic lupus erythematosus19 include 11 major clini-\\ncal and laboratory findings (Table 6), at least 4 of\\nwhich must be present. This case lacks most of the\\ncharacteristic features of the disease but meets some\\nof the criteria. The patient's arthritis is consistent with\\nthe presence of lupus. Arthritis, arthralgias, or both\\nare the initial manifestations in over half the cases, 20\\ntypically with symmetric involvement of the small\\njoints of the hands, wrists, and knees and little or no\\njoint effusion. Although not considered diagnostic cri-\\nteria, the persistent fever, sweats, and malaise in this\\npatient are probably manifestations of systemic lupus\\nerythematosus, particularly since microbiologic cul-\\ntures were repeatedly negative. Laryngitis, 21 conjunc-\\ntivitis, 22 retinal cotton-wool spots, 23 and patchy pul-\\nmonary opacities 24 all features of this patient's\\nillness- have also been described in association with\\nlupus. Anemia with a positive Coombs' test and lym-\\nphopenia are hematologic diagnostic criteria. How-\\never, the findings in this case are not sufficient to es-\\ntablish the presence of lupus. Confirmation of the\\ndiagnosis requires testing for various antibodies that\\nare usually associated with the disease, such as antinu-\\nclear antibodies or antibodies against double-stranded\\nDNA or antibodies against the Sm antigen, which are\\nhighly specific for the diagnosis, as well as antibodies\\nagainst the Ro and La antigens.25\\nTABLE 6.

Although the pres-\\nence of inflammatory cells in synovial fluid is nonspe-\\ncific, the finding of two unusual types of cells deserves\\ncomment. The nonhematic cells, which may be syn-\\novial lining cells, are probably not relevant to the di-\\nagnosis.

ALEXANDER KRATZ: The diagnostic proce-\\ndure was serologic testing for antinuclear antibodies.\\nIn an indirect immunofluorescence assay with Hep-2\\ncells serving as the substrate, serum from the patient\\nshowed homogeneous staining of the entire nucleus\\nin interphase (Fig. 2), up to a dilution of 1:5120. This\\npattern of staining, which is caused by antibodies\\nagainst DNA, histone proteins, or the DNA-histone\\ncomplex, can be seen in a variety of connective-tissue\\ndiseases but is most often associated with systemic\\nlupus erythematosus.\\nAdditional testing for antibodies against double-\\nstranded DNA and for antibodies against the Sm, Ro,\\nLa, and RNP antigens was requested by the patient's\\nphysicians. The test for antibodies against double-\\nstranded DNA, performed as an indirect immunofluo-\\nrescence assay with the hemoflagellate Crithidia lu-\\nciliae as the substrate, was positive at a dilution of 1:40\\n(Fig. 3). Tests for the other antibodies, performed as\\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), were\\nnegative (Table 7).\\nThe positive test for antinuclear antibodies has to\\nbe interpreted in the context of the patient's age, his\\nuse of drugs known to induce these antibodies, the\\nhigh titer, and most important, the clinical picture. 33\\nPositive test results at low titers are common in per-\\nsons over the age of 60 years who do not have evi-\\ndence of connective-tissue disease. Since this patient\\nwas only 50 years old and had a high titer of antinu-\\nclear antibodies as well as a positive test for antibodies\\nagainst double-stranded DNA, age can be ruled out as\\nthe explanation for his positive antinuclear-antibody\\ntest. On admission, the patient was taking only ibupro-\\nfen and penicillin V. Although ibuprofen is known to\\nexacerbate the symptoms of idiopathic lupus, only a\\nsingle case of lupus-like syndrome due to ibuprofen\\nhypersensitivity has been reported.34 The possibility\\nthat penicillin induces lupus has been raised,35 but this\\npatient's symptoms antedated his penicillin therapy,\\nand antibodies against double-stranded DNA are usu-\\nally not detected in cases of drug-related lupus.\\nFigure 3.

Since patients\\nwith certain connective-tissue diseases often have pos-\\nitive tests for various other antibodies, the specificity of\\nserologic testing can be increased by ordering tests for\\nappropriate autoantibodies, as was done in this case.\\nIn summary, the serologic findings in this patient,\\nin conjunction with the clinical presentation, warrant\\nthe diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.\\nDR. ROBERT E. SCULLY: Dr. Costenbader, do you\\nhave follow-up information?\\nDR. KAREN COSTENBADER: We also diagnosed sys-\\ntemic lupus erythematosus. We administered predni-\\nsone (40 mg given orally once a day), as well as hy-\\ndroxychloroquine (200 mg given orally twice a day).\\nBy the next day, the patient was afebrile, and he was\\ndischarged home two days later. The dose of predni-\\nsone was subsequently tapered to 5 mg a day. He has\\ncontinued to take hydroxychloroquine, and a nonste-\\nroidal antiinflammatory drug was added for an episode\\nof bilateral scleritis. His arthritis and systemic symp-\\ntoms have disappeared, and the only problem has been\\nweight gain due to the prednisone.\\nDR. KURT J. BLOCH: The blood test for LE cells\\nis used infrequently. For the test to be positive, the in-\\ngested LE body (i.e., a transformed nucleus) must ap-\\npear completely homogeneous. LE cells are rarely de-\\ntected in circulating blood in patients with lupus, but\\nthey may be seen on smears of pericardial, pleural,\\nperitoneal, joint, and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as in\\nblister fluid, from patients with the disease, providing\\nstrong support for the diagnosis of lupus.38\\nAntibodies against Sm antigen are detected by pre-\\ncipitin tests with rabbit-thymus extracts used as anti-\\ngen and are considered markers for systemic lupus\\nerythematosus. Although investigators have claimed\\nthat even with sensitive ELISAs there is no loss of\\nspecificity,39 our experience suggests that some pa-\\ntients with antibodies against Sm antigen detected by\\nELISA do not have lupus.\\nWe routinely retest all ELISA-positive serum by gel\\ndiffusion; if the test remains positive, we assume that\\nthe patient has systemic lupus erythematosus. How-\\never, not all antibodies against Sm precipitate in gel\\nwith their corresponding antigens. Hence, a patient\\nwith a positive ELISA for antibodies against Sm but\\na negative gel-diffusion test may still have systemic\\nlupus erythematosus.\\n1934\\nN Engl J Med, Vol. 344, No. 25 June 21, 2001\\nwww.nejm.org\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

      "Answer: \n",
      "Based on the patient's presentation of fever, arthralgias, sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache, low-grade fever, followed by a recurrence of fever, night sweats, and rigors, and then pain in the right elbow and knees, followed by joint pain and edema in the hands and feet, along with negative blood cultures and a negative tuberculin skin test, the most likely diagnosis is **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Information Gathering:** The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms including fever, arthralgias, and a history of a preceding upper respiratory infection. The presence of a cotton-wool spot in the retina, joint pain and swelling, and a positive urine protein suggests a systemic inflammatory process. The negative blood cultures and tuberculin skin test make infectious etiologies less likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The differential diagnosis includes infectious diseases (e.g., viral infections, bacterial infections), inflammatory diseases (e.g., adult-onset Still's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, relapsing polychondritis, Wegener's granulomatosis), and other autoimmune disorders (e.g., SLE).\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hypothesis Testing:** The negative blood cultures and tuberculin skin test make infectious etiologies less likely. The presence of a cotton-wool spot in the retina is suggestive of SLE. The joint pain and swelling are consistent with SLE. The positive urine protein is also consistent with SLE. The negative tests for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus make these infections less likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:** The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of SLE. The positive antinuclear antibody test further supports this diagnosis. The negative blood cultures and tuberculin skin test make infectious etiologies less likely.\n",

DISEASES IN THE\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS.\\nInfectious diseases\\nBacterial\\nFungal\\nViral\\nDiseases due to molecular mimicry\\nInflammatory (noninfectious) disorders\\nAdult Still's disease\\nRheumatoid arthritis\\nRelapsing polychondritis\\nWegener's granulomatosis\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\\n5). Infections require prompt antimicrobial therapy to\\nprevent joint damage, which, depending on the patho-\\ngen, can occur quickly. I shall focus on them first.\\nBacterial Infections\\nBacterial infections such as those due to gram-neg-\\native organisms can cause rapid joint destruction.1\\nSeptic arthritis is almost always monoarticular or oli-\\ngoarticular, predominantly involving large joints. Poly-\\narticular septic arthritis may occur in patients with\\nunderlying rheumatoid arthritis or other connective-\\ntissue diseases or in patients with overwhelming\\nsepsis.2 Disseminated gonococcal infection may be\\nmanifested either as migratory polyarthritis and teno-\\nsynovitis with pustular or vesicular skin lesions and\\nfever³ or as an asymmetric polyarthritis without skin\\nlesions or fever. The clinical features of this case are\\nnot consistent with either description. Arthritis due\\nto mycobacteria or fungi can be ruled out for similar\\nreasons.\\nInfectious endocarditis may be manifested as acute\\narthritis, which is also monoarticular or oligoarticular,\\nwith a predilection for large joints. Although this pa-\\ntient had a systolic murmur, an echocardiographic\\nstudy showed no valvular vegetations.\\nLyme disease may be manifested as migratory pol-\\nyarthralgia. Large-joint monoarthritis is a late man-\\nifestation of the infection, but polyarthritis would\\nbe an exceptional finding. Serologic tests for Borrelia\\nburgdorferi antibodies are usually positive in patients\\nwith arthritis, but the test in this patient was negative.\\nViral Infections\\nThe manifestations in the joints of some viral infec-\\ntions, most often those due to parvovirus, rubella, the\\nhepatitis viruses, and the human immunodeficiency\\nvirus (HIV), are characterized by the sudden onset of\\npolyarthritis involving the small joints of the hands,\\nfrequently accompanied by a rash. Parvovirus B19 in-\\nfection, which is more common in women than in\\nmen,5 is generally manifested as fever, headache, sore\\nthroat, cough, and other respiratory tract symptoms.\\nA malar, erythematous rash gives the characteristic\\nappearance of slapped cheeks in children but may be\\nabsent in adults. The joint symptoms may remit and\\nrelapse over many months, and there may be transient\\nanemia. The diagnosis is confirmed by serologic de-\\ntection of IgM antibodies against the parvovirus. Al-\\nthough this test was not performed in this case, parvo-\\nvirus B19 infection is unlikely because of the severity\\nof the patient's arthritis and his persistent fever. The\\nnegative results of tests for the hepatitis viruses and\\nHIV rule them out as well.\\nDiseases Due to Molecular Mimicry\\nAt the interface of infections and inflammatory con-\\nditions are disorders due to molecular mimicry, which\\nare thought to result from the mimicry of host pro-\\nteins by antigens of the infectious agent. Examples\\ninclude the aseptic arthritis that may develop after in-\\nfection with organisms such as shigella, salmonella,\\nyersinia, and campylobacter.6 In these disorders, the ar-\\nthritis is aseptic that is, triggered by an infectious\\nagent located outside the joint. There is often evidence\\nof an antecedent infection, with genitourinary or gas-\\ntrointestinal symptoms followed shortly by the onset\\nof an oligoarticular, asymmetric arthritis, predominant-\\nly involving the joints of the legs. The pathogenesis\\nof these forms of arthritis has not been elucidated.7\\nCould this patient have had acute rheumatic fever\\nor poststreptococcal arthritis? His history suggests\\nthe presence of an upper respiratory tract infection,\\nwhich was followed by the development of polyarthri-\\ntis and a persistent fever. The last two findings are\\namong the major and minor Jones criteria for the di-\\nagnosis of rheumatic fever, respectively. However, the\\nother major criteria, such as carditis, chorea, and rash,\\nare absent.\\nInflammatory (Noninfectious) Diseases\\nAdult Still's disease is characterized by arthritis, an\\nevanescent rash, and a high temperature with a daily\\nspike.9,10 The high temperature may prompt an initial,\\nexhaustive evaluation for an infectious cause, delaying\\nthe diagnosis. The joint findings range from mild-to-\\nsevere, occasionally symmetric polyarthritis involving\\nboth large and small joints. Severe laryngitis is com-\\nmon.11 However, this patient did not have other\\ncommon features of adult Still's disease, such as lym-\\nphadenopathy, leukocytosis, abnormal results of liver-\\nfunction tests, and a marked elevation of the serum\\nferritin level12; the slight elevation of his ferritin level\\nis consistent with the presence of acute inflammation.\\nArticular involvement in rheumatoid arthritis is\\ncharacteristically symmetric and polyarticular, involv-\\ning many small and large joints, with involvement of\\nthe wrists and hands in about 90 percent of cases.13 Al-\\nthough the onset is usually insidious, some patients,\\nmany of whom are elderly men, have an explosive\\npolyarthritis, as this patient had, with marked pitting\\nN Engl J Med, Vol. 344, No. 25 June 21, 2001 www.nejm.org 1931\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Rheumatoid arthritis may explain\\nthis patient's polyarthritis, but his persistent fever\\nand sweats are uncharacteristic of that diagnosis, and\\nit does not account for his upper respiratory tract\\nsymptoms.\\nRelapsing polychondritis is characterized by inflam-\\nmation of cartilage at various sites, including joints,\\nbut the joint disease is usually mild, 16 as it is in Weg-\\nener's granulomatosis and other vasculitides.\\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus\\nThe one remaining noninfectious inflammatory\\ndisease in the differential diagnosis is systemic lupus\\nerythematosus. This multisystem disease has protean\\nclinical and laboratory manifestations.17 At first glance,\\nthe disorder seems unlikely in this case, because only\\n10 percent of affected persons are male. Middle-aged\\nmen with the disease generally have a form that is re-\\nlated to the use of the antiarrhythmic agents procain-\\namide and quinidine or antihypertensive medication\\nsuch as hydralazine, 18 none of which this patient took.\\nThe 1982 revised criteria for the diagnosis of sys-\\ntemic lupus erythematosus19 include 11 major clini-\\ncal and laboratory findings (Table 6), at least 4 of\\nwhich must be present. This case lacks most of the\\ncharacteristic features of the disease but meets some\\nof the criteria. The patient's arthritis is consistent with\\nthe presence of lupus. Arthritis, arthralgias, or both\\nare the initial manifestations in over half the cases, 20\\ntypically with symmetric involvement of the small\\njoints of the hands, wrists, and knees and little or no\\njoint effusion. Although not considered diagnostic cri-\\nteria, the persistent fever, sweats, and malaise in this\\npatient are probably manifestations of systemic lupus\\nerythematosus, particularly since microbiologic cul-\\ntures were repeatedly negative. Laryngitis, 21 conjunc-\\ntivitis, 22 retinal cotton-wool spots, 23 and patchy pul-\\nmonary opacities 24 all features of this patient's\\nillness- have also been described in association with\\nlupus. Anemia with a positive Coombs' test and lym-\\nphopenia are hematologic diagnostic criteria. How-\\never, the findings in this case are not sufficient to es-\\ntablish the presence of lupus. Confirmation of the\\ndiagnosis requires testing for various antibodies that\\nare usually associated with the disease, such as antinu-\\nclear antibodies or antibodies against double-stranded\\nDNA or antibodies against the Sm antigen, which are\\nhighly specific for the diagnosis, as well as antibodies\\nagainst the Ro and La antigens.25\\nTABLE 6.

Although the pres-\\nence of inflammatory cells in synovial fluid is nonspe-\\ncific, the finding of two unusual types of cells deserves\\ncomment. The nonhematic cells, which may be syn-\\novial lining cells, are probably not relevant to the di-\\nagnosis.

ALEXANDER KRATZ: The diagnostic proce-\\ndure was serologic testing for antinuclear antibodies.\\nIn an indirect immunofluorescence assay with Hep-2\\ncells serving as the substrate, serum from the patient\\nshowed homogeneous staining of the entire nucleus\\nin interphase (Fig. 2), up to a dilution of 1:5120. This\\npattern of staining, which is caused by antibodies\\nagainst DNA, histone proteins, or the DNA-histone\\ncomplex, can be seen in a variety of connective-tissue\\ndiseases but is most often associated with systemic\\nlupus erythematosus.\\nAdditional testing for antibodies against double-\\nstranded DNA and for antibodies against the Sm, Ro,\\nLa, and RNP antigens was requested by the patient's\\nphysicians. The test for antibodies against double-\\nstranded DNA, performed as an indirect immunofluo-\\nrescence assay with the hemoflagellate Crithidia lu-\\nciliae as the substrate, was positive at a dilution of 1:40\\n(Fig. 3). Tests for the other antibodies, performed as\\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), were\\nnegative (Table 7).\\nThe positive test for antinuclear antibodies has to\\nbe interpreted in the context of the patient's age, his\\nuse of drugs known to induce these antibodies, the\\nhigh titer, and most important, the clinical picture. 33\\nPositive test results at low titers are common in per-\\nsons over the age of 60 years who do not have evi-\\ndence of connective-tissue disease. Since this patient\\nwas only 50 years old and had a high titer of antinu-\\nclear antibodies as well as a positive test for antibodies\\nagainst double-stranded DNA, age can be ruled out as\\nthe explanation for his positive antinuclear-antibody\\ntest. On admission, the patient was taking only ibupro-\\nfen and penicillin V. Although ibuprofen is known to\\nexacerbate the symptoms of idiopathic lupus, only a\\nsingle case of lupus-like syndrome due to ibuprofen\\nhypersensitivity has been reported.34 The possibility\\nthat penicillin induces lupus has been raised,35 but this\\npatient's symptoms antedated his penicillin therapy,\\nand antibodies against double-stranded DNA are usu-\\nally not detected in cases of drug-related lupus.\\nFigure 3.

ROBERT E. SCULLY: Dr. Costenbader, do you\\nhave follow-up information?\\nDR. KAREN COSTENBADER: We also diagnosed sys-\\ntemic lupus erythematosus. We administered predni-\\nsone (40 mg given orally once a day), as well as hy-\\ndroxychloroquine (200 mg given orally twice a day).\\nBy the next day, the patient was afebrile, and he was\\ndischarged home two days later. The dose of predni-\\nsone was subsequently tapered to 5 mg a day. He has\\ncontinued to take hydroxychloroquine, and a nonste-\\nroidal antiinflammatory drug was added for an episode\\nof bilateral scleritis. His arthritis and systemic symp-\\ntoms have disappeared, and the only problem has been\\nweight gain due to the prednisone.\\nDR. KURT J. BLOCH: The blood test for LE cells\\nis used infrequently. For the test to be positive, the in-\\ngested LE body (i.e., a transformed nucleus) must ap-\\npear completely homogeneous. LE cells are rarely de-\\ntected in circulating blood in patients with lupus, but\\nthey may be seen on smears of pericardial, pleural,\\nperitoneal, joint, and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as in\\nblister fluid, from patients with the disease, providing\\nstrong support for the diagnosis of lupus.38\\nAntibodies against Sm antigen are detected by pre-\\ncipitin tests with rabbit-thymus extracts used as anti-\\ngen and are considered markers for systemic lupus\\nerythematosus. Although investigators have claimed\\nthat even with sensitive ELISAs there is no loss of\\nspecificity,39 our experience suggests that some pa-\\ntients with antibodies against Sm antigen detected by\\nELISA do not have lupus.\\nWe routinely retest all ELISA-positive serum by gel\\ndiffusion; if the test remains positive, we assume that\\nthe patient has systemic lupus erythematosus. How-\\never, not all antibodies against Sm precipitate in gel\\nwith their corresponding antigens. Hence, a patient\\nwith a positive ELISA for antibodies against Sm but\\na negative gel-diffusion test may still have systemic\\nlupus erythematosus.\\n1934\\nN Engl J Med, Vol. 344, No. 25 June 21, 2001\\nwww.nejm.org\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

A tuberculin skin test was positive, with 20 mm of induration. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax performed elsewhere was said to show evidence of distal bronchiectasis and mucoid impaction. Sputum examination revealed no acid-fast bacilli. The following month, bronchoscopic examination showed no abnormalities, and culture of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid yielded a single colony of Aspergillus niger and was negative for acid-fast bacilli. Isoniazid and rifampin were administered for six months, in addition to pyrazinamide during the first two months. During most of this six-month period, there were no episodes of hemoptysis, but the chest pain became worse.\\nTwo months before admission, a CT scan of the thorax, performed without the intravenous injection of contrast material, showed a well-circumscribed nodule, 1.5 cm in diameter, in the left upper lobe with small nodular clusters in the left apex; an ill-defined nodule, 0.8 cm in diameter, in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe; and a nodule, 2.8 by 1.5 cm, surrounded by smaller nodules in the right lower lobe. There was slight bronchial-wall thickening in the left upper lobe but no evidence of bronchiectasis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination revealed no abnormalities; culture of a bronchoalveolar-lavage specimen yielded no acid-fast bacilli, fungi, or other pathogens. Pulmonary-function studies were performed (Table 1). During the six weeks before admission, the patient had slight dyspnea, with a nonproductive cough and malaise.\\nFour weeks before admission, thoracic CT scanning (Fig. 1 and 2), performed after the oral and intravenous administration of contrast material, showed that the large nodule in the left upper lobe had increased from 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter, the cluster of nodules in the left apex had increased in size, and the nodule in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe had increased from 0.8 to 1.5 cm. All the nodules were of soft-tissue density and were not enhanced after the administration of contrast material. Ten days before admission, the patient coughed up small amounts of blood. On the morning of admission, she had \"tightness\" of the chest and coughed up 120 ml of blood. She came to this hospital.\\nThe patient was a native of India who had immigrated to this country 17 years before admission. She did not smoke. There was no history of exposure to tuberculosis or to asbestos or other industrial dusts. She was taking no medications. There was a history of asthma. Five and a half years before admission, a polypoid mass within the right ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses had been excised. Pathological examination at that time disclosed chronic polypoid sinusitis with eosinophilia and ill-defined, non-necrotizing granulomas; septate fungal hyphae were identified, but no branching was observed. Fungal and mycobacterial cultures were negative. Clindamycin and corticosteroids were prescribed. Twenty-one months before admission, another operation had been performed because of nasal blockage by polyps, purulent discharge, and local pain; examination of the excised tissue disclosed septate fungi associated with eosinophils and inspissated mucin characteristic of allergic fungal sinusitis. A fungal smear showed a few mycotic organisms. A culture yielded abundant alpha-hemolytic streptococci; fungal and mycobacterial cultures were negative. Clarithromycin and local corticosteroid medication were given. Three months later, nasal endoscopic examination showed no abnormalities.\\nThe temperature was 36.6°C, the pulse was 60, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg. The oxygen saturation was 98 percent while the patient was breathing ambient air.\\nPhysical examination showed no abnormalities. The results of hematologic laboratory tests are shown in Table 2. Examination with a flexible bronchoscope showed no endobronchial lesions or active bleeding. There was erythema of the left-upper-lobe bronchus. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on the right upper, right middle, and left upper lobes. Cytologic examination of the specimen showed no fungi, acid-fast bacilli, or other microorganisms. Abundant macrophages were present, and no malignant cells were seen. Fungal cultures were negative. Bacteriologic cultures yielded normal respiratory tract flora; the results of mycobacterial cultures were not yet available. The temperature was normal on most occasions.\\nOn the second hospital day, the patient coughed up 5 to 10 ml of blood. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen obtained by needle aspiration disclosed purulent and necrotic debris; no acid-fast organisms were detected.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. JOHN F. BEAMIS*: May we review the radiographs?\\nDR. JANE P. Ko (Thoracic Radiology): The CT scans obtained eight months before admission were unavailable for review. The CT scans obtained four weeks before admission (Fig. 1 and 2) show that the bilateral upper-lobe nodules and the cluster of branching nodular opacities in the left apex are slightly larger than they had been on the images obtained two months before admission.\\nDR. BEAMIS: The differential diagnosis of pulmonary nodular lesions is extensive. In this case, there is no evidence to support the diagnosis of most of the disorders that result in the production of such nodules. Tuberculosis was a concern of the patient\\'s physicians, but on repeated examinations no tubercular bacilli were detected, and a prolonged trial of standard antituberculosis therapy was ineffective.\\nSinopulmonary Syndromes\\nThis patient\\'s history of sinus disease (diagnosed pathologically as allergic fungal sinusitis), the presence of bronchial-wall thickening, the reported evidence of bronchiectasis on the CT scan obtained eight months earlier, and the subsequent radiologic evidence suggesting that the pulmonary nodules have a branching pattern and thus are related to the airways indicate that the pulmonary lesions may be associated with the sinus disease. A classification of sinopulmonary syndromes is presented in Table 3.\\nA number of these disorders, including the immotile cilia syndrome, common variable immunodeficiency, IgA deficiency, IgG subclass deficiency, and Young\\'s syndrome, reflect defects in the defense mechanisms of the respiratory tract, and all of these disorders are associated with evidence of a more diffuse bronchiectasis than was seen in this case. Cystic fibrosis is associated with sinusitis and with radiographic abnormalities that are concentrated in the upper lobes of the lungs. Nodular densities of the size seen in this case are not usually present, unless there is a background of diffuse bronchiectasis or a complication such as mucoid impaction or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. A sweat test should be considered in any patient with unexplained sinobronchial symptoms, however, regardless of the patient\\'s age.\\nDiffuse panbronchiolitis is a rare form of progressive obstructive lung disease that may be seen in nonsmokers and that is usually associated with sinusitis. Almost all the cases have been reported from Japan. Recognition of this disease is important, since its progression may be slowed by macrolide therapy. Diffuse panbronchiolitis may produce pulmonary nodules, but they are usually more diffuse and smaller than those in the patient under discussion.1\\nThe absence of central-airway involvement rules out rhinoscleroma, which is endemic in parts of Asia, Central America, and central Europe.2 Various infections can result in pulmonary nodules in patients with disease due to infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, but this patient\\'s history does not suggest risk factors for that infection or evidence of immunodeficiency.\\nInvasive aspergillosis can involve the lungs and sinuses simultaneously. It usually occurs in immunocompromised persons. A. niger was cultured from this patient\\'s bronchoalveolar-lavage specimen seven months before admission. Chronic colonization with this organism can lead to invasive pulmonary disease or a mycetoma, both of which can result in hemoptysis. Because invasive aspergillosis often involves pulmonary vessels, pulmonary infarction and chest pain are common. Although this patient had chest pain, she was not acutely ill, as would be expected if invasive aspergillosis were present. A mycetoma can produce progressive nodular densities in the lung, but it is usually associated with cavitary lung disease. A typical crescent sign representing the fungus ball within a lung cavity was not seen on the radiographs in the current case.\\nWegener\\'s granulomatosis frequently involves the sinuses. Patients may present with a variety of lung lesions, including nodular densities, which are radiologically nonspecific and may cavitate. Chronic sinus disease, often with destructive changes in the sinus bones, is common. A diagnosis of Wegener\\'s granulomatosis would require confirmatory findings on open biopsy of a pulmonary lesion or other evidence of Wegener\\'s granulomatosis, such as renal disease and a positive test for antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies.4 In addition, it would be unlikely for Wegener\\'s granulomatosis to be present for five and a half years (the interval between excision of the polypoid mass in the sinus and admission) without producing more clinical manifestations than were present in this patient.\\nThe Churg-Strauss syndrome is characterized by hypereosinophilia and systemic necrotizing vasculitis that develop in association with asthma and allergic rhinitis. Although this patient may be at risk for the Churg-Strauss syndrome because of her history of asthma and may have CT findings compatible with that diagnosis, the diagnosis cannot be made without evidence of peripheral eosinophilia and manifestations of disease outside the respiratory system.\\nAllergic Fungal Sinusitis\\nAllergic fungal sinusitis, which this patient had, was first described by Katzenstein et al.,5 who reported seven cases in which the pathological findings in the paranasal sinuses were similar to those seen in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis associated with mucoid impaction of the bronchi. The typical patient with allergic fungal sinusitis has a history of asthma, nasal polyposis, and chronic sinusitis. The hallmark of this condition is slimy secretions of the airway that range from dark brown to green and contain numerous degenerating eosinophils, Charcot-Leyden crystals, denuded respiratory cells, and cellular debris on microscopical examination (i.e., allergic mucin).7 Fungal elements are often seen, and fungal cultures may be positive, but a specific fungus cannot always be identified. In one series, 1 of 67 patients had non-necrotizing granulomas similar to those described in this case. The granulomas were attributed to indolent fungal infection and were possibly the equivalent of the granulomas in bronchocentric granulomatosis, the typical pathological finding in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.\\nClinical criteria for the diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitis include the involvement of one or more paranasal sinuses, the identification of allergic mucin on biopsy, evidence of fungi in the nasal discharge or in surgically obtained specimens, the absence of diabetes or immunodeficiency, and the absence of invasive fungal disease.9-11 The disorder is characterized by periodic recurrences. The results of serologic testing, IgE levels, and eosinophil counts vary among patients and in an individual patient over time. Treatment involves surgical removal of the obstructing mucin, followed by oral corticosteroid therapy.12 Antifungal therapy has not been shown to be effective.\\nAllergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis\\nA number of cases in which allergic fungal sinusitis was accompanied by allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis have been reported,13-16 and I believe that this patient had both disorders. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis occurs throughout the world. Patients with airway disease, such as asthma or cystic fibrosis, are at increased risk for this disorder. Accepted criteria for the diagnosis include the presence of asthma, a positive immediate skin test for A. fumigatus, peripheral eosinophilia, an elevated total IgE level, fixed or transient pulmonary infiltrates, precipitating antibodies against aspergillus, and central bronchiectasis. Minor criteria include culture of A. fumigatus from the sputum, a history of expectoration of brown plugs,17 and the presence of specific IgE and IgG antibodies against aspergillus.18\\nThere are five stages of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Table 4).19 Patients\\' clinical presentation depends on the stage of the disease, and recognition of the stage is helpful in both diagnosis and care. The patient under discussion probably had stage 1 disease.\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis may have no radiologic manifestations, but usually several abnormalities are present. Central bronchiectasis, which is considered a specific finding, may be obvious, subtle, or absent. Other findings may include hyperinflation, varying infiltrates or areas of consolidation, nodules, and manifestations of bronchiectasis, including linear opacities, ring opacities, and gloved-finger opacities representing mucoid impaction. Neeld et al.20 emphasized the importance of CT scanning to detect bronchial-wall abnormalities, including thickening and cylindrical, varicose, and cystic bronchiectasis. More recently, Ward et al.4 described dilatation, bronchial-wall thickening, centrilobular nodules, mucoid impaction, atelectasis, and mosaic perfusion. The density of the nodular lesions can help to establish the diagnosis because of the high attenuation of mucoid plugs on CT scans.21 High attenuation is also characteristic of the mucoid impaction in the sinuses in allergic fungal sinusitis.\\nConclusions\\nIn summary, I believe that this patient had longstanding allergic fungal sinusitis followed by allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and that the enlarging upper-lobe nodular densities reflect progressive mucoid impaction of the airways. I also believe that the diagnosis could be made with serologic testing and a clinical trial of corticosteroid therapy rather than an open-lung biopsy. I would order a total eosinophil count and an assessment of the IgE level and, if possible, the levels of specific IgE and IgG antibodies to aspergillus. Treatment with corticosteroids according to established protocols should result in clearing of the nodular densities but might leave scarring and evidence of central bronchiectasis in these areas.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\n? Tuberculosis.\\n? Other bacterial or fungal infections.\\nDR. JOHN F. BEAMIS\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and allergic fungal sinusitis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: The patient\\'s physicians had a very wide differential diagnosis that included tuberculosis, other infections, collagen vascular diseases, and tumors. They selected lung biopsy as the potentially most informative diagnostic procedure, and a thoracoscopic biopsy of the left upper lobe was performed. The surgeon removed three nodules in a wedge-biopsy specimen, 2 cm in its greatest width (Fig. 3). The largest of the nodules, which were separated by normal lung tissue, was 1.2 cm in diameter. Microscopical examination of the nodules showed organizing pneumonia, within which bronchiolitis obliterans was present (Fig. 4); branching tufts of myxoid fibrous tissue filled the respiratory bronchioles. Organizing inflammation in adjacent alveoli appeared more recent, with less collagen deposition than that in the nodules. The findings were characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia. A proliferation of capillaries in the centers of the bronchioles (Fig. 4) may have been complicated by rupture, resulting in the patient\\'s bouts of hemoptysis. 22,23 There was also marked sclerosis of the small blood vessels, with intimal fibrosis and stenosis (Fig. 5).\\nWithin the fibrous tissue in the bronchiolar lumina (Fig. 6) and adjacent alveoli (Fig. 7), numerous eosinophils were present, warranting a diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. The clinical, radiographic, and pathological features of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia often overlap.24-26 In one series, bronchiolitis obliterans was found in 26 percent of cases of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.27 In addition, the two conditions share causative factors and clinical features, including hypersensitivity to aspergillus and drugs, aspiration, collagen vascular disease, and asthma with mucoid plugging.\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is not a well-defined clinicopathological entity. The histologic findings in cases in which this clinical diagnosis has been made have included one or more of the following: chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, purulent bronchiolitis, chronic bronchiolitis, granulomatous bronchiolitis, mucinous exudate in the bronchioles, mucoid impaction with eosinophils, and bronchocentric granulomatosis, 17,28-30 as well as bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia and eosinophilic pneumonia. Although we found some mucus in the alveoli, we did not find the characteristic mucoid impaction or bronchocentric granulomatosis, but they could have been present in proximal bronchioles and bronchi not sampled in the biopsy specimen. Also, we did not find fungi on special staining, but culture of one of the nodules yielded A. fumigatus. In a patient such as this one, who had a history of allergic fungal sinusitis, the pathological diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia overlapping chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is a morphologic representation of the clinical diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.\\nDR. BEAMIS: Did the patient have peripheral eosinophilia or an elevated IgE level?\\nDR. MARK: She did not have peripheral eosinophilia. We do not have the result of an IgE measurement. May we have the follow-up information, Dr. Basgoz?\\nDR. NESLI O. BASGOZ (Infectious Diseases): The patient received prednisone (20 mg a day) for two and a half months as well as itraconazole for aspergillus infection. However, severe edema, a rare reaction to the drug, developed and could not be reversed, despite marked lowering of the dose. Although she had no more episodes of hemoptysis, she continued to have a cough, back pain, and fatigue. We suspect that she has invasive aspergillosis in areas of the lung that were not sampled. We planned to substitute amphotericin B for the itraconazole, but unfortunately, she moved away from this area and discontinued contact with us.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "{'query': 'A 46-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of recurrent hemoptysis.\\nEight months earlier, a cough, nonpleuritic left-sided chest pain, and fatigue had developed, with minor episodes of hemoptysis. A tuberculin skin test was positive, with 20 mm of induration. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax performed elsewhere was said to show evidence of distal bronchiectasis and mucoid impaction. Sputum examination revealed no acid-fast bacilli. The following month, bronchoscopic examination showed no abnormalities, and culture of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid yielded a single colony of Aspergillus niger and was negative for acid-fast bacilli. Isoniazid and rifampin were administered for six months, in addition to pyrazinamide during the first two months. During most of this six-month period, there were no episodes of hemoptysis, but the chest pain became worse.\\nTwo months before admission, a CT scan of the thorax, performed without the intravenous injection of contrast material, showed a well-circumscribed nodule, 1.5 cm in diameter, in the left upper lobe with small nodular clusters in the left apex; an ill-defined nodule, 0.8 cm in diameter, in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe; and a nodule, 2.8 by 1.5 cm, surrounded by smaller nodules in the right lower lobe. There was slight bronchial-wall thickening in the left upper lobe but no evidence of bronchiectasis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination revealed no abnormalities; culture of a bronchoalveolar-lavage specimen yielded no acid-fast bacilli, fungi, or other pathogens. Pulmonary-function studies were performed (Table 1). During the six weeks before admission, the patient had slight dyspnea, with a nonproductive cough and malaise.\\nFour weeks before admission, thoracic CT scanning (Fig. 1 and 2), performed after the oral and intravenous administration of contrast material, showed that the large nodule in the left upper lobe had increased from 1.5 to 2 cm in diameter, the cluster of nodules in the left apex had increased in size, and the nodule in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe had increased from 0.8 to 1.5 cm. All the nodules were of soft-tissue density and were not enhanced after the administration of contrast material. Ten days before admission, the patient coughed up small amounts of blood. On the morning of admission, she had \"tightness\" of the chest and coughed up 120 ml of blood. She came to this hospital.\\nThe patient was a native of India who had immigrated to this country 17 years before admission. She did not smoke. There was no history of exposure to tuberculosis or to asbestos or other industrial dusts. She was taking no medications. There was a history of asthma. Five and a half years before admission, a polypoid mass within the right ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses had been excised. Pathological examination at that time disclosed chronic polypoid sinusitis with eosinophilia and ill-defined, non-necrotizing granulomas; septate fungal hyphae were identified, but no branching was observed. Fungal and mycobacterial cultures were negative. Clindamycin and corticosteroids were prescribed. Twenty-one months before admission, another operation had been performed because of nasal blockage by polyps, purulent discharge, and local pain; examination of the excised tissue disclosed septate fungi associated with eosinophils and inspissated mucin characteristic of allergic fungal sinusitis. A fungal smear showed a few mycotic organisms. A culture yielded abundant alpha-hemolytic streptococci; fungal and mycobacterial cultures were negative. Clarithromycin and local corticosteroid medication were given. Three months later, nasal endoscopic examination showed no abnormalities.\\nThe temperature was 36.6°C, the pulse was 60, and the respirations were 20. The blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg. The oxygen saturation was 98 percent while the patient was breathing ambient air.\\nPhysical examination showed no abnormalities. The results of hematologic laboratory tests are shown in Table 2. Examination with a flexible bronchoscope showed no endobronchial lesions or active bleeding. There was erythema of the left-upper-lobe bronchus. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on the right upper, right middle, and left upper lobes. Cytologic examination of the specimen showed no fungi, acid-fast bacilli, or other microorganisms. Abundant macrophages were present, and no malignant cells were seen. Fungal cultures were negative. Bacteriologic cultures yielded normal respiratory tract flora; the results of mycobacterial cultures were not yet available. The temperature was normal on most occasions.\\nOn the second hospital day, the patient coughed up 5 to 10 ml of blood. Pathological examination of a biopsy specimen obtained by needle aspiration disclosed purulent and necrotic debris; no acid-fast organisms were detected.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. JOHN F. BEAMIS*: May we review the radiographs?\\nDR. JANE P. Ko (Thoracic Radiology): The CT scans obtained eight months before admission were unavailable for review. The CT scans obtained four weeks before admission (Fig. 1 and 2) show that the bilateral upper-lobe nodules and the cluster of branching nodular opacities in the left apex are slightly larger than they had been on the images obtained two months before admission.\\nDR. BEAMIS: The differential diagnosis of pulmonary nodular lesions is extensive. In this case, there is no evidence to support the diagnosis of most of the disorders that result in the production of such nodules. Tuberculosis was a concern of the patient\\'s physicians, but on repeated examinations no tubercular bacilli were detected, and a prolonged trial of standard antituberculosis therapy was ineffective.\\nSinopulmonary Syndromes\\nThis patient\\'s history of sinus disease (diagnosed pathologically as allergic fungal sinusitis), the presence of bronchial-wall thickening, the reported evidence of bronchiectasis on the CT scan obtained eight months earlier, and the subsequent radiologic evidence suggesting that the pulmonary nodules have a branching pattern and thus are related to the airways indicate that the pulmonary lesions may be associated with the sinus disease. A classification of sinopulmonary syndromes is presented in Table 3.\\nA number of these disorders, including the immotile cilia syndrome, common variable immunodeficiency, IgA deficiency, IgG subclass deficiency, and Young\\'s syndrome, reflect defects in the defense mechanisms of the respiratory tract, and all of these disorders are associated with evidence of a more diffuse bronchiectasis than was seen in this case. Cystic fibrosis is associated with sinusitis and with radiographic abnormalities that are concentrated in the upper lobes of the lungs. Nodular densities of the size seen in this case are not usually present, unless there is a background of diffuse bronchiectasis or a complication such as mucoid impaction or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. A sweat test should be considered in any patient with unexplained sinobronchial symptoms, however, regardless of the patient\\'s age.\\nDiffuse panbronchiolitis is a rare form of progressive obstructive lung disease that may be seen in nonsmokers and that is usually associated with sinusitis. Almost all the cases have been reported from Japan. Recognition of this disease is important, since its progression may be slowed by macrolide therapy. Diffuse panbronchiolitis may produce pulmonary nodules, but they are usually more diffuse and smaller than those in the patient under discussion.1\\nThe absence of central-airway involvement rules out rhinoscleroma, which is endemic in parts of Asia, Central America, and central Europe.2 Various infections can result in pulmonary nodules in patients with disease due to infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, but this patient\\'s history does not suggest risk factors for that infection or evidence of immunodeficiency.\\nInvasive aspergillosis can involve the lungs and sinuses simultaneously. It usually occurs in immunocompromised persons. A. niger was cultured from this patient\\'s bronchoalveolar-lavage specimen seven months before admission. Chronic colonization with this organism can lead to invasive pulmonary disease or a mycetoma, both of which can result in hemoptysis. Because invasive aspergillosis often involves pulmonary vessels, pulmonary infarction and chest pain are common. Although this patient had chest pain, she was not acutely ill, as would be expected if invasive aspergillosis were present. A mycetoma can produce progressive nodular densities in the lung, but it is usually associated with cavitary lung disease. A typical crescent sign representing the fungus ball within a lung cavity was not seen on the radiographs in the current case.\\nWegener\\'s granulomatosis frequently involves the sinuses. Patients may present with a variety of lung lesions, including nodular densities, which are radiologically nonspecific and may cavitate. Chronic sinus disease, often with destructive changes in the sinus bones, is common. A diagnosis of Wegener\\'s granulomatosis would require confirmatory findings on open biopsy of a pulmonary lesion or other evidence of Wegener\\'s granulomatosis, such as renal disease and a positive test for antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies.4 In addition, it would be unlikely for Wegener\\'s granulomatosis to be present for five and a half years (the interval between excision of the polypoid mass in the sinus and admission) without producing more clinical manifestations than were present in this patient.\\nThe Churg-Strauss syndrome is characterized by hypereosinophilia and systemic necrotizing vasculitis that develop in association with asthma and allergic rhinitis. Although this patient may be at risk for the Churg-Strauss syndrome because of her history of asthma and may have CT findings compatible with that diagnosis, the diagnosis cannot be made without evidence of peripheral eosinophilia and manifestations of disease outside the respiratory system.\\nAllergic Fungal Sinusitis\\nAllergic fungal sinusitis, which this patient had, was first described by Katzenstein et al.,5 who reported seven cases in which the pathological findings in the paranasal sinuses were similar to those seen in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis associated with mucoid impaction of the bronchi. The typical patient with allergic fungal sinusitis has a history of asthma, nasal polyposis, and chronic sinusitis. The hallmark of this condition is slimy secretions of the airway that range from dark brown to green and contain numerous degenerating eosinophils, Charcot-Leyden crystals, denuded respiratory cells, and cellular debris on microscopical examination (i.e., allergic mucin).7 Fungal elements are often seen, and fungal cultures may be positive, but a specific fungus cannot always be identified. In one series, 1 of 67 patients had non-necrotizing granulomas similar to those described in this case. The granulomas were attributed to indolent fungal infection and were possibly the equivalent of the granulomas in bronchocentric granulomatosis, the typical pathological finding in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.\\nClinical criteria for the diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitis include the involvement of one or more paranasal sinuses, the identification of allergic mucin on biopsy, evidence of fungi in the nasal discharge or in surgically obtained specimens, the absence of diabetes or immunodeficiency, and the absence of invasive fungal disease.9-11 The disorder is characterized by periodic recurrences. The results of serologic testing, IgE levels, and eosinophil counts vary among patients and in an individual patient over time. Treatment involves surgical removal of the obstructing mucin, followed by oral corticosteroid therapy.12 Antifungal therapy has not been shown to be effective.\\nAllergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis\\nA number of cases in which allergic fungal sinusitis was accompanied by allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis have been reported,13-16 and I believe that this patient had both disorders. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis occurs throughout the world. Patients with airway disease, such as asthma or cystic fibrosis, are at increased risk for this disorder. Accepted criteria for the diagnosis include the presence of asthma, a positive immediate skin test for A. fumigatus, peripheral eosinophilia, an elevated total IgE level, fixed or transient pulmonary infiltrates, precipitating antibodies against aspergillus, and central bronchiectasis. Minor criteria include culture of A. fumigatus from the sputum, a history of expectoration of brown plugs,17 and the presence of specific IgE and IgG antibodies against aspergillus.18\\nThere are five stages of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Table 4).19 Patients\\' clinical presentation depends on the stage of the disease, and recognition of the stage is helpful in both diagnosis and care. The patient under discussion probably had stage 1 disease.\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis may have no radiologic manifestations, but usually several abnormalities are present. Central bronchiectasis, which is considered a specific finding, may be obvious, subtle, or absent. Other findings may include hyperinflation, varying infiltrates or areas of consolidation, nodules, and manifestations of bronchiectasis, including linear opacities, ring opacities, and gloved-finger opacities representing mucoid impaction. Neeld et al.20 emphasized the importance of CT scanning to detect bronchial-wall abnormalities, including thickening and cylindrical, varicose, and cystic bronchiectasis. More recently, Ward et al.4 described dilatation, bronchial-wall thickening, centrilobular nodules, mucoid impaction, atelectasis, and mosaic perfusion. The density of the nodular lesions can help to establish the diagnosis because of the high attenuation of mucoid plugs on CT scans.21 High attenuation is also characteristic of the mucoid impaction in the sinuses in allergic fungal sinusitis.\\nConclusions\\nIn summary, I believe that this patient had longstanding allergic fungal sinusitis followed by allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and that the enlarging upper-lobe nodular densities reflect progressive mucoid impaction of the airways. I also believe that the diagnosis could be made with serologic testing and a clinical trial of corticosteroid therapy rather than an open-lung biopsy. I would order a total eosinophil count and an assessment of the IgE level and, if possible, the levels of specific IgE and IgG antibodies to aspergillus. Treatment with corticosteroids according to established protocols should result in clearing of the nodular densities but might leave scarring and evidence of central bronchiectasis in these areas.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSES\\n? Tuberculosis.\\n? Other bacterial or fungal infections.\\nDR. JOHN F. BEAMIS\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and allergic fungal sinusitis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: The patient\\'s physicians had a very wide differential diagnosis that included tuberculosis, other infections, collagen vascular diseases, and tumors. They selected lung biopsy as the potentially most informative diagnostic procedure, and a thoracoscopic biopsy of the left upper lobe was performed. The surgeon removed three nodules in a wedge-biopsy specimen, 2 cm in its greatest width (Fig. 3). The largest of the nodules, which were separated by normal lung tissue, was 1.2 cm in diameter. Microscopical examination of the nodules showed organizing pneumonia, within which bronchiolitis obliterans was present (Fig. 4); branching tufts of myxoid fibrous tissue filled the respiratory bronchioles. Organizing inflammation in adjacent alveoli appeared more recent, with less collagen deposition than that in the nodules. The findings were characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia. A proliferation of capillaries in the centers of the bronchioles (Fig. 4) may have been complicated by rupture, resulting in the patient\\'s bouts of hemoptysis. 22,23 There was also marked sclerosis of the small blood vessels, with intimal fibrosis and stenosis (Fig. 5).\\nWithin the fibrous tissue in the bronchiolar lumina (Fig. 6) and adjacent alveoli (Fig. 7), numerous eosinophils were present, warranting a diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. The clinical, radiographic, and pathological features of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia often overlap.24-26 In one series, bronchiolitis obliterans was found in 26 percent of cases of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.27 In addition, the two conditions share causative factors and clinical features, including hypersensitivity to aspergillus and drugs, aspiration, collagen vascular disease, and asthma with mucoid plugging.\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is not a well-defined clinicopathological entity. The histologic findings in cases in which this clinical diagnosis has been made have included one or more of the following: chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, purulent bronchiolitis, chronic bronchiolitis, granulomatous bronchiolitis, mucinous exudate in the bronchioles, mucoid impaction with eosinophils, and bronchocentric granulomatosis, 17,28-30 as well as bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia and eosinophilic pneumonia. Although we found some mucus in the alveoli, we did not find the characteristic mucoid impaction or bronchocentric granulomatosis, but they could have been present in proximal bronchioles and bronchi not sampled in the biopsy specimen. Also, we did not find fungi on special staining, but culture of one of the nodules yielded A. fumigatus. In a patient such as this one, who had a history of allergic fungal sinusitis, the pathological diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia overlapping chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is a morphologic representation of the clinical diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.\\nDR. BEAMIS: Did the patient have peripheral eosinophilia or an elevated IgE level?\\nDR. MARK: She did not have peripheral eosinophilia. We do not have the result of an IgE measurement. May we have the follow-up information, Dr. Basgoz?\\nDR. NESLI O. BASGOZ (Infectious Diseases): The patient received prednisone (20 mg a day) for two and a half months as well as itraconazole for aspergillus infection. However, severe edema, a rare reaction to the drug, developed and could not be reversed, despite marked lowering of the dose. Although she had no more episodes of hemoptysis, she continued to have a cough, back pain, and fatigue. We suspect that she has invasive aspergillosis in areas of the lung that were not sampled. We planned to substitute amphotericin B for the itraconazole, but unfortunately, she moved away from this area and discontinued contact with us.', 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"Based on the patient's presentation, history, and investigations, the most likely diagnosis is **Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) with Allergic Fungal Sinusitis (AFS)**.\\n\\nHere's the reasoning:\\n\\n1.  **Information Gathering:**\\n    *   **Key Signs/Symptoms:** Recurrent hemoptysis, cough, chest pain, fatigue, dyspnea, malaise.\\n    *   **Duration:** Symptoms have been present for approximately 8 months.\\n    *   **Epidemiologic Context:** Native of India, immigrated 17 years ago.

Theincidence of undiagnosed cases is, by definition,not known,¹ but it has been suggested that itmay be as high as 1 case per 30,000.2 The poten-tial for exposure to prions through accidentalcontact with prion-infected tissues, as reportedin a case published in the Journal, is of concern,since prions are not inactivated by formalin fixa-tion. Because experiments in animals have shownthat abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) accumulatesin the central nervous system long before theonset of disease, the risk of iatrogenic transmis-sion from \"prion carriers\" to other persons ispossible.We have started using real-time quaking-induced conversion to screen for prion diseasein the cadavers received by our institution foranatomical practice.

Theincidence of undiagnosed cases is, by definition,not known,¹ but it has been suggested that itmay be as high as 1 case per 30,000.2 The poten-tial for exposure to prions through accidentalcontact with prion-infected tissues, as reportedin a case published in the Journal, is of concern,since prions are not inactivated by formalin fixa-tion. Because experiments in animals have shownthat abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) accumulatesin the central nervous system long before theonset of disease, the risk of iatrogenic transmis-sion from \"prion carriers\" to other persons ispossible.We have started using real-time quaking-induced conversion to screen for prion diseasein the cadavers received by our institution foranatomical practice.

This notification followed the detectionof Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in mummi-fied, stillborn, and weak newborn piglets frommultiple commercial piggeries across four temper-ate southern Australian states, with concomitantrecognition of human cases of Japanese enceph-alitis. As of August 1, 2022, a total of 40 casesof infection that had led to 5 deaths had beenreported.¹In 1995 and 1998, in the tropical far north ofAustralia in Queensland, 5 cases of Japaneseencephalitis (and 2 deaths) caused by genotype 2were identified. It was hypothesized that thisoutbreak resulted from the incursion of cyclonic-wind-transported JEV-infected mosquitoes fromPapua New Guinea.2 Since 1998, no further en-demic cases of Japanese encephalitis had beendetected in Australia until a case in February2021 that resulted in death. This case appearedto be a sentinel human case of the current out-break that was identified a year later at a loca-tion that was more than 3000 km to the south.In the sentinel case, a 45-year-old resident ofthe Tiwi Islands (located 80 km north of Darwinon the Northern Territory coast) presented witha 2-day history of acute confusion and fever. Thepatient was admitted to Royal Darwin Hospitalwith progressive neurologic deterioration. De-spite receiving mechanical ventilation in the in-tensive care unit, the patient died 15 days afteradmission. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) revealed 11 million erythrocytes and 88million lymphocytes per liter, a glucose level of5.5 mmol per liter, and a protein level of 1.05 gper liter (reference range, 0.15 to 0.45). Mag-netic resonance imaging showed changes withT2 hyperintensity in both thalami, in the rightcerebellar hemisphere, and in the brain stem(Fig. 1A). Results of polymerase-chain-reactionassay for flavivirus RNA were negative on initialanalysis of serum and CSF. Serum indirect fluo-rescent antibody testing was negative on admis-sion but positive on day 13 for JEV IgM and IgGand was equivocal for IgM for the closely relatedMurray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus, which isendemic in northern Australia.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging and HistologicAnalysis in the Sentinel Patient.Panel A shows bilateral symmetric thalamic T2 hyperin-tensity and restricted diffusion in a 45-year-old residentof the Tiwi Islands who was treated for progressive neu-rologic deterioration caused by Japanese encephalitisin February 2021.

Panel B shows the results ofpostmortem histologic analysis of a midbrain samplefrom the patient indicating dense lymphocytic perivas-cular cuffing.tologic analysis of the brain was consistent withviral panencephalitis (Fig. 1B). Most affected werethe thalami, brain stem, and upper cervical spinalcord, findings that were consistent with those seen in JEV, MVE, and West Nile virus (WNV)infection.³ Genotype 4 JEV has been recognized in Indo-nesia, including in Bali. Possibilities for thisintroduction into Australia include entry of JEV-infected mosquitoes, either wind-blown or har-boring on planes or vessels, or transmission tolocal mosquitoes from a JEV-infected migratorybird. Subsequent dissemination to southern Aus-tralia is likely to have been facilitated by JEV-infected water birds, followed by virus amplifi-cation in commercial, domestic, and feral pigs.Ongoing surveillance of commercial piggeriesand sampling of mosquitoes and feral pigs willdetermine the extent to which JEV persists overthe current winter and reemerges next summer,with implications for the planning of a possiblenational rollout of JEV vaccination. The identifi-cation of JEV in Australia has many analogies tothe introduction and dissemination of WNV inthe United States, and it is worrisome that JEVmay become endemic in Australia.Claire Waller, F.R.A.C.P.Marianne Tiemensma, F.R.C.P.A.Northern Territory Department of HealthDarwin, NT, AustraliaBart J.

(June 2 issue)¹ showed the superiority of high-dose budesonide–albuterol to albuterol as relievertherapy for reducing exacerbations in patients withuncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. Only27% of the patients were receiving high-doseinhaled glucocorticoid–long-acting B₂-agonist(LABA) therapy at baseline, and the presence ofa mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second(FEV₁) of 64% of the predicted value and a meanreversibility in FEV₁ of 28% indicates that therewas considerable room for improvement. Wouldbudesonide–albuterol therapy have been as effec-tive in patients whose inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA therapy had been sufficiently adapted dur-ing an initial run-in period, perhaps with the useof the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide level toguide suppression of type 2 inflammation?2Brian J.

      "{'query': 'CORRESPONDENCEJapanese Encephalitis in Australia - A Sentinel CaseTO THE EDITOR: On March 4, 2022, Japaneseencephalitis was identified as a \"communicabledisease incident of national significance\" inAustralia. This notification followed the detectionof Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in mummi-fied, stillborn, and weak newborn piglets frommultiple commercial piggeries across four temper-ate southern Australian states, with concomitantrecognition of human cases of Japanese enceph-alitis. As of August 1, 2022, a total of 40 casesof infection that had led to 5 deaths had beenreported.¹In 1995 and 1998, in the tropical far north ofAustralia in Queensland, 5 cases of Japaneseencephalitis (and 2 deaths) caused by genotype 2were identified. It was hypothesized that thisoutbreak resulted from the incursion of cyclonic-wind-transported JEV-infected mosquitoes fromPapua New Guinea.2 Since 1998, no further en-demic cases of Japanese encephalitis had beendetected in Australia until a case in February2021 that resulted in death. This case appearedto be a sentinel human case of the current out-break that was identified a year later at a loca-tion that was more than 3000 km to the south.In the sentinel case, a 45-year-old resident ofthe Tiwi Islands (located 80 km north of Darwinon the Northern Territory coast) presented witha 2-day history of acute confusion and fever. Thepatient was admitted to Royal Darwin Hospitalwith progressive neurologic deterioration. De-spite receiving mechanical ventilation in the in-tensive care unit, the patient died 15 days afteradmission. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) revealed 11 million erythrocytes and 88million lymphocytes per liter, a glucose level of5.5 mmol per liter, and a protein level of 1.05 gper liter (reference range, 0.15 to 0.45). Mag-netic resonance imaging showed changes withT2 hyperintensity in both thalami, in the rightcerebellar hemisphere, and in the brain stem(Fig. 1A). Results of polymerase-chain-reactionassay for flavivirus RNA were negative on initialanalysis of serum and CSF. Serum indirect fluo-rescent antibody testing was negative on admis-sion but positive on day 13 for JEV IgM and IgGand was equivocal for IgM for the closely relatedMurray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus, which isendemic in northern Australia.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging and HistologicAnalysis in the Sentinel Patient.Panel A shows bilateral symmetric thalamic T2 hyperin-tensity and restricted diffusion in a 45-year-old residentof the Tiwi Islands who was treated for progressive neu-rologic deterioration caused by Japanese encephalitisin February 2021.

Panel B shows the results ofpostmortem histologic analysis of a midbrain samplefrom the patient indicating dense lymphocytic perivas-cular cuffing.tologic analysis of the brain was consistent withviral panencephalitis (Fig. 1B). Most affected werethe thalami, brain stem, and upper cervical spinalcord, findings that were consistent with those seen in JEV, MVE, and West Nile virus (WNV)infection.³ Genotype 4 JEV has been recognized in Indo-nesia, including in Bali. Possibilities for thisintroduction into Australia include entry of JEV-infected mosquitoes, either wind-blown or har-boring on planes or vessels, or transmission tolocal mosquitoes from a JEV-infected migratorybird. Subsequent dissemination to southern Aus-tralia is likely to have been facilitated by JEV-infected water birds, followed by virus amplifi-cation in commercial, domestic, and feral pigs.Ongoing surveillance of commercial piggeriesand sampling of mosquitoes and feral pigs willdetermine the extent to which JEV persists overthe current winter and reemerges next summer,with implications for the planning of a possiblenational rollout of JEV vaccination. The identifi-cation of JEV in Australia has many analogies tothe introduction and dissemination of WNV inthe United States, and it is worrisome that JEVmay become endemic in Australia.Claire Waller, F.R.A.C.P.Marianne Tiemensma, F.R.C.P.A.Northern Territory Department of HealthDarwin, NT, AustraliaBart J.

(June 2 issue)¹ showed the superiority of high-dose budesonide–albuterol to albuterol as relievertherapy for reducing exacerbations in patients withuncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. Only27% of the patients were receiving high-doseinhaled glucocorticoid–long-acting B₂-agonist(LABA) therapy at baseline, and the presence ofa mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second(FEV₁) of 64% of the predicted value and a meanreversibility in FEV₁ of 28% indicates that therewas considerable room for improvement. Wouldbudesonide–albuterol therapy have been as effec-tive in patients whose inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA therapy had been sufficiently adapted dur-ing an initial run-in period, perhaps with the useof the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide level toguide suppression of type 2 inflammation?2Brian J.

Two years after the diagnosis of a European haplotype of E. multilocularis in a patient in Vermont (Patient VT1) who did not have a history of exposure to alveolar echinococcosis abroad,¹ the disease was diagnosed in a second patient in Vermont (Patient VT2), who also did not have such exposure history. Details regarding the two cases are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org. Patient VT2 was an 82-year-old man with memory decline who presented with painless jaundice. The laboratory evaluation revealed a total bilirubin level of 15.4 mg per deciliter (263 µmol per liter), an alkaline phosphatase level of 573 U per liter, an aspartate aminotransferase level of 156 U per liter, and an alanine aminotransferase level of 190 U per liter. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a mass-like hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver with intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and mass effect on the inferior vena cava. Biopsy of the mass revealed histologic features consistent with E. multilocularis. With the diagnosis of two alveolar echinococcosis cases in humans, we sought to investigate whether an animal reservoir could be genetically linked to the human isolates. We screened stool samples obtained from 434 wild canids (296 foxes and 138 coyotes) from Virginia for E. multilocularis DNA, and two red foxes (fox146 and fox197) tested positive. We then sequenced DNA obtained from Patient VT1, fox146, and fox197 for NAD2, COB, and COX1, since the presence of COX1 had previously been identified in the sample obtained from Patient VT1.¹ We had samples of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue obtained from Patient VT2, which permitted only directed amplification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in COB and COX1. Details regarding methods and GenBank accession numbers are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. Mitochondrial sequences of E. multilocularis in samples from Patient VT1, fox146, and fox197 showed close identity with the Slovakian E5 European haplotype (Fig. 1A). E. multilocularis DNA in the sample obtained from Patient VT2 was fragmented, but we determined that 27 of the 29 discriminatory COX1 and COB SNPs were identical to the E5 haplotype. Previous studies have suggested the involvement of U.S. domestic dogs in the transmission of E. multilocularis in Virginia³ and Missouri. In addition, published sequencing results have shown considerable SNP similarities to the E5 haplotype (Fig. 1B). Before the diagnosis in Patient VT1, reports of E. multilocularis in humans in the United States have been limited to North American haplotypes that have been detected only in Alaska and the North Central area of the country. European strains have been regarded as more virulent than the lower-risk North American haplotypes, as illustrated by findings after the emergence of a European-like strain in wildlife in western Canada in 2012. By 2016, the human incidence of this strain was mirroring the incidence in Europe.⁵ Our data suggest the presence of changing epidemiologic features of E. multilocularis in the United States and provide evidence of the possible establishment of a reservoir and active transmission of a European strain. The emergence of this more virulent strain necessitates a growing diagnostic awareness among physicians, particularly in patients with no history of travel outside the United States who present with liver masses.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

Recently, HPAI A(H5N1)clade 2.3.4.4b viruses were identified in dairycows, and in unpasteurized milk samples, inmultiple U.S. states.4,5 We report a case of HPAIA(H5N1) virus infection in a dairy farm workerin Texas.In late March 2024, an adult dairy farm workerhad onset of redness and discomfort in the righteye.

Auscultation revealed clear lungs.There was no history of fever or feverishness, re-spiratory symptoms, changes in vision, or othersymptoms. The worker reported no contact withsick or dead wild birds, poultry, or other animalsbut reported direct and close exposure to dairycows that appeared to be well and with sick cowsthat showed the same signs of illness as cows atother dairy farms in the same area of northernTexas with confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infec-tion (e.g., decreased milk production, reducedappetite, lethargy, fever, and dehydration). Theworker reported wearing gloves when workingwith cows but did not use any respiratory or eyeprotection.Conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab speci-mens were obtained from the right eye for in-fluenza testing. The results of real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR)testing were presumptive for influenza A andA(H5) virus in both specimens. On the basis ofa presumptive A(H5) result, home isolation wasrecommended, and oral oseltamivir (75 mg twicedaily for 5 days) was provided for treatment ofthe worker and for postexposure prophylaxisfor the worker's household contacts (at the samedose). The next day, the worker reported nosymptoms except discomfort in both eyes; re-evaluation revealed subconjunctival hemorrhagein both eyes, with no visual impairment (Fig. 1).Over the subsequent days, the worker report-ed resolution of conjunctivitis without respira-tory symptoms, and household contacts re-mained well.On the basis of real-time RT-PCR and sequenc-ing, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection in the conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab speci-N ENGLJ MED 390;21 NEJM.ORG JUNE 6, 2024The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Only with stenosisof approximately 80% was coronary flow shownto decrease in the resting state, a finding thathighlighted the role of coronary autoregulationin maintaining stable blood flow in the face ofepicardial stenosis. Conversely, during hyper-emia, coronary flow was highly sensitive to in-creasing epicardial resistance, which reflectedthe expended autoregulatory capacity of themicrocirculation during hyperemia, in whichmicrovascular resistance is already at a mini-mum level.Using continuous thermodilution to measureabsolute coronary flow, we investigated coro-nary autoregulation in the face of increasingepicardial resistance in a single human partici-pant. The patient provided written informedconsent for the experimental protocol.A 63-year-old man with refractory angina un-derwent stent implantation in the proximal leftanterior descending artery with a drug-elutingstent measuring 3 mm by 23 mm. The represen-tativeness of this patient with coronary arterydisease is described in Table S1 in the Supple-mentary Appendix, available with the full text ofthis letter at NEJM.org. A pressure-and-tempera-ture sensor wire (Abbott Vascular) that was con-nected to dedicated software (CoroFlow, Coro-ventis) was then placed in the distal leftanterior descending artery. A semicompliantballoon measuring 2.5 mm by 8 mm was ad-vanced over a regular wire and positionedwithin the stent.Continuous thermodilution² (RayFlow, Hexa-cath) was performed with the patient at restwhile the semi-compliant balloon was graduallyinflated over a 2-minute period (Fig. 1A andFig. S1). The protocol was then repeated duringhyperemia (Fig. 1B).Figure 1C shows the relationship between theresting distal coronary-to-aorta pressure ratio(or fractional flow reserve during hyperemia)and absolute coronary flow. Resting flow re-mained stable over the whole range of distalcoronary-to-aorta pressure ratios, with a meanvalue of 39.4 ml per minute. Hyperemic flowapproximated a linear relationship with thefractional flow reserve, decreasing from 176.8ml to 81.4 ml per minute.These findings show the autoregulatory ca-pacity of the coronary microcirculation with theFigure 1 (facing page). Coronary Pressure and Thermodilution-Derived Flow Tracings.Panel A shows the pressure and continuous thermodilution-derived flow tracings obtained with the patient at restwith a pressure-and-temperature sensor wire positioned in the distal left anterior descending artery and an infusioncatheter positioned in the first millimeters of the proximal left anterior descending artery, while a semicompliantballoon was inflated to nominal pressure within a stent in the proximal left anterior descending artery. Panel Bshows these data during hyperemia. Aortic pressure is shown in red, the distal coronary pressure is shown in green,the distal coronary-to-aorta pressure ratio and fractional flow reserve (FFR) are shown in yellow, and the tempera-ture of mixed blood and saline is shown in blue. The temperatures of the mixed blood-and-saline solution and thesaline infusion are relative to the blood temperature. Panel C shows the relationship between the pressure ratio andabsolute coronary flow with the patient at rest and during hyperemia.

Recently, HPAI A(H5N1)clade 2.3.4.4b viruses were identified in dairycows, and in unpasteurized milk samples, inmultiple U.S. states.4,5 We report a case of HPAIA(H5N1) virus infection in a dairy farm workerin Texas.In late March 2024, an adult dairy farm workerhad onset of redness and discomfort in the righteye. On presentation that day, subconjunctivalhemorrhage and thin, serous drainage were notedin the right eye.

Auscultation revealed clear lungs.There was no history of fever or feverishness, re-spiratory symptoms, changes in vision, or othersymptoms. The worker reported no contact withsick or dead wild birds, poultry, or other animalsbut reported direct and close exposure to dairycows that appeared to be well and with sick cowsthat showed the same signs of illness as cows atother dairy farms in the same area of northernTexas with confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infec-tion (e.g., decreased milk production, reducedappetite, lethargy, fever, and dehydration). Theworker reported wearing gloves when workingwith cows but did not use any respiratory or eyeprotection.Conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab speci-mens were obtained from the right eye for in-fluenza testing. The results of real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR)testing were presumptive for influenza A andA(H5) virus in both specimens. On the basis ofa presumptive A(H5) result, home isolation wasrecommended, and oral oseltamivir (75 mg twicedaily for 5 days) was provided for treatment ofthe worker and for postexposure prophylaxisfor the worker's household contacts (at the samedose). The next day, the worker reported nosymptoms except discomfort in both eyes; re-evaluation revealed subconjunctival hemorrhagein both eyes, with no visual impairment (Fig. 1).Over the subsequent days, the worker report-ed resolution of conjunctivitis without respira-tory symptoms, and household contacts re-mained well.On the basis of real-time RT-PCR and sequenc-ing, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection in the conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab speci-N ENGLJ MED 390;21 NEJM.ORG JUNE 6, 2024The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Only with stenosisof approximately 80% was coronary flow shownto decrease in the resting state, a finding thathighlighted the role of coronary autoregulationin maintaining stable blood flow in the face ofepicardial stenosis. Conversely, during hyper-emia, coronary flow was highly sensitive to in-creasing epicardial resistance, which reflectedthe expended autoregulatory capacity of themicrocirculation during hyperemia, in whichmicrovascular resistance is already at a mini-mum level.Using continuous thermodilution to measureabsolute coronary flow, we investigated coro-nary autoregulation in the face of increasingepicardial resistance in a single human partici-pant. The patient provided written informedconsent for the experimental protocol.A 63-year-old man with refractory angina un-derwent stent implantation in the proximal leftanterior descending artery with a drug-elutingstent measuring 3 mm by 23 mm. The represen-tativeness of this patient with coronary arterydisease is described in Table S1 in the Supple-mentary Appendix, available with the full text ofthis letter at NEJM.org. A pressure-and-tempera-ture sensor wire (Abbott Vascular) that was con-nected to dedicated software (CoroFlow, Coro-ventis) was then placed in the distal leftanterior descending artery. A semicompliantballoon measuring 2.5 mm by 8 mm was ad-vanced over a regular wire and positionedwithin the stent.Continuous thermodilution² (RayFlow, Hexa-cath) was performed with the patient at restwhile the semi-compliant balloon was graduallyinflated over a 2-minute period (Fig. 1A andFig. S1). The protocol was then repeated duringhyperemia (Fig. 1B).Figure 1C shows the relationship between theresting distal coronary-to-aorta pressure ratio(or fractional flow reserve during hyperemia)and absolute coronary flow. Resting flow re-mained stable over the whole range of distalcoronary-to-aorta pressure ratios, with a meanvalue of 39.4 ml per minute. Hyperemic flowapproximated a linear relationship with thefractional flow reserve, decreasing from 176.8ml to 81.4 ml per minute.These findings show the autoregulatory ca-pacity of the coronary microcirculation with theFigure 1 (facing page). Coronary Pressure and Thermodilution-Derived Flow Tracings.Panel A shows the pressure and continuous thermodilution-derived flow tracings obtained with the patient at restwith a pressure-and-temperature sensor wire positioned in the distal left anterior descending artery and an infusioncatheter positioned in the first millimeters of the proximal left anterior descending artery, while a semicompliantballoon was inflated to nominal pressure within a stent in the proximal left anterior descending artery. Panel Bshows these data during hyperemia. Aortic pressure is shown in red, the distal coronary pressure is shown in green,the distal coronary-to-aorta pressure ratio and fractional flow reserve (FFR) are shown in yellow, and the tempera-ture of mixed blood and saline is shown in blue. The temperatures of the mixed blood-and-saline solution and thesaline infusion are relative to the blood temperature. Panel C shows the relationship between the pressure ratio andabsolute coronary flow with the patient at rest and during hyperemia.

      "*   **Symptoms:** Febrile illness, recent tick bites.\n",
      "*   **Lab Findings:** XCV detected in serum, increased IgG antibody titers in paired serum samples, leukopenia, elevated liver enzymes, lactic dehydrogenase, a-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, amyloid protein A, and C-reactive protein.\n",
      "*   **Tick Exposure:** XCV detected in Haemaphysalis concinna and H. japonica ticks.\n",
      "*   **Epidemiology:** Northeastern China, tick bites.\n",
      "*   **Red Flags:** Severe disease requiring hospitalization, elevated liver enzymes, lactic dehydrogenase, a-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, amyloid protein A, and C-reactive protein.\n",

      "2) Hypothesis Generation:\n",
      "*   **Systemic:** Given the systemic symptoms (leukopenia, elevated liver enzymes, etc.) and the presence of XCV in ticks, a tick-borne viral infection is highly likely.\n",
      "*   **Timing/Progression:** The acute febrile illness suggests an acute infection. The increased antibody titers indicate a possible past exposure or a more prolonged infection.\n",
      "*   **Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "    *   **Tick-borne viruses:** Considering the XCV detection in ticks and the clinical presentation, tick-borne viruses are the most likely cause.\n",
      "    *   **Other tick-borne diseases:** Consider other tick-borne diseases that could present with similar symptoms, such as Rickettsial infections (e.g., Rickettsia raoultii), Borrelia infections (e.g., Lyme disease), and other viral infections.\n",
      "    *   **Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers:** Although less likely given the specific lab findings, consider viral hemorrhagic fevers (e.g., Dengue, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever) if there are signs of bleeding or severe organ dysfunction.\n",

Be concise and grounded.\\n\\n# PATIENT CASE\\nA 57-year-old man was admitted to the hospital, for the sixth time, in January because of fever and cough.\\nThe patient had a 25-year history of seronegative rheumatoid arthritis and a 20-year history of diabetes mellitus type 2, complicated by retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy. One year before the first admission (34 months before the current admission) bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia was diagnosed on the basis of a biopsy (Fig. 1). Treatment with prednisone in small doses improved the patient's dyspnea.\\nWhile the prednisone dose was being tapered, symptoms consistent with recurrent bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, accompanied by skeletal-muscle weakness, esophageal dysmotility, and gastroparesis, led to the patient's first admission (22 months before the current admission). Polymyositis, which was positive for anti-Jo-1 antibody, was diagnosed. Treatment with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide relieved the dyspnea, and the patient was discharged on the 15th hospital day with instructions to take cyclophosphamide (125 mg daily), prednisone (60 mg daily), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (one double-strength tablet daily), and insulin.\\nNine months after discharge (13 months before the current admission), the patient spent 2 months in an intensive care unit because of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome; a thoracoscopic biopsy showed changes consistent with the presence of organizing, diffuse alveolar damage (Fig. 2, 3, 4, and 5). A test for human immunodeficiency virus antibody was negative. Coagulase-negative staphylococcal and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia developed, and a mitral-valve vegetation was detected on a transesophageal cardiac ultrasonographic study. The patient was discharged with instructions to take cyclophosphamide (75 mg daily), cyclosporine (175 mg twice a day), prednisone (10 mg daily), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\\nSix months before the current admission, the patient was hospitalized because of fever and possible aspiration pneumonia. Bronchoscopic examination showed evidence of aspiration in the larynx at the level of the vocal cords. A sputum culture yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae. Antibiotic therapy relieved the fever. The dose of cyclophosphamide was tapered, and the patient was discharged on the ninth hospital day while receiving cyclosporine (125 mg twice a day), prednisone (15 mg daily, subsequently increased to 50 mg daily), and a course of levofloxacin.\\nSixteen weeks before the current admission, the patient was hospitalized because of recurrent P. carinii pneumonia, for which pentamidine was administered intravenously. He was discharged on the 23rd hospital day while taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cyclosporine (100 mg twice a day), and prednisone (20 mg daily for 2 weeks, then 15 mg daily). Ten days later, the patient received an injection of influenza vaccine.\\nFive and a half weeks before the current admission, the patient was hospitalized because of a temperature of 38.3°C, without chills, cough, or dyspnea. The lungs were normal on physical and radiographic examinations. A blood culture yielded very fastidious viridans streptococci, which was sensitive to ceftriaxone. The patient was discharged on the sixth hospital day with instructions to continue taking ceftriaxone (2 g daily, administered intravenously). The dose of prednisone was tapered (from 15 to 5 mg daily), and the dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was reduced from one double-strength tablet daily to one tablet three times a week; the dose of cyclosporine was increased from 125 mg daily to 100 mg twice a day.\\nThe results of pulmonary-function studies performed one week before the current admission (Table 1) were consistent with the presence of a restrictive process as well as an obstructive process. One day before admission, malaise developed abruptly, with a nonproductive cough, a temperature that peaked at 38.9°C, a sore throat, and rhinorrhea. On the next day, the patient returned to the hospital.\\nThe patient had had no known exposure to sick persons or signs of worsening respiratory function. He had discontinued a 20-pack-year history of cigarette smoking 25 years earlier.\\nThe temperature was 38.0°C, the pulse was 97, and the respirations were 24. The blood pressure was 120/75 mm Hg. The arterial oxygen saturation was 98 percent while the patient was breathing ambient air. On examination, he coughed frequently and had dyspnea at rest. There were coarse breath sounds without dullness, wheezes, or crackles, as well as mild digital clubbing.\\nThe urine was positive (+++) for glucose and trace-positive for ketones. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 2 and 3). A chest radiograph showed patchy and linear opacities in both lower lobes, with peribronchial thickening (Fig. 6).\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. RAPHAEL DOLIN*: May we see the radiographs?\\nDR. JO-ANNE O. SHEPARD (Cardiothoracic Radiology): A posteroanterior chest radiograph (Fig. 6) shows faint patchy and linear opacities at the lung bases, especially on the left side, with peribronchial thickening. There is no evidence of honeycomb changes.\\nDR. DOLIN: To explain the acute respiratory tract illness that precipitated the current admission, I shall consider three broad categories of disease: an exacerbation of a chronic pulmonary process, an opportunistic infection after immunosuppressive treatment, and respiratory tract infection with a community-acquired pathogen.\\n\\nExacerbation of a Chronic Pulmonary Process\\nChronic pulmonary processes have been associated with connective-tissue disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and polymyositis, both of which this patient had. The pulmonary lesions in rheumatoid arthritis, which are more common in seropositive cases than in seronegative cases, include pleuritis, pneumonitis, interstitial fibrosis, pleuropulmonary nodules, and arteritis.¹ Interstitial lung disease occurs in 5 to 10 percent of patients with polymyositis or dermatomyositis, especially in those with anti-Jo-1 antibody.² Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, which this patient also had, can be caused by infections, toxins, and inflammatory processes and has been associated with both rheumatoid arthritis and polymyositis.³ Pulmonary disease in patients with connective-tissue disorders tends to wax and wane with the activity of the underlying disease and treatment regimens. The results of this patient's pulmonary-function tests are consistent with the presence of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, or both, although the chest radiograph shows remarkably few abnormalities. An acute exacerbation of any of these chronic processes, however, would be very unlikely to explain the severe acute, systemic illness in this patient.\\n\\nOpportunistic Infection after Immunosuppressive Treatment\\nThe patient was receiving potent immunosuppressive therapy for 22 months before the current admission and had had two episodes of P. carinii pneumonia, a condition that is most common in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome but that also complicates both immunosuppressive and cytotoxic therapy.⁴⁻⁶ Assuming that he had adhered to the prophylactic regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which is highly effective, the acute illness that precipitated the current admission was probably not a third episode of P. carinii pneumonia. Also, the abrupt onset of his illness, particularly with the early prominence of systemic symptoms, is not characteristic of P. carinii pneumonia. Finally, although the radiographic findings associated with P. carinii pneumonia vary greatly and include patchy and linear pulmonary opacities, particularly in patients with previous pulmonary injury, the characteristic radiographic manifestation of this disease is the presence of diffuse interstitial infiltrates.\\nNeither the immunosuppression in this case nor the abrupt onset of the illness with upper respiratory tract involvement is characteristic of pneumonia due to cytomegalovirus, an important opportunistic pathogen that can cause disease by itself or in combination with other pathogens such as P. carinii.⁷,⁸ With respect to other opportunistic infections, the case record contains no information about environmental exposure, a history of travel, or microbiologic findings that would implicate a specific infectious agent.\\n\\nCommunity-Acquired Pneumonia\\nThis patient's illness is consistent with the “atypical pneumonia syndrome” — that is, a febrile respiratory illness characterized by a nonproductive cough, relatively few findings on physical examination of the chest, and unilateral or bilateral patchy or streaky infiltrates on chest films. The chief causes of such infections are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and certain viruses. In individual cases, none of these infections are associated with sufficiently distinctive clinical or general laboratory findings to establish their diagnosis or rule them out. Clinically and epidemiologically, however, this patient's acute illness with fever, malaise, and cough is highly characteristic of a viral respiratory tract infection, especially influenza.\\n\\nInfluenza\\nJanuary has usually been one of the peak months of influenzavirus infection in the United States, as it was during the 1999–2000 influenza season,⁹ when an extensive outbreak of influenza A occurred (Fig. 7 and 8); the Boston area was affected by the outbreak. During that season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 99.5 percent of influenzavirus isolates were type A; the remainder were type B, which generally causes less extensive and less severe disease. In the setting of a community-wide outbreak of influenza A, the specificity of a clinical diagnosis of influenza A based on the presence of a febrile influenza-like illness is as high as 85 percent.¹⁰ An abrupt onset, as in this case, with prominent systemic symptoms early in the course of the illness, can be a striking feature — so much so that some patients recall the exact hour when the symptoms began.\\nThe majority of cases of influenza are characterized by an acute illness that usually resolves within a week — so-called uncomplicated influenza. Complications, particularly pneumonia, may develop during an epidemic, however, and have been reported to account for 2 to 18 percent of cases of pneumonia among hospitalized adults.¹¹,¹² Influenza-associated pneumonia ranges from a severe primary viral form, characterized by diffuse interstitial infiltrates and marked hypoxia, to a secondary bacterial form caused by Strep. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Staphylococcus aureus. There are also mixed viral and bacterial forms of pneumonia, with clinical features of both types, and mild or localized forms of viral pneumonia, in which radiographic patchy or localized infiltrates similar to those seen in this case are found.¹⁰\\nThe frequency of complications of influenza increases with an age of more than 55 years and with the presence of certain chronic conditions, several of which were present in this patient. These include chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, and immunosuppression due to an underlying disease or medication.¹³\\nAlthough this patient received influenza vaccine 11 weeks before the current admission,¹³ his immunosuppressed state may have prevented a sufficient immune response to the vaccine. Also, cyclosporine, which was included in the immunosuppressive regimen the patient was receiving when the vaccine was administered, has been associated with a particularly profound impairment of responses to influenza immunization.¹⁴,¹⁵\\n\\nOther Respiratory-Virus Infections\\nThere has been increasing recognition that other respiratory viruses can cause serious lower respiratory tract disease in adults, particularly those who are immunosuppressed. In a study of community-acquired pneumonia, respiratory syncytial virus was responsible for 4.4 percent of hospital admissions for pneumonia among adults, and this virus was second only to influenzavirus as a viral cause of pneumonia in that population.¹⁶ Pneumonia due to respiratory syncytial virus infection may be particularly severe in elderly or immunosuppressed persons and is a major cause of morbidity and death among patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transplants.¹⁷ The seasonal prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus infection often overlaps that of influenza. However, respiratory syncytial virus infection is usually associated with more prolonged upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms and a less abrupt onset of illness, and wheezing is a more common symptom of this infection. Nevertheless, the clinical and radiographic findings in adults with respiratory syncytial virus infection are not sufficiently distinctive to allow their differentiation from influenzavirus infection or from infections with other respiratory tract viruses.\\nParainfluenza viruses, among which serotypes 1, 2, and 3 are the most important clinically, are second in frequency only to respiratory syncytial virus as a lower respiratory tract pathogen in children and are the main causes of croup. These viruses can be associated with serious and even fatal infection in adults, particularly those who are immunosuppressed.¹⁸ The seasonal prevalence of parainfluenza virus infection varies more than that of respiratory syncytial virus infection or influenza.\\nFinally, adenoviruses, which can have a variety of clinical manifestations, including upper and lower respiratory tract infections, are more likely to cause illness in children than in adults, although the illness can be particularly severe in immunosuppressed adults.¹⁹\\n\\nConclusions\\nAlthough I cannot rule out the possibility that this patient was infected by another respiratory tract virus, such as influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, or adenovirus, an influenza A virus infection is most likely on the basis of epidemiologic information and the clinical findings. As for the diagnostic procedure, I would obtain a nasopharyngeal swab and request one of the rapid antigen assays for influenza A virus, which have a sensitivity of 60 to 80 percent and are highly specific.²⁰ If the results were negative, I would request a direct immunofluorescence assay on the swab specimen for influenza A and B viruses; respiratory syncytial virus; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3; and adenovirus. If these results were also negative and the patient was not recovering, I would probably perform a bronchoalveolar lavage and request broad microbiologic cultures and assays of the sample, including assays for P. carinii, mycoplasma, and chlamydia and a urinary antigen test for L. pneumophila.\\nDR. ROBERT E. SINGER (Family Practice): This patient's illness 13 months before the current admission was much more complex than the case record indicates. He was on a respirator for more than two months, and he had many complications that may have contributed to his subsequent illnesses, including endocarditis, renal failure, congestive heart failure, recurrent aspiration, and severe muscle weakness. When the patient was finally able to breathe on his own, he could not move his arms and legs initially, and he recovered muscle strength very slowly. We thought that the current illness was probably influenza A pneumonia or possibly pneumonia due to another respiratory tract virus.\\n\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\n? Pneumonia due to influenza or another respiratory tract virus.\\n\\nDR. RAPHAEL DOLIN'S DIAGNOSIS\\nInfluenza A pneumonitis.\\n\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. SINGER: A nasal-swab specimen was positive for influenza A virus. We continued the medications that the patient was already taking and administered amantadine for the viral infection. His condition improved considerably, and he was discharged home in good condition on the fourth hospital day.\\nDR. EUGENE J. MARK: The pathologic processes associated with pulmonary influenzavirus infection¹¹,²¹⁻²⁵ are listed in Table 4. The biopsy specimen obtained 34 months before the current admission showed the characteristic features of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (Fig. 1). Since this condition may be associated with influenzavirus infection, it is possible that the patient had influenza at the time that the pneumonia was diagnosed by biopsy. The biopsy specimen obtained during the second admission showed the characteristic features of organizing diffuse alveolar damage, which are also common features of influenza (Fig. 2, 3, 4, and 5). Since that biopsy specimen was obtained in January, when there are many cases of influenza, I suspect that influenza also had a role in the patient's illness at that time.\\nDR. SINGER: After discharge, the patient returned to his premorbid state. He is now frequently able to function without oxygen. The muscle strength is normal in his arms and only slightly diminished in his legs.\\nDR. DOLIN: The benefits of antiviral medication, such as amantadine, rimantadine, or the newer neuraminidase inhibitors, zanamivir and oseltamivir, have been documented in otherwise healthy young adults with uncomplicated disease, although the last two drugs have also been studied in patients at risk for complications. The duration of uncomplicated illness can be reduced by approximately 30 percent, but there is no evidence that complicated disease can be treated effectively with antiviral drugs. Whether these drugs would be effective in treating influenza pneumonitis of the type this patient had is unclear. However, I too would have tried an antiviral agent as part of the treatment.\\nThere is no clear evidence that any one of the antiviral agents is preferable to the others. It is important to remember, however, that amantadine and rimantadine are active against influenza A but not influenza B. Another consideration is the development of drug resistance, which seems to be less frequent with the use of the neuraminidase inhibitors. However, we have little experience with drug resistance, and it may prove to be a serious problem in the future. Zanamivir, which is administered with a disk inhaler, may precipitate bronchospasm in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease, so I would avoid its use in this patient. Amantadine in its generic form is considerably less expensive than the other drugs, a fact that argues in favor of its use.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Information Gathering:** The patient presents with a fever, cough, malaise, and dyspnea, which are classic symptoms of influenza. The onset of symptoms was abrupt, and the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly. The chest radiograph shows patchy and linear opacities in both lower lobes, which is consistent with pneumonia. The patient's history includes multiple hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses, including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and influenza, suggesting an underlying immunocompromised state. The patient's medications (cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, prednisone, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) are all immunosuppressants, increasing the risk of opportunistic infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Exacerbation of Chronic Pulmonary Process:** The patient has a history of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). While an exacerbation of these conditions is possible, the acute onset and systemic symptoms are less typical.\n",
      "    *   **Opportunistic Infection:** The patient is immunocompromised due to his medications. PCP, CMV, and other opportunistic infections are possible, but the lack of specific risk factors (e.g., HIV) and the absence of characteristic radiographic findings (e.g., diffuse interstitial infiltrates in PCP) make this less likely.\n",
      "    *   **Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP):** The patient's symptoms are consistent with CAP, but the presence of immunosuppression increases the risk of atypical pathogens and complications.\n",
      "    *   **Influenza:** The patient's recent influenza vaccination (11 weeks prior) and the timing of the illness (January) make influenza a strong possibility. The abrupt onset of symptoms, systemic symptoms, and the radiographic findings are all consistent with influenza pneumonitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Defining Features:** The key features supporting influenza pneumonitis are the abrupt onset of symptoms, the presence of systemic symptoms (fever, malaise), the radiographic findings (patchy and linear opacities), and the timing of the illness during influenza season.\n",
      "    *   **Discriminatory Features:** The patient's immunosuppressed state makes opportunistic infections a concern, but the lack of specific risk factors and the absence of characteristic radiographic findings make them less likely. The recent influenza vaccination also supports the diagnosis of influenza.\n",
      "    *   **Point-of-Care Tests:** A rapid influenza A/B test on a nasopharyngeal swab would be the most appropriate point-of-care test to confirm the diagnosis.\n",
      "    *   **Labs:** A complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and procalcitonin level would be helpful to assess the severity of the illness and rule out other causes of pneumonia.\n",
      "    *   **Imaging:** The chest radiograph is already suggestive of pneumonia. A CT scan of the chest may be considered if the diagnosis is uncertain or if the patient does not improve with treatment.\n",

      "{'query': \"A 57-year-old man was admitted to the hospital, for the sixth time, in January because of fever and cough.\\nThe patient had a 25-year history of seronegative rheumatoid arthritis and a 20-year history of diabetes mellitus type 2, complicated by retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy. One year before the first admission (34 months before the current admission) bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia was diagnosed on the basis of a biopsy (Fig. 1). Treatment with prednisone in small doses improved the patient's dyspnea.\\nWhile the prednisone dose was being tapered, symptoms consistent with recurrent bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, accompanied by skeletal-muscle weakness, esophageal dysmotility, and gastroparesis, led to the patient's first admission (22 months before the current admission). Polymyositis, which was positive for anti-Jo-1 antibody, was diagnosed. Treatment with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide relieved the dyspnea, and the patient was discharged on the 15th hospital day with instructions to take cyclophosphamide (125 mg daily), prednisone (60 mg daily), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (one double-strength tablet daily), and insulin.\\nNine months after discharge (13 months before the current admission), the patient spent 2 months in an intensive care unit because of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome; a thoracoscopic biopsy showed changes consistent with the presence of organizing, diffuse alveolar damage (Fig. 2, 3, 4, and 5). A test for human immunodeficiency virus antibody was negative. Coagulase-negative staphylococcal and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia developed, and a mitral-valve vegetation was detected on a transesophageal cardiac ultrasonographic study. The patient was discharged with instructions to take cyclophosphamide (75 mg daily), cyclosporine (175 mg twice a day), prednisone (10 mg daily), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\\nSix months before the current admission, the patient was hospitalized because of fever and possible aspiration pneumonia. Bronchoscopic examination showed evidence of aspiration in the larynx at the level of the vocal cords. A sputum culture yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae. Antibiotic therapy relieved the fever. The dose of cyclophosphamide was tapered, and the patient was discharged on the ninth hospital day while receiving cyclosporine (125 mg twice a day), prednisone (15 mg daily, subsequently increased to 50 mg daily), and a course of levofloxacin.\\nSixteen weeks before the current admission, the patient was hospitalized because of recurrent P. carinii pneumonia, for which pentamidine was administered intravenously. He was discharged on the 23rd hospital day while taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cyclosporine (100 mg twice a day), and prednisone (20 mg daily for 2 weeks, then 15 mg daily). Ten days later, the patient received an injection of influenza vaccine.\\nFive and a half weeks before the current admission, the patient was hospitalized because of a temperature of 38.3°C, without chills, cough, or dyspnea. The lungs were normal on physical and radiographic examinations. A blood culture yielded very fastidious viridans streptococci, which was sensitive to ceftriaxone. The patient was discharged on the sixth hospital day with instructions to continue taking ceftriaxone (2 g daily, administered intravenously). The dose of prednisone was tapered (from 15 to 5 mg daily), and the dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was reduced from one double-strength tablet daily to one tablet three times a week; the dose of cyclosporine was increased from 125 mg daily to 100 mg twice a day.\\nThe results of pulmonary-function studies performed one week before the current admission (Table 1) were consistent with the presence of a restrictive process as well as an obstructive process. One day before admission, malaise developed abruptly, with a nonproductive cough, a temperature that peaked at 38.9°C, a sore throat, and rhinorrhea. On the next day, the patient returned to the hospital.\\nThe patient had had no known exposure to sick persons or signs of worsening respiratory function. He had discontinued a 20-pack-year history of cigarette smoking 25 years earlier.\\nThe temperature was 38.0°C, the pulse was 97, and the respirations were 24. The blood pressure was 120/75 mm Hg. The arterial oxygen saturation was 98 percent while the patient was breathing ambient air. On examination, he coughed frequently and had dyspnea at rest. There were coarse breath sounds without dullness, wheezes, or crackles, as well as mild digital clubbing.\\nThe urine was positive (+++) for glucose and trace-positive for ketones. Laboratory tests were performed (Tables 2 and 3). A chest radiograph showed patchy and linear opacities in both lower lobes, with peribronchial thickening (Fig. 6).\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. RAPHAEL DOLIN*: May we see the radiographs?\\nDR. JO-ANNE O. SHEPARD (Cardiothoracic Radiology): A posteroanterior chest radiograph (Fig. 6) shows faint patchy and linear opacities at the lung bases, especially on the left side, with peribronchial thickening. There is no evidence of honeycomb changes.\\nDR. DOLIN: To explain the acute respiratory tract illness that precipitated the current admission, I shall consider three broad categories of disease: an exacerbation of a chronic pulmonary process, an opportunistic infection after immunosuppressive treatment, and respiratory tract infection with a community-acquired pathogen.\\n\\nExacerbation of a Chronic Pulmonary Process\\nChronic pulmonary processes have been associated with connective-tissue disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and polymyositis, both of which this patient had. The pulmonary lesions in rheumatoid arthritis, which are more common in seropositive cases than in seronegative cases, include pleuritis, pneumonitis, interstitial fibrosis, pleuropulmonary nodules, and arteritis.¹ Interstitial lung disease occurs in 5 to 10 percent of patients with polymyositis or dermatomyositis, especially in those with anti-Jo-1 antibody.² Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, which this patient also had, can be caused by infections, toxins, and inflammatory processes and has been associated with both rheumatoid arthritis and polymyositis.³ Pulmonary disease in patients with connective-tissue disorders tends to wax and wane with the activity of the underlying disease and treatment regimens. The results of this patient's pulmonary-function tests are consistent with the presence of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, or both, although the chest radiograph shows remarkably few abnormalities. An acute exacerbation of any of these chronic processes, however, would be very unlikely to explain the severe acute, systemic illness in this patient.\\n\\nOpportunistic Infection after Immunosuppressive Treatment\\nThe patient was receiving potent immunosuppressive therapy for 22 months before the current admission and had had two episodes of P. carinii pneumonia, a condition that is most common in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome but that also complicates both immunosuppressive and cytotoxic therapy.⁴⁻⁶ Assuming that he had adhered to the prophylactic regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which is highly effective, the acute illness that precipitated the current admission was probably not a third episode of P. carinii pneumonia. Also, the abrupt onset of his illness, particularly with the early prominence of systemic symptoms, is not characteristic of P. carinii pneumonia. Finally, although the radiographic findings associated with P. carinii pneumonia vary greatly and include patchy and linear pulmonary opacities, particularly in patients with previous pulmonary injury, the characteristic radiographic manifestation of this disease is the presence of diffuse interstitial infiltrates.\\nNeither the immunosuppression in this case nor the abrupt onset of the illness with upper respiratory tract involvement is characteristic of pneumonia due to cytomegalovirus, an important opportunistic pathogen that can cause disease by itself or in combination with other pathogens such as P. carinii.⁷,⁸ With respect to other opportunistic infections, the case record contains no information about environmental exposure, a history of travel, or microbiologic findings that would implicate a specific infectious agent.\\n\\nCommunity-Acquired Pneumonia\\nThis patient's illness is consistent with the “atypical pneumonia syndrome” — that is, a febrile respiratory illness characterized by a nonproductive cough, relatively few findings on physical examination of the chest, and unilateral or bilateral patchy or streaky infiltrates on chest films. The chief causes of such infections are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and certain viruses. In individual cases, none of these infections are associated with sufficiently distinctive clinical or general laboratory findings to establish their diagnosis or rule them out. Clinically and epidemiologically, however, this patient's acute illness with fever, malaise, and cough is highly characteristic of a viral respiratory tract infection, especially influenza.\\n\\nInfluenza\\nJanuary has usually been one of the peak months of influenzavirus infection in the United States, as it was during the 1999–2000 influenza season,⁹ when an extensive outbreak of influenza A occurred (Fig. 7 and 8); the Boston area was affected by the outbreak. During that season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 99.5 percent of influenzavirus isolates were type A; the remainder were type B, which generally causes less extensive and less severe disease. In the setting of a community-wide outbreak of influenza A, the specificity of a clinical diagnosis of influenza A based on the presence of a febrile influenza-like illness is as high as 85 percent.¹⁰ An abrupt onset, as in this case, with prominent systemic symptoms early in the course of the illness, can be a striking feature — so much so that some patients recall the exact hour when the symptoms began.\\nThe majority of cases of influenza are characterized by an acute illness that usually resolves within a week — so-called uncomplicated influenza. Complications, particularly pneumonia, may develop during an epidemic, however, and have been reported to account for 2 to 18 percent of cases of pneumonia among hospitalized adults.¹¹,¹² Influenza-associated pneumonia ranges from a severe primary viral form, characterized by diffuse interstitial infiltrates and marked hypoxia, to a secondary bacterial form caused by Strep. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Staphylococcus aureus. There are also mixed viral and bacterial forms of pneumonia, with clinical features of both types, and mild or localized forms of viral pneumonia, in which radiographic patchy or localized infiltrates similar to those seen in this case are found.¹⁰\\nThe frequency of complications of influenza increases with an age of more than 55 years and with the presence of certain chronic conditions, several of which were present in this patient. These include chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, and immunosuppression due to an underlying disease or medication.¹³\\nAlthough this patient received influenza vaccine 11 weeks before the current admission,¹³ his immunosuppressed state may have prevented a sufficient immune response to the vaccine. Also, cyclosporine, which was included in the immunosuppressive regimen the patient was receiving when the vaccine was administered, has been associated with a particularly profound impairment of responses to influenza immunization.¹⁴,¹⁵\\n\\nOther Respiratory-Virus Infections\\nThere has been increasing recognition that other respiratory viruses can cause serious lower respiratory tract disease in adults, particularly those who are immunosuppressed. In a study of community-acquired pneumonia, respiratory syncytial virus was responsible for 4.4 percent of hospital admissions for pneumonia among adults, and this virus was second only to influenzavirus as a viral cause of pneumonia in that population.¹⁶ Pneumonia due to respiratory syncytial virus infection may be particularly severe in elderly or immunosuppressed persons and is a major cause of morbidity and death among patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transplants.¹⁷ The seasonal prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus infection often overlaps that of influenza. However, respiratory syncytial virus infection is usually associated with more prolonged upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms and a less abrupt onset of illness, and wheezing is a more common symptom of this infection. Nevertheless, the clinical and radiographic findings in adults with respiratory syncytial virus infection are not sufficiently distinctive to allow their differentiation from influenzavirus infection or from infections with other respiratory tract viruses.\\nParainfluenza viruses, among which serotypes 1, 2, and 3 are the most important clinically, are second in frequency only to respiratory syncytial virus as a lower respiratory tract pathogen in children and are the main causes of croup. These viruses can be associated with serious and even fatal infection in adults, particularly those who are immunosuppressed.¹⁸ The seasonal prevalence of parainfluenza virus infection varies more than that of respiratory syncytial virus infection or influenza.\\nFinally, adenoviruses, which can have a variety of clinical manifestations, including upper and lower respiratory tract infections, are more likely to cause illness in children than in adults, although the illness can be particularly severe in immunosuppressed adults.¹⁹\\n\\nConclusions\\nAlthough I cannot rule out the possibility that this patient was infected by another respiratory tract virus, such as influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, or adenovirus, an influenza A virus infection is most likely on the basis of epidemiologic information and the clinical findings. As for the diagnostic procedure, I would obtain a nasopharyngeal swab and request one of the rapid antigen assays for influenza A virus, which have a sensitivity of 60 to 80 percent and are highly specific.²⁰ If the results were negative, I would request a direct immunofluorescence assay on the swab specimen for influenza A and B viruses; respiratory syncytial virus; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3; and adenovirus.

He did not lose consciousness or have tinnitus,\\nimpairment of hearing, otorrhea, or rhinorrhea. An\\nevaluation performed elsewhere showed erythema of\\nthe pinna and an unsteady gait. A cranial computed\\ntomographic (CT) study was said to show no abnor-\\nmality. Promethazine was prescribed, and the boy was\\nsent home. On the next day, he was anorectic, but the\\nvertigo had lessened. The day of admission, he was\\ndrowsy on awakening; vertigo and nausea worsened\\nrapidly, he began to vomit, and hearing was impaired\\nin his left ear. Later in the day, his temperature rose\\nto 39.4°C, with increasing drowsiness and a mild\\nheadache on the left side. An otolaryngologist noted\\na possible serous effusion in the left middle ear and\\nreferred the patient to the Massachusetts Eye and\\nEar Infirmary.\\nThe boy was said to have attention-deficit-hyper-\\nactivity disorder, with a slight learning disability and\\nsleepwalking. He resided with his parents and three\\nsiblings. He took clonidine (0.5 mg at bedtime) for\\nsleep.

The characteristic clinical manifestations\\nare hearing loss, which is usually conductive; bloody\\notorrhea; and unconsciousness.4 A longitudinal frac-\\nture of the temporal bone is unlikely in this case,\\nsince on otoscopic examination the eardrum did not\\nhave a bluish hue, which would have suggested hem-\\norrhage, and since there was no loss of consciousness.\\nTransverse fractures almost always result in vertigo,\\nwith severe sensorineural hearing loss and hemotym-\\npanum,¹ which was absent in this patient. Meningitis\\nafter temporal-bone fracture is usually associated with\\nleakage of cerebrospinal fluid, resulting from disrup-\\ntion of the roof of the middle ear and a tear in the\\ndura, but this complication is more commonly asso-\\nciated with longitudinal fractures than with transverse\\nfractures. 5,6 Cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea or rhinor-\\nrhea is generally present in patients with temporal-\\nbone fractures complicated by meningitis.\\nPerilymphatic Fistula\\nThe absence of the typical clinical and radiograph-\\nic features of a temporal-bone fracture strongly sug-\\ngests that this boy had a direct injury to the laby-\\nrinth, with a perilymphatic fistula communicating with\\nthe middle ear. This explanation accounts for the ini-\\ntial and subsequent clinical findings as well as the\\naudiographic finding of a mixed (sensorineural and\\nconductive) hearing loss, which indicates a combina-\\ntion of disorders in the inner and middle ear.\\nThe causes of perilymphatic fistula are listed in Ta-\\nble 2. In cases of traumatic perilymphatic fistula, ver-\\ntigo followed by progressive hearing loss often re-\\nsults from disruption of the oval or round window,\\nwith communication between the middle ear and the\\ninner ear.¹ A perilymphatic fistula of the oval win-\\ndow in a patient with a head injury may be associ-\\nated with fracture or dislocation of the footplate of\\nthe stapes, traumatic disruption of the oval window at\\nits attachment to the annular ligament of the stapes,8\\ndislocation of the ossicles, or, less often, fracture of\\nindividual ossicles. Stapediovestibular dislocation and\\nstapedial fracture have been reported to account for\\nnearly 10 percent of injuries involving ossicles. The\\ntype of injury that results in a perilymphatic fistula\\nmay be difficult to demonstrate on imaging studies.\\nIn the present case, the fistula may have been caused\\nby direct disruption of the oval or round window in\\nthe absence of a fracture of the temporal bone or in\\nthe presence of an occult fracture not seen on the\\nCT scan.\\nOne must also consider the possibility of a peri-\\nlymphatic fistula caused by aural barotrauma, in which\\nimplosive rupture of the oval or round window re-\\nsults from rapid contraction of the middle-ear air\\nspace. This type of injury could result from a ball hit-\\nting the ear and occluding the external auditory ca-\\nnal (Fig. 4).10\\nTABLE 2.

Spontaneous,\\nthird-degree horizontal nystagmus oriented toward\\nthe affected ear is usually seen after acute, severe in-\\njury to its labyrinth.11 In contrast, central nervous\\nsystem disorders typically cause vertical, rotatory, or\\nanterior-posterior nystagmus.12 Labyrinthine disor-\\nders that cause acute vertigo with spontaneous, third-\\ndegree nystagmus oriented toward an ear with acute\\nhearing loss include a crisis associated with Meniere's\\ndisease, labyrinthitis, trauma, and a complication of\\notitis media.\\nLabyrinthitis has been classified as serous, acute\\notogenic suppurative, or meningogenic suppurative.1\\nThe serous subtype is defined as labyrinthitis caused\\nby the entrance of blood, its byproducts, bacterial\\ntoxins, or chemical toxins into the labyrinth. A tran-\\nsition from serous to suppurative labyrinthitis results\\nwhen pyogenic bacteria enter the inner ear. This se-\\nquence can be a complication of acute otitis media.\\nPhysical examination in such cases typically shows a\\nbulging, red tympanic membrane. Bacteria may also\\nenter the inner ear in patients with chronic otitis me-\\ndia. In this case, however, there is no evidence of acute\\nor chronic otitis media. Meningogenic suppurative\\nlabyrinthitis is due to meningitis with a nonotologic\\ncause. In such cases, symptoms of meningitis typi-\\ncally precede the hearing loss and vertigo.13 The diag-\\nnosis of serous labyrinthitis, with early progression to\\nsuppurative labyrinthitis, best explains acute aural trau-\\nma associated with symptoms that are consistent with\\nthe presence of a perilymphatic fistula and the subse-\\nquent development of nausea, vomiting, nystagmus,\\nand mixed sensorineural and conductive hearing loss.\\nMeningitis\\nThis boy had nuchal rigidity, headache, altered\\nmental status, fever, and leukocytosis with a leftward\\nN Engl J Med, Vol. 345, No. 26 December 27, 2001 www.nejm.org 1903\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

In the absence of an obvious fracture or of an-\\nother site of cerebrospinal fluid leakage in this case,\\nthe meningitis is probably due to labyrinthitis.\\nThe trauma in this patient could easily have caused\\na communication between the middle and inner ear,\\nbut it is more difficult to explain the communication\\nbetween the labyrinth and the cerebrospinal fluid com-\\npartment on the basis of the clinical and radiograph-\\nic findings. Congenital anomalies of the inner ear may\\nhave had a role. For example, an incompetent lateral\\nwall of the internal auditory canal (the internal audi-\\ntory meatus) or a patent cochlear aqueduct (a thin ca-\\nnal passing through bone from the inner ear into the\\nsubarachnoid compartment) may allow such a com-\\nmunication (Fig. 5). These anomalies may not be de-\\ntected on standard imaging studies and were not seen\\nin this case.18 Although convincing radiographic evi-\\ndence of a wide cochlear aqueduct is lacking in the\\nliterature, 18 radiographic studies with the use of con-\\ntrast material and anatomical studies support the oc-\\ncurrence of this form of communication.19,20\\nThe diagnostic procedure in this case was probably\\na lumbar puncture, followed shortly thereafter by\\nan exploratory tympanotomy.

HADLOCK (Otolaryngology): Fluid\\nobtained from a lumbar puncture contained white\\ncells and gram-positive diplococci. We immediately\\nperformed an exploratory tympanotomy. We did not\\nsee a serous effusion behind the tympanic membrane,\\nbut loculated, submucosal serous fluid was present\\nin the middle ear, which best explains the opacifica-\\ntion seen on the CT scan.\\nThe ossicles, including the footplate of the stapes,\\nappeared to be intact, with no obvious leakage of\\nfluid along the annular ligament of the stapes. How-\\never, we did find a fistula through the round window,\\nwith pooling of fluid within the middle ear (Fig. 5).\\nWe sealed the opening of the fistula with a piece of\\ntragal perichondrium, and we wrapped an additional\\npiece of perichondrium around the annular ligament\\nof the stapes in case we had missed a tiny leak\\naround the oval window.\\nA PHYSICIAN: Are there any other imaging tech-\\nniques that can be used to detect a connection be-\\ntween the labyrinth and the cerebrospinal fluid com-\\npartment?\\nDR. MEGERIAN: Imaging can be performed after\\nthe administration of either radionucleotide or radi-\\nopaque tracers at the time of the lumbar puncture.\\nIn one study, this technique demonstrated the pas-\\nsage of the tracer through the lateral part of the in-\\nternal auditory canal.21 If this patient had an enlarged\\nor patent cochlear aqueduct, this type of imaging\\nmay be able to demonstrate leakage of cerebrospinal\\nfluid into the labyrinth and then into the middle ear\\nthrough the defect in the round window.\\nA PHYSICIAN: Would it be clinically important at\\nthis point to establish the source of the leak with this\\ntechnique?\\nDR. MEGERIAN: Not now, since the surgeons have\\nrepaired the labyrinthine fistula.\\n1906 DR. CURTIN: The only studies I have seen in which\\nimaging demonstrated sites of cerebrospinal fluid\\nleakage involved cases in which radiopaque contrast\\nmaterial injected by lumbar puncture filled the laby-\\nrinth through an obvious defect in the lateral part of\\nthe internal auditory canal. In this case, in which our\\nimaging did not reveal any enlargement of the coch-\\nlear aqueduct, it is unlikely that a leak would have\\nbeen large enough to detect with the use of contrast\\nmaterial.\\nDR. KRUSKAL: The patient was treated as an inpa-\\ntient for two weeks. A blood culture revealed Strep-\\ntococcus pneumoniae. Vancomycin (600 mg every six\\nhours) and aztreonam (30 mg every six hours) were\\nadministered intravenously. Subsequent blood cul-\\ntures were negative.

He did not lose consciousness or have tinnitus,\\nimpairment of hearing, otorrhea, or rhinorrhea. An\\nevaluation performed elsewhere showed erythema of\\nthe pinna and an unsteady gait. A cranial computed\\ntomographic (CT) study was said to show no abnor-\\nmality. Promethazine was prescribed, and the boy was\\nsent home. On the next day, he was anorectic, but the\\nvertigo had lessened. The day of admission, he was\\ndrowsy on awakening; vertigo and nausea worsened\\nrapidly, he began to vomit, and hearing was impaired\\nin his left ear. Later in the day, his temperature rose\\nto 39.4°C, with increasing drowsiness and a mild\\nheadache on the left side. An otolaryngologist noted\\na possible serous effusion in the left middle ear and\\nreferred the patient to the Massachusetts Eye and\\nEar Infirmary.\\nThe boy was said to have attention-deficit-hyper-\\nactivity disorder, with a slight learning disability and\\nsleepwalking. He resided with his parents and three\\nsiblings. He took clonidine (0.5 mg at bedtime) for\\nsleep. There was no family history of neurologic dis-\\norders.\\nThe temperature was 39.1°C, the pulse was 125,\\nand the respirations were 14.

There was third-\\ndegree horizontal nystagmus with a rapid component\\non the left side. Strength was full and symmetric in\\nthe arms and legs. An audiographic examination re-\\nvealed a 65-dB mixed hearing loss on the left side,\\nwith a sensorineural threshold of 25 dB and an ad-\\nditional 40 dB of conductive loss. The results of lab-\\noratory tests are presented in Table 1.\\nA CT scan of the temporal bones (Fig. 1, 2, and\\n3), obtained without the administration of contrast\\nmaterial, showed that fluid with the density of soft\\ntissue had filled most of the middle ear on the left\\nside, with a small amount of fluid in the mastoid.\\nThe left tympanic membrane bulged laterally; the\\nadjacent jugular-vein bulb was more prominent than\\nusual. There was no evident disruption or fracture of\\nthe ossicles or fracture of the temporal bone. The\\nvestibular aqueduct appeared normal; no congenital\\nanomaly of the labyrinth was detected. The ventricles\\nwere a little more prominent than usual. Air-fluid\\nlevels and mucosal swelling were evident in both max-\\nillary antrums.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. CLIFF A. MEGERIAN*: May we review the\\nimaging studies?\\nDR. HUGH D. CURTIN (Head and Neck Radiol-\\nogy): The axial images from the CT scan (Fig. 1 and\\n2) show fluid with the density of soft tissue filling\\nmost of the middle ear on the left side, with fluid in\\nthe mastoid. The abnormality protrudes above and\\nbelow the malleus, suggesting that it was limited by\\nthe tympanic membrane (Fig. 3).\\nDR. MEGERIAN: I will first discuss the anatomical\\nchanges that probably followed this boy's aural trau-\\nma and will then consider the probable evolution of\\nthese changes, leading to the more severe aural symp-\\ntoms and probable meningitis two days after the\\ninjury.\\nImmediate Effects of Aural Trauma\\nSudden vertigo and nausea after blunt trauma to\\nthe ear can be caused by a fracture of the temporal\\nbone, with damage to the inner ear (the labyrinth)\\nor by a perilymphatic fistula (a passage from the per-\\nilymphatic space between the membranous and bony\\nlabyrinth to the middle ear [tympanum], with or\\nwithout a fracture of the temporal bone).1,2 A tem-\\nporal-bone fracture is classified as transverse or lon-\\ngitudinal, depending on its orientation to the axis of\\nthe petrous pyramid.3 Longitudinal fractures, which\\nare much more common, typically result in bleeding\\nfrom the ear, because the line of fracture usually goes\\n*Director of Otology and Neurotology, Department of Otolaryngol-\\nogy-Head and Neck Surgery, UMass Memorial Medical Center; associate\\nprofessor of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, University of Massa-\\nchusetts Medical School both in Worcester.\\n1902 N Engl J Med, Vol. 345, No. 26 December 27, 2001 www.nejm.org\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

The characteristic clinical manifestations\\nare hearing loss, which is usually conductive; bloody\\notorrhea; and unconsciousness.4 A longitudinal frac-\\nture of the temporal bone is unlikely in this case,\\nsince on otoscopic examination the eardrum did not\\nhave a bluish hue, which would have suggested hem-\\norrhage, and since there was no loss of consciousness.\\nTransverse fractures almost always result in vertigo,\\nwith severe sensorineural hearing loss and hemotym-\\npanum,¹ which was absent in this patient. Meningitis\\nafter temporal-bone fracture is usually associated with\\nleakage of cerebrospinal fluid, resulting from disrup-\\ntion of the roof of the middle ear and a tear in the\\ndura, but this complication is more commonly asso-\\nciated with longitudinal fractures than with transverse\\nfractures. 5,6 Cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea or rhinor-\\nrhea is generally present in patients with temporal-\\nbone fractures complicated by meningitis.\\nPerilymphatic Fistula\\nThe absence of the typical clinical and radiograph-\\nic features of a temporal-bone fracture strongly sug-\\ngests that this boy had a direct injury to the laby-\\nrinth, with a perilymphatic fistula communicating with\\nthe middle ear. This explanation accounts for the ini-\\ntial and subsequent clinical findings as well as the\\naudiographic finding of a mixed (sensorineural and\\nconductive) hearing loss, which indicates a combina-\\ntion of disorders in the inner and middle ear.\\nThe causes of perilymphatic fistula are listed in Ta-\\nble 2. In cases of traumatic perilymphatic fistula, ver-\\ntigo followed by progressive hearing loss often re-\\nsults from disruption of the oval or round window,\\nwith communication between the middle ear and the\\ninner ear.¹ A perilymphatic fistula of the oval win-\\ndow in a patient with a head injury may be associ-\\nated with fracture or dislocation of the footplate of\\nthe stapes, traumatic disruption of the oval window at\\nits attachment to the annular ligament of the stapes,8\\ndislocation of the ossicles, or, less often, fracture of\\nindividual ossicles. Stapediovestibular dislocation and\\nstapedial fracture have been reported to account for\\nnearly 10 percent of injuries involving ossicles. The\\ntype of injury that results in a perilymphatic fistula\\nmay be difficult to demonstrate on imaging studies.\\nIn the present case, the fistula may have been caused\\nby direct disruption of the oval or round window in\\nthe absence of a fracture of the temporal bone or in\\nthe presence of an occult fracture not seen on the\\nCT scan.\\nOne must also consider the possibility of a peri-\\nlymphatic fistula caused by aural barotrauma, in which\\nimplosive rupture of the oval or round window re-\\nsults from rapid contraction of the middle-ear air\\nspace. This type of injury could result from a ball hit-\\nting the ear and occluding the external auditory ca-\\nnal (Fig. 4).10\\nTABLE 2.

Spontaneous,\\nthird-degree horizontal nystagmus oriented toward\\nthe affected ear is usually seen after acute, severe in-\\njury to its labyrinth.11 In contrast, central nervous\\nsystem disorders typically cause vertical, rotatory, or\\nanterior-posterior nystagmus.12 Labyrinthine disor-\\nders that cause acute vertigo with spontaneous, third-\\ndegree nystagmus oriented toward an ear with acute\\nhearing loss include a crisis associated with Meniere's\\ndisease, labyrinthitis, trauma, and a complication of\\notitis media.\\nLabyrinthitis has been classified as serous, acute\\notogenic suppurative, or meningogenic suppurative.1\\nThe serous subtype is defined as labyrinthitis caused\\nby the entrance of blood, its byproducts, bacterial\\ntoxins, or chemical toxins into the labyrinth. A tran-\\nsition from serous to suppurative labyrinthitis results\\nwhen pyogenic bacteria enter the inner ear. This se-\\nquence can be a complication of acute otitis media.\\nPhysical examination in such cases typically shows a\\nbulging, red tympanic membrane. Bacteria may also\\nenter the inner ear in patients with chronic otitis me-\\ndia. In this case, however, there is no evidence of acute\\nor chronic otitis media. Meningogenic suppurative\\nlabyrinthitis is due to meningitis with a nonotologic\\ncause. In such cases, symptoms of meningitis typi-\\ncally precede the hearing loss and vertigo.13 The diag-\\nnosis of serous labyrinthitis, with early progression to\\nsuppurative labyrinthitis, best explains acute aural trau-\\nma associated with symptoms that are consistent with\\nthe presence of a perilymphatic fistula and the subse-\\nquent development of nausea, vomiting, nystagmus,\\nand mixed sensorineural and conductive hearing loss.\\nMeningitis\\nThis boy had nuchal rigidity, headache, altered\\nmental status, fever, and leukocytosis with a leftward\\nN Engl J Med, Vol. 345, No. 26 December 27, 2001 www.nejm.org 1903\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

In the absence of an obvious fracture or of an-\\nother site of cerebrospinal fluid leakage in this case,\\nthe meningitis is probably due to labyrinthitis.\\nThe trauma in this patient could easily have caused\\na communication between the middle and inner ear,\\nbut it is more difficult to explain the communication\\nbetween the labyrinth and the cerebrospinal fluid com-\\npartment on the basis of the clinical and radiograph-\\nic findings. Congenital anomalies of the inner ear may\\nhave had a role. For example, an incompetent lateral\\nwall of the internal auditory canal (the internal audi-\\ntory meatus) or a patent cochlear aqueduct (a thin ca-\\nnal passing through bone from the inner ear into the\\nsubarachnoid compartment) may allow such a com-\\nmunication (Fig. 5). These anomalies may not be de-\\ntected on standard imaging studies and were not seen\\nin this case.18 Although convincing radiographic evi-\\ndence of a wide cochlear aqueduct is lacking in the\\nliterature, 18 radiographic studies with the use of con-\\ntrast material and anatomical studies support the oc-\\ncurrence of this form of communication.19,20\\nThe diagnostic procedure in this case was probably\\na lumbar puncture, followed shortly thereafter by\\nan exploratory tympanotomy.

HADLOCK (Otolaryngology): Fluid\\nobtained from a lumbar puncture contained white\\ncells and gram-positive diplococci. We immediately\\nperformed an exploratory tympanotomy. We did not\\nsee a serous effusion behind the tympanic membrane,\\nbut loculated, submucosal serous fluid was present\\nin the middle ear, which best explains the opacifica-\\ntion seen on the CT scan.\\nThe ossicles, including the footplate of the stapes,\\nappeared to be intact, with no obvious leakage of\\nfluid along the annular ligament of the stapes. How-\\never, we did find a fistula through the round window,\\nwith pooling of fluid within the middle ear (Fig. 5).\\nWe sealed the opening of the fistula with a piece of\\ntragal perichondrium, and we wrapped an additional\\npiece of perichondrium around the annular ligament\\nof the stapes in case we had missed a tiny leak\\naround the oval window.\\nA PHYSICIAN: Are there any other imaging tech-\\nniques that can be used to detect a connection be-\\ntween the labyrinth and the cerebrospinal fluid com-\\npartment?\\nDR. MEGERIAN: Imaging can be performed after\\nthe administration of either radionucleotide or radi-\\nopaque tracers at the time of the lumbar puncture.\\nIn one study, this technique demonstrated the pas-\\nsage of the tracer through the lateral part of the in-\\nternal auditory canal.21 If this patient had an enlarged\\nor patent cochlear aqueduct, this type of imaging\\nmay be able to demonstrate leakage of cerebrospinal\\nfluid into the labyrinth and then into the middle ear\\nthrough the defect in the round window.\\nA PHYSICIAN: Would it be clinically important at\\nthis point to establish the source of the leak with this\\ntechnique?\\nDR. MEGERIAN: Not now, since the surgeons have\\nrepaired the labyrinthine fistula.\\n1906 DR. CURTIN: The only studies I have seen in which\\nimaging demonstrated sites of cerebrospinal fluid\\nleakage involved cases in which radiopaque contrast\\nmaterial injected by lumbar puncture filled the laby-\\nrinth through an obvious defect in the lateral part of\\nthe internal auditory canal. In this case, in which our\\nimaging did not reveal any enlargement of the coch-\\nlear aqueduct, it is unlikely that a leak would have\\nbeen large enough to detect with the use of contrast\\nmaterial.\\nDR. KRUSKAL: The patient was treated as an inpa-\\ntient for two weeks. A blood culture revealed Strep-\\ntococcus pneumoniae. Vancomycin (600 mg every six\\nhours) and aztreonam (30 mg every six hours) were\\nadministered intravenously. Subsequent blood cul-\\ntures were negative. A week after discharge from the\\nhospital, the boy appeared to be well, except for a\\npersistent hearing loss on the left side.\\n\", 'images_used': [], 'answer': 'WORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Acute bacterial labyrinthitis and meningitis secondary to traumatic perilymphatic fistula.\\nDISEASE_NAME: Bacterial Labyrinthitis and Meningitis\\n\\n**Reasoning:**\\n\\n1.  **Information Gathering:**\\n\\n    *   **Key Signs/Symptoms:** Fever, headache, vertigo, vomiting, drowsiness, nystagmus, hearing loss, neck stiffness.\\n    *   **Duration:** Symptoms started two days before admission, with worsening over the next day.\\n    *   **Epidemiologic Context:** No specific travel or residence information provided, but the case is from Massachusetts General Hospital.

Initially they traveled throughout Brazil, including the Amazonian basin, up to the border of Peru. During this portion of the trip, the patient and his wife had an episode of fever and diarrhea, all of which resolved within days. They then spent three days in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before flying to the Republic of South Africa, where they spent four weeks in Johannesburg and in Kruger National Park. The following week, they drove across Zimbabwe, where they passed through Victoria Falls National Park, and then proceeded to Zambia, where they spent two days. After visiting Nairobi, Kenya, for one day, they stayed in Tanzania for two weeks. They climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro and then proceeded to the Serengeti plain, where they both received multiple tsetse-fly bites, 11 and 10 days before the patient’s admission. They then visited Ngorongoro Crater, Arusha, and Moshi. After spending another day in Nairobi, they flew to Katmandu, Nepal, after having spent a night in Bahrain en route.\\nFour days before admission, while in Katmandu, the patient was awakened at 3 a.m. by high fever and pain in the left foot. Headache, fatigue, and severe myalgia developed, and the next day his temperature rose to 40.1°C. Dyspnea developed, his urine became darker, and the dorsum of the left foot became erythematous and tender. The next day, the temperature rose to 40.6°C, the left foot became swollen, and necrosis was observed in the center of the erythematous area. The patient was evaluated at a clinic in Katmandu. His complete blood count was normal, and two blood smears showed no evidence of malaria; the results of liver-function tests were marginally abnormal. Cephalexin (500 mg four times a day) was prescribed, but the following day the fever persisted. The white-cell count was 4000 per cubic millimeter, with 10 percent band forms; additional blood smears showed no malarial parasites. Vomiting and crampy abdominal pain developed and were accompanied by intermittent headache; pharyngitis; a diffuse, blanching, macular rash; and a temperature as high as 41.1°C. He returned to the United States and was admitted to this hospital.\\nThe patient resided in Colorado, worked in construction, and climbed mountains by avocation. He had traveled extensively in the past and reported that his hepatitis A and hepatitis B immunizations were up to date; he had had no documentation of recent vaccination against yellow fever and thus had received it again while in South Africa. He had not consulted a physician during the period immediately before the current trip and was not receiving chemoprophylaxis against malaria. He had not had typhoid vaccine in recent years and had never required rabies vaccine. He had no known allergies, and after finishing the course of cephalexin, he was taking no medications. In previous years he had undergone orthopedic surgical procedures that involved his knees and right shoulder. His medical history was otherwise unremarkable. He had been prostrate during his illness in Katmandu but had not had frank chills, visual changes, diarrhea, dysuria, arthralgia, or cognitive problems. His wife remained well.\\nThe temperature was 39.4°C, and the pulse was 85. The blood pressure was 120/60 mm Hg.\\nOn physical examination, the patient appeared dehydrated. A macular rash (Fig. 1) involved the entire trunk except for the groin and blanched with pressure. No cervical lymphadenopathy was found; tender, bilateral axillary lymph nodes, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, and a tender left femoral lymph node, 2 cm in diameter, were palpated. The conjunctivae were injected, and the sclerae were mildly icteric; the optic fundi were normal. The oropharynx was erythematous, without exudate. The lungs and heart were normal. The liver descended 3 cm below the right costal margin, and the splenic tip was palpated. The genitalia were normal. A shallow ulceration was present on the dorsum of the left foot, surrounded by a ring that contained bullae and that was, in turn, surrounded by another ring, characterized by violaceous erythema and induration; the entire lesion (Fig. 2), which was approximately 5 cm in diameter, was painful. There was no peripheral edema. Neurologic examination showed that the patient was mentally sound; the cranial-nerve functions were preserved; the sensation, muscle strength, and tendon reflexes were normal.\\nThe urine was positive for protein (+) and bilirubin (++); the sediment contained no red cells, 5 to 10 white cells, and moderate numbers of bacteria per high-power field. The abnormal laboratory values are shown in Table 1. The levels of urea nitrogen, total protein and albumin, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, glucose, uric acid, phosphorus, magnesium, creatine kinase, amylase, and lipase and the mean corpuscular volume and partial-thromboplastin time were normal. An electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities. Chest radiographs disclosed patchy opacities in the left lower lobe, a finding consistent with the presence of atelectasis or, perhaps, pneumonia; the size of the heart was normal. Orthopedic hardware consistent with a previous rotator-cuff repair was observed in the right humerus.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. ANNE C. MOORE*: This case illustrates the challenges involved in evaluating a febrile traveler returning from the tropics. The patient may have been exposed to common causes of fever at home, to infectious agents present at home but more common overseas, or to pathogens endemic in tropical areas. In addition to having a complex travel history, he received no chemoprophylaxis against malaria and had not consulted a physician for pretravel medical advice or immunizations.\\nMalaria is an important diagnosis to consider. It is the most common cause of fever in patients who are hospitalized after traveling in the tropics, accounting for 32 to 42 percent of cases.1,2 The incidence of malaria depends on the area visited and the season, but it is approximately 2 percent per month among visitors to Africa who do not receive chemoprophylaxis.3 Do the negative smears for malaria before admission rule out this diagnosis? In a laboratory with experience in the diagnosis of malaria, the diagnosis in most cases is made on examination of a single thick blood smear. However, the level of parasites in the blood may be low or undetectable in nonimmune persons with early infection or in those who have taken an antimalarial drug. Another examination for malaria is advisable.\\nOther common causes of undifferentiated fever in travelers include enteric fever, which may be caused either by Salmonella typhi or by S. paratyphi, and dengue fever. The incubation period of dengue is not consistent with this patient's history of possible exposures, but enteric fever should be considered. According to the patient's itinerary and activities, his fever could also be due to borreliosis (relapsing fever), brucellosis, rickettsiosis (due to Rickettsia conorii or R. africae), African trypanosomiasis, or one of several arboviral infections.\\nA salient feature of the case is the cutaneous lesion on the patient's left foot. The most frequently seen cutaneous ulcer in travelers is a bacterial pyoderma caused by secondary infection of a minor wound or an insect bite with Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, or both pathogens. However, the patient does not have leukocytosis, and the appearance of his lesion does not suggest that it is a pyoderma. Tularemia is clinically consistent with the features of this patient's illness, but it is a disease of the Northern Hemisphere and does not occur in the areas he visited. Cutaneous anthrax is another consideration. Bacillus anthracis is found widely in Africa, and inoculation of the spores can occur at a minor abrasion of the skin or as a result of contact with contaminated animal hair or hides, soil contaminated by sick animals, or rarely, biting flies. The lesions of cutaneous anthrax are usually painless, however, and high fever is not typical.\\nThe patient's exposures and the features of the lesion suggest that the lesion is a chancre of African trypanosomiasis at the inoculation site of the pathogen. A lesion at the site of inoculation (a chagoma) is sometimes observed in patients with American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease). However, the interval between the patient's visit to areas of South America where Chagas' disease is endemic and the development of his lesion was considerably longer than the incubation period of a chagoma (which is one to two weeks).\\nThis patient is known to me because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided the drug for his treatment. The diagnostic procedure was examination of the patient's blood, in which trypanosomes were found. Trypanosomiasis in humans may be caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (in Chagas' disease) and by two subspecies of T. brucei (in African trypanosomiasis). On microscopical examination, T. cruzi can be distinguished from T. brucei; the subspecies of T. brucei, however, are morphologically identical. It is important to identify the type of African trypanosomiasis because the type of infection will guide the choice of therapy. The assignment is generally made on the basis of the history — particularly the geographic site of exposure — and the clinical features (Table 2).\\nI shall discuss this case as one of known East African trypanosomiasis. This disease is very rare in the United States. Only 30 cases have been reported since 1967, when the CDC began conducting surveillance of this infection with the use of data collected during the release of drugs for its treatment. The CDC is the sole supplier of these agents in this country. Although imported cases of African trypanosomiasis are seen infrequently, correct diagnosis is essential because the untreated infection is almost invariably fatal.\\nAfrican trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is acquired through the bites of infected tsetse flies. Transmission occurs only in the middle latitudes of Africa, where the vector is found. The infection occurs in two epidemiologically distinct forms. East African trypanosomiasis, caused by T. brucei rhodesiense, is a zoonosis and primarily affects wild animals and livestock. Sporadic cases of infection may be seen in humans (hunters, game wardens, and tourists, for instance), as can community outbreaks, in which domestic cattle serve as reservoirs.4 Humans are the only important reservoirs in the West African form of the disease, which is caused by T. brucei gambiense. Transmission of the West African infection occurs in rural, forested areas, particularly near rivers or watering spots, where humans most frequently come into contact with tsetse flies.\\nAlmost all cases of African trypanosomiasis imported by travelers returning to the United States are the East African form of the disease.5 Most patients with T. brucei rhodesiense infection reported to the CDC (27 of 30) acquired it while participating in organized photographic or hunting safaris. Between 1967 and 2000, one case of East African trypanosomiasis occurred, on average, every 1.5 years. In 2001, we observed a striking increase in the incidence of imported infection. Seven travelers from the United States and one from Canada were infected with T. brucei rhodesiense. A similar increase was observed among European travelers.6,7 Tanzania was the most common geographic site of infection.8-10 The exact number of people who travel from the United States to African game reserves is unknown, so the predominance of cases in Tanzania may reflect a large number of tourist visits there as well as a country-specific risk. Tourists rarely acquire T. brucei gambiense infection because they seldom visit the rural areas of Central and West Africa where the disease is transmitted. Since 1967, three travelers have become infected with T. brucei gambiense; however, five imported cases have been diagnosed in African nationals living in the United States.11-14\\nAfrican trypanosomiasis is characterized by the development of a lesion at the inoculation site, followed by parasitemia, hemolymphatic involvement, and eventually invasion of the central nervous system, which leads to meningoencephalitis, coma, and death. East African infection follows an acute course in which there is early involvement of the central nervous system, often within three to four weeks after inoculation. West African infection is more indolent and progresses over months to years, reflecting the adaptation of T. brucei gambiense to its reservoir host.\\nThe immune response to the infection and the pathogenesis of the disease are complex and poorly understood. Antigenic variation is one of several mechanisms used by T. brucei to evade immune destruction.15 Trypanosomes in the bloodstream are able to change the antigenic structure of their glycoprotein coat periodically by switching the antigen-encoding gene that is expressed at any given time. The host mounts a response to each successive surface antigen, but it cannot completely clear the infection before the appearance of a new subpopulation of trypanosomes. A key feature of the host response is generalized immunosuppression, which is accompanied by polyclonal activation of B cells and leads to the production of large amounts of nonspecific IgM. The resulting circulating immune complexes may have a role in the anemia, vascular permeability, and tissue damage observed in trypanosomiasis. The disease can affect most organs, but pathologic changes in the reticuloendothelial, cardiac, and nervous systems predominate.\\nThe first sign of infection is a painful chancre, which develops at the site of the tsetse-fly bite within one to two weeks after the bite. Such a chancre is observed in half the Europeans infected with T. brucei rhodesiense, but it is seldom evident in Africans infected with T. brucei gambiense.16 The chancre is typically large (2 to 5 cm in diameter) and indurated, and it may ulcerate; resolution occurs within a few weeks. During the hemolymphatic stage of the disease (stage 1), parasites enter the bloodstream, and intermittent episodes of high fever develop. In the acute, East African form of trypanosomiasis, this stage generally occurs within one to three weeks after the bite. Clinical manifestations vary greatly, but arthralgias, malaise, localized facial edema, and moderate splenomegaly are common. A characteristic macular rash is often present on the trunk. Myocarditis is observed mostly in cases of T. brucei rhodesiense infection, and cardiac involvement (arrhythmias or cardiac failure) is observed in 25 percent of infected U.S. travelers. Hematologic manifestations of the disease frequently include normocytic anemia. Thrombocytopenia is almost always present. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is an uncommon complication.17\\nInvolvement of the central nervous system (stage 2) is characterized by the development of severe headache and somnolence progressing to coma. A wide range of neurologic symptoms is manifested in West African trypanosomiasis. Patients may have changes in behavior, psychosis, tremors, ataxia, neuroendocrine disorders, and in occasional cases, focal neurologic findings or seizures. Weight loss occurs and may be marked. The acute course typical of East African infection tends to blur the distinction between the stages of infection, and patients have a narrower range of neurologic symptoms before the onset of coma than those with West African trypanosomiasis.\\nThe diagnosis of African trypanosomiasis rests on identification of the parasite. The parasite can often be found in fluid expressed from a chancre. Infection with T. brucei rhodesiense is usually confirmed by observation of trypanosomes in a Giemsa-stained blood smear or in wet blood preparations. Examination of the buffy coat increases the sensitivity of these techniques. A wet preparation of this patient's blood showing motile T. brucei rhodesiense organisms can be viewed on the CDC Web site, at http://www.dpd. cdc.gov/dpdx/html/trypanosomiasisafrican.htm.\\nDR. ROBERT E. SCULLY (Pathology): Dr. Ryan, what were your impressions when you saw this patient?\\nDR. EDWARD T. RYAN (Infectious Diseases): The diagnosis of East African trypanosomiasis was first made by the physicians and staff at the Canadian International Water and Energy Consultant Clinic in Katmandu. Because of the inavailability of effective medication in that geographic area, the patient was rapidly transferred to this hospital.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nEast African trypanosomiasis.\\nDR. ANNE C. MOORE'S DIAGNOSIS\\nEast African trypanosomiasis (Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense infection).\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. RYAN: We confirmed the diagnosis by examining fluid from the chancre and specimens of peripheral blood.\\nMS. MARY ANN WALDRON (Parasitology): In the parasitology laboratory, an aspirate from the wound was examined as a wet preparation, and a blood specimen was examined as thick and thin Giemsa-stained smears, buffy-coat concentrates, and direct specimens. The morphologically indistinguishable trypomastigotes of T. brucei gambiense or T. brucei rhodesiense were seen in all the specimens (two to four per highpower field) (Fig. 3). The kinetoplast (a DNA-containing organelle associated with the mitochondrion) is located close to the posterior end; a flagellum extends from the kinetoplast, forms the edge of an undulating membrane, and then extends as a free flagellum at the anterior end. The organism is 15 to 30 µm in length and 1.5 to 3.5 µm in width. A nucleus is centrally located within it.\\nDR. MOORE: Because the level of parasites in the blood is generally high in T. brucei rhodesiense infection, the diagnosis is often an accidental finding when smears are examined for malaria. In T. brucei gambiense infection, in contrast, the level of parasites in the blood is low, and they are difficult to detect. Serial examinations of blood specimens or lymph-node aspirates may be needed because the degree of parasitemia varies with time. Concentration techniques18,19 are often used. Currently, the roles of in vitro isolation20 and the polymerase chain reaction in diagnosis13,21 are undefined.\\nNo serologic test of high sensitivity and specificity is available for the diagnosis of East African trypanosomiasis. The diversity of circulating T. brucei rhodesiense genotypes and the extensive repertoire of surface glycoproteins have hampered the development of an antibody test. However, a serologic test for T. brucei rhodesiense would probably not be a diagnostic improvement, because the incubation period is short and because the identification of parasites in the blood is not difficult in most cases. There is less diversity among the variable antigens of T. brucei gambiense, and antibody tests have been developed; a simple card-agglutination test22 can be used to identify the organism in suspected cases of West African trypanosomiasis. Nonspecific reactions can occur; therefore, a seropositive test result cannot be used for definitive diagnosis. A test for parasite antigen has been developed, 23 but its results have been controversial.\\nLumbar puncture is mandatory in all patients with confirmed or suspected African trypanosomiasis. Patients with involvement of the central nervous system may have trypanosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, abnormal findings in the cerebrospinal fluid when there is confirmed peripheral infection suggests invasion of the central nervous system, even if no trypanosomes are observed. A white-cell count greater than 5 per cubic millimeter is often used to define stage 2 disease, with a sensitivity of greater than 80 percent and a specificity of about 60 percent.24 Other findings suggesting involvement of the central nervous system are elevated protein levels, high levels of IgM, or the presence of large eosinophilic plasma cells (Mott cells) in the cerebrospinal fluid. This patient's cerebrospinal fluid was normal, and he received a diagnosis of stage 1 disease. Of the 30 American travelers in the CDC series, 5 received a diagnosis of stage 2 disease. Four of them consulted a physician within five days after the onset of symptoms, but the additional time required for a correct diagnosis ranged from three days to seven weeks. Timely initiation of therapy is particularly important in patients with T. brucei rhodesiense infection in order to prevent progression of the infection. All patients who receive treatment for either type of African trypanosomiasis, regardless of the initial stage of disease, should undergo examination of cerebrospinal fluid at intervals of three to six months for two years (and at any time that symptoms recur) to rule out relapse of the infection in the central nervous system.\\nThe choice of therapy is determined by the subspecies of trypanosome and the presence or absence of involvement of the central nervous system. 25 Hemolymphatic (stage 1) T. brucei gambiense infection is generally treated with pentamidine. However, the intramuscular injections are painful and may cause sterile abscesses; other adverse effects include hypoglycemia during treatment and hypotension, particularly if the drug is given intravenously. The drug of choice for hemolymphatic T. brucei rhodesiense infection is suramin, which was administered to this patient. The most common adverse effects of suramin are fever, nephrotoxic effects, and cutaneous reactions. Anaphylaxis may occur in rare cases, but a test dose of suramin is usually administered so that such a reaction can be avoided. Peripheral parasites disappear within 12 to 36 hours after the administration of suramin; however, the penetration of the drug in the central nervous system is poor.\\nPatients with African trypanosomiasis that involves the central nervous system (stage 2 infection) are treated with melarsoprol, an organic arsenical compound. Melarsoprol is a powerful trypanocide used exclusively for late-stage infection because of its toxicity. Administration of the drug can be tricky, because the propylene glycol solvent tends to melt plastic syringes and because the solvent and the drug are intensely irritating to tissue and cause phlebitis. Cutaneous reactions, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and peripheral polyneuropathy (possibly a direct effect of the arsenic) are frequently reported. The most serious adverse effect of melarsoprol is a potentially lethal encephalopathic reaction, which complicates treatment in 2 to 10 percent of patients. 25 The reaction is thought to be immune-mediated, but the mechanism is unknown. In patients with T. brucei gambiense infection, concurrent treatment with prednisolone 26,27 reduces the incidence of encephalopathy by a factor of 3, but no comparable data exist for the use of corticosteroids in patients with T. brucei rhodesiense infection. A new, simplified dose schedule for melarsoprol based on its pharmacokinetic characteristics is under investigation as a possible replacement for the current, complicated empirical regimen.28 It appears promising for use in patients with West African trypanosomiasis, but it has not been used (and is not recommended) for those with the East African form of the disease.\\nEffective treatment of African trypanosomiasis in the future may be jeopardized by two problems. Elevated rates of treatment failure with melarsoprol have recently been observed in several geographically distinct areas where T. brucei gambiense infection is endemic.29-31 Few isolates have been tested for drug susceptibility. The cause of treatment-refractory infections has not been established, although limited data suggest that reduced sensitivity to melarsoprol may have a role.32 Although melarsoprol is the only satisfactory drug for treating T. brucei rhodesiense infection of the central nervous system, other drugs can be used to treat T. brucei gambiense infection. Eflornithine, an agent less toxic than melarsoprol, is very effective. Nifurtimox, a drug indicated for Chagas' disease, has also been used with some success33 and may be useful in combination regimens.\\nThe long-term availability of therapeutic drugs for trypanosomiasis is uncertain.34 Most of the current agents were introduced decades ago, and without a lucrative market, there has been little commercial development of new drugs. Since the 1940s, the only new drug marketed for the treatment of trypanosomiasis was eflornithine, approved in 1991. Its high cost was prohibitive for African patients, and its manufacture soon ceased. Furthermore, in recent years, continued production of the old antitrypanosomal drugs has been jeopardized because they are not profitable. Fortunately, the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture antitrypanosomal drugs have responded to requests from the World Health Organization and nongovernmental organizations to maintain production for humanitarian reasons and to donate the drugs, at least for the next few years. However, mechanisms to ensure availability in the long term have not yet been identified.\\nAvailability of these essential drugs is a critical issue, in view of the dramatic resurgence of trypanosomiasis in central Africa. 30,31,35 It is estimated that 300,000 to 500,000 persons are infected.36 In the Democratic Republic of Congo, trypanosomiasis rivals the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome as a leading cause of death. 37 Despite this public health crisis, imported cases in the United States have remained extremely rare.\\nChemoprophylaxis against African trypanosomiasis is not recommended for travelers because of the toxicity of antitrypanosomal agents and the low risk of infection. No vaccine has been developed. Avoiding tsetse-fly bites can reduce the risk of infection. The flies are attracted to bright or contrasting colors and to the dust and motion of vehicles. They can bite through thin fabric, and insect repellent provides only partial protection. As routine preventive measures, travelers should avoid known areas of tsetse-fly infestation, use insect repellent, and wear wrist- and ankle-length clothing in neutral colors.\\nDR. RYAN: As soon as the patient arrived here, we began therapy with suramin that had been obtained from the CDC. The patient received 1 g of suramin on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 after admission. Twentyfour hours after the first dose, the trypanosome load in his peripheral blood was markedly reduced, and a lumbar puncture was performed (Table 3). Examination of a sample of cerebrospinal fluid disclosed no evidence of trypanosomal involvement. The patient was very ill for the first three days. He became markedly edematous, his platelet count fell to 23,000 per cubic millimeter, and his white-cell count was 2600 per cubic millimeter. The creatinine level was 2.0 mg per deciliter (177 mmol per liter), the alanine aminotransferase level 523 U per liter, the aspartate aminotransferase level 718 U per liter, the direct bilirubin level 12.7 mg per deciliter (217 µmol per liter), and the total bilirubin level 13.1 mg per deciliter (224 μmol per liter). He was treated supportively, and his condition improved during the next four days in the hospital. He was discharged home after one week and received his last two doses of suramin as an outpatient. His chancre rapidly healed, although residual hyperpigmentation and a slight scar were evident. A lumbar puncture performed three months after presentation showed no abnormalities, and the patient has remained well. Follow-up examination of cerebrospinal fluid was scheduled to take place at intervals of 3 to 6 months for 18 to 24 months.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "{'query': \"A 37-year-old man was admitted to the Tropical and Geographic Medicine Center of this hospital because of fever and an inflamed foot.\\nThe patient had been in vigorous health three months earlier, when he and his wife began a trip around the world. Initially they traveled throughout Brazil, including the Amazonian basin, up to the border of Peru. During this portion of the trip, the patient and his wife had an episode of fever and diarrhea, all of which resolved within days. They then spent three days in Buenos Aires, Argentina, before flying to the Republic of South Africa, where they spent four weeks in Johannesburg and in Kruger National Park. The following week, they drove across Zimbabwe, where they passed through Victoria Falls National Park, and then proceeded to Zambia, where they spent two days. After visiting Nairobi, Kenya, for one day, they stayed in Tanzania for two weeks. They climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro and then proceeded to the Serengeti plain, where they both received multiple tsetse-fly bites, 11 and 10 days before the patient’s admission. They then visited Ngorongoro Crater, Arusha, and Moshi. After spending another day in Nairobi, they flew to Katmandu, Nepal, after having spent a night in Bahrain en route.\\nFour days before admission, while in Katmandu, the patient was awakened at 3 a.m. by high fever and pain in the left foot. Headache, fatigue, and severe myalgia developed, and the next day his temperature rose to 40.1°C. Dyspnea developed, his urine became darker, and the dorsum of the left foot became erythematous and tender. The next day, the temperature rose to 40.6°C, the left foot became swollen, and necrosis was observed in the center of the erythematous area. The patient was evaluated at a clinic in Katmandu. His complete blood count was normal, and two blood smears showed no evidence of malaria; the results of liver-function tests were marginally abnormal. Cephalexin (500 mg four times a day) was prescribed, but the following day the fever persisted. The white-cell count was 4000 per cubic millimeter, with 10 percent band forms; additional blood smears showed no malarial parasites. Vomiting and crampy abdominal pain developed and were accompanied by intermittent headache; pharyngitis; a diffuse, blanching, macular rash; and a temperature as high as 41.1°C. He returned to the United States and was admitted to this hospital.\\nThe patient resided in Colorado, worked in construction, and climbed mountains by avocation. He had traveled extensively in the past and reported that his hepatitis A and hepatitis B immunizations were up to date; he had had no documentation of recent vaccination against yellow fever and thus had received it again while in South Africa. He had not consulted a physician during the period immediately before the current trip and was not receiving chemoprophylaxis against malaria. He had not had typhoid vaccine in recent years and had never required rabies vaccine. He had no known allergies, and after finishing the course of cephalexin, he was taking no medications. In previous years he had undergone orthopedic surgical procedures that involved his knees and right shoulder. His medical history was otherwise unremarkable. He had been prostrate during his illness in Katmandu but had not had frank chills, visual changes, diarrhea, dysuria, arthralgia, or cognitive problems. His wife remained well.\\nThe temperature was 39.4°C, and the pulse was 85. The blood pressure was 120/60 mm Hg.\\nOn physical examination, the patient appeared dehydrated. A macular rash (Fig. 1) involved the entire trunk except for the groin and blanched with pressure. No cervical lymphadenopathy was found; tender, bilateral axillary lymph nodes, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, and a tender left femoral lymph node, 2 cm in diameter, were palpated. The conjunctivae were injected, and the sclerae were mildly icteric; the optic fundi were normal. The oropharynx was erythematous, without exudate. The lungs and heart were normal. The liver descended 3 cm below the right costal margin, and the splenic tip was palpated. The genitalia were normal. A shallow ulceration was present on the dorsum of the left foot, surrounded by a ring that contained bullae and that was, in turn, surrounded by another ring, characterized by violaceous erythema and induration; the entire lesion (Fig. 2), which was approximately 5 cm in diameter, was painful. There was no peripheral edema. Neurologic examination showed that the patient was mentally sound; the cranial-nerve functions were preserved; the sensation, muscle strength, and tendon reflexes were normal.\\nThe urine was positive for protein (+) and bilirubin (++); the sediment contained no red cells, 5 to 10 white cells, and moderate numbers of bacteria per high-power field. The abnormal laboratory values are shown in Table 1. The levels of urea nitrogen, total protein and albumin, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, glucose, uric acid, phosphorus, magnesium, creatine kinase, amylase, and lipase and the mean corpuscular volume and partial-thromboplastin time were normal. An electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities. Chest radiographs disclosed patchy opacities in the left lower lobe, a finding consistent with the presence of atelectasis or, perhaps, pneumonia; the size of the heart was normal. Orthopedic hardware consistent with a previous rotator-cuff repair was observed in the right humerus.\\nA diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDR. ANNE C. MOORE*: This case illustrates the challenges involved in evaluating a febrile traveler returning from the tropics. The patient may have been exposed to common causes of fever at home, to infectious agents present at home but more common overseas, or to pathogens endemic in tropical areas. In addition to having a complex travel history, he received no chemoprophylaxis against malaria and had not consulted a physician for pretravel medical advice or immunizations.\\nMalaria is an important diagnosis to consider. It is the most common cause of fever in patients who are hospitalized after traveling in the tropics, accounting for 32 to 42 percent of cases.1,2 The incidence of malaria depends on the area visited and the season, but it is approximately 2 percent per month among visitors to Africa who do not receive chemoprophylaxis.3 Do the negative smears for malaria before admission rule out this diagnosis? In a laboratory with experience in the diagnosis of malaria, the diagnosis in most cases is made on examination of a single thick blood smear. However, the level of parasites in the blood may be low or undetectable in nonimmune persons with early infection or in those who have taken an antimalarial drug. Another examination for malaria is advisable.\\nOther common causes of undifferentiated fever in travelers include enteric fever, which may be caused either by Salmonella typhi or by S. paratyphi, and dengue fever. The incubation period of dengue is not consistent with this patient's history of possible exposures, but enteric fever should be considered. According to the patient's itinerary and activities, his fever could also be due to borreliosis (relapsing fever), brucellosis, rickettsiosis (due to Rickettsia conorii or R. africae), African trypanosomiasis, or one of several arboviral infections.\\nA salient feature of the case is the cutaneous lesion on the patient's left foot. The most frequently seen cutaneous ulcer in travelers is a bacterial pyoderma caused by secondary infection of a minor wound or an insect bite with Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, or both pathogens. However, the patient does not have leukocytosis, and the appearance of his lesion does not suggest that it is a pyoderma. Tularemia is clinically consistent with the features of this patient's illness, but it is a disease of the Northern Hemisphere and does not occur in the areas he visited. Cutaneous anthrax is another consideration. Bacillus anthracis is found widely in Africa, and inoculation of the spores can occur at a minor abrasion of the skin or as a result of contact with contaminated animal hair or hides, soil contaminated by sick animals, or rarely, biting flies. The lesions of cutaneous anthrax are usually painless, however, and high fever is not typical.\\nThe patient's exposures and the features of the lesion suggest that the lesion is a chancre of African trypanosomiasis at the inoculation site of the pathogen. A lesion at the site of inoculation (a chagoma) is sometimes observed in patients with American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease). However, the interval between the patient's visit to areas of South America where Chagas' disease is endemic and the development of his lesion was considerably longer than the incubation period of a chagoma (which is one to two weeks).\\nThis patient is known to me because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided the drug for his treatment. The diagnostic procedure was examination of the patient's blood, in which trypanosomes were found. Trypanosomiasis in humans may be caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (in Chagas' disease) and by two subspecies of T. brucei (in African trypanosomiasis). On microscopical examination, T. cruzi can be distinguished from T. brucei; the subspecies of T. brucei, however, are morphologically identical. It is important to identify the type of African trypanosomiasis because the type of infection will guide the choice of therapy. The assignment is generally made on the basis of the history — particularly the geographic site of exposure — and the clinical features (Table 2).\\nI shall discuss this case as one of known East African trypanosomiasis. This disease is very rare in the United States. Only 30 cases have been reported since 1967, when the CDC began conducting surveillance of this infection with the use of data collected during the release of drugs for its treatment. The CDC is the sole supplier of these agents in this country. Although imported cases of African trypanosomiasis are seen infrequently, correct diagnosis is essential because the untreated infection is almost invariably fatal.\\nAfrican trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is acquired through the bites of infected tsetse flies. Transmission occurs only in the middle latitudes of Africa, where the vector is found. The infection occurs in two epidemiologically distinct forms. East African trypanosomiasis, caused by T. brucei rhodesiense, is a zoonosis and primarily affects wild animals and livestock. Sporadic cases of infection may be seen in humans (hunters, game wardens, and tourists, for instance), as can community outbreaks, in which domestic cattle serve as reservoirs.4 Humans are the only important reservoirs in the West African form of the disease, which is caused by T. brucei gambiense. Transmission of the West African infection occurs in rural, forested areas, particularly near rivers or watering spots, where humans most frequently come into contact with tsetse flies.\\nAlmost all cases of African trypanosomiasis imported by travelers returning to the United States are the East African form of the disease.5 Most patients with T. brucei rhodesiense infection reported to the CDC (27 of 30) acquired it while participating in organized photographic or hunting safaris. Between 1967 and 2000, one case of East African trypanosomiasis occurred, on average, every 1.5 years. In 2001, we observed a striking increase in the incidence of imported infection. Seven travelers from the United States and one from Canada were infected with T. brucei rhodesiense. A similar increase was observed among European travelers.6,7 Tanzania was the most common geographic site of infection.8-10 The exact number of people who travel from the United States to African game reserves is unknown, so the predominance of cases in Tanzania may reflect a large number of tourist visits there as well as a country-specific risk. Tourists rarely acquire T. brucei gambiense infection because they seldom visit the rural areas of Central and West Africa where the disease is transmitted. Since 1967, three travelers have become infected with T. brucei gambiense; however, five imported cases have been diagnosed in African nationals living in the United States.11-14\\nAfrican trypanosomiasis is characterized by the development of a lesion at the inoculation site, followed by parasitemia, hemolymphatic involvement, and eventually invasion of the central nervous system, which leads to meningoencephalitis, coma, and death. East African infection follows an acute course in which there is early involvement of the central nervous system, often within three to four weeks after inoculation. West African infection is more indolent and progresses over months to years, reflecting the adaptation of T. brucei gambiense to its reservoir host.\\nThe immune response to the infection and the pathogenesis of the disease are complex and poorly understood. Antigenic variation is one of several mechanisms used by T. brucei to evade immune destruction.15 Trypanosomes in the bloodstream are able to change the antigenic structure of their glycoprotein coat periodically by switching the antigen-encoding gene that is expressed at any given time. The host mounts a response to each successive surface antigen, but it cannot completely clear the infection before the appearance of a new subpopulation of trypanosomes. A key feature of the host response is generalized immunosuppression, which is accompanied by polyclonal activation of B cells and leads to the production of large amounts of nonspecific IgM. The resulting circulating immune complexes may have a role in the anemia, vascular permeability, and tissue damage observed in trypanosomiasis. The disease can affect most organs, but pathologic changes in the reticuloendothelial, cardiac, and nervous systems predominate.\\nThe first sign of infection is a painful chancre, which develops at the site of the tsetse-fly bite within one to two weeks after the bite. Such a chancre is observed in half the Europeans infected with T. brucei rhodesiense, but it is seldom evident in Africans infected with T. brucei gambiense.16 The chancre is typically large (2 to 5 cm in diameter) and indurated, and it may ulcerate; resolution occurs within a few weeks. During the hemolymphatic stage of the disease (stage 1), parasites enter the bloodstream, and intermittent episodes of high fever develop. In the acute, East African form of trypanosomiasis, this stage generally occurs within one to three weeks after the bite. Clinical manifestations vary greatly, but arthralgias, malaise, localized facial edema, and moderate splenomegaly are common. A characteristic macular rash is often present on the trunk. Myocarditis is observed mostly in cases of T. brucei rhodesiense infection, and cardiac involvement (arrhythmias or cardiac failure) is observed in 25 percent of infected U.S. travelers. Hematologic manifestations of the disease frequently include normocytic anemia. Thrombocytopenia is almost always present. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is an uncommon complication.17\\nInvolvement of the central nervous system (stage 2) is characterized by the development of severe headache and somnolence progressing to coma. A wide range of neurologic symptoms is manifested in West African trypanosomiasis. Patients may have changes in behavior, psychosis, tremors, ataxia, neuroendocrine disorders, and in occasional cases, focal neurologic findings or seizures. Weight loss occurs and may be marked. The acute course typical of East African infection tends to blur the distinction between the stages of infection, and patients have a narrower range of neurologic symptoms before the onset of coma than those with West African trypanosomiasis.\\nThe diagnosis of African trypanosomiasis rests on identification of the parasite. The parasite can often be found in fluid expressed from a chancre. Infection with T. brucei rhodesiense is usually confirmed by observation of trypanosomes in a Giemsa-stained blood smear or in wet blood preparations. Examination of the buffy coat increases the sensitivity of these techniques. A wet preparation of this patient's blood showing motile T. brucei rhodesiense organisms can be viewed on the CDC Web site, at http://www.dpd. cdc.gov/dpdx/html/trypanosomiasisafrican.htm.\\nDR. ROBERT E. SCULLY (Pathology): Dr. Ryan, what were your impressions when you saw this patient?\\nDR. EDWARD T. RYAN (Infectious Diseases): The diagnosis of East African trypanosomiasis was first made by the physicians and staff at the Canadian International Water and Energy Consultant Clinic in Katmandu. Because of the inavailability of effective medication in that geographic area, the patient was rapidly transferred to this hospital.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nEast African trypanosomiasis.\\nDR. ANNE C. MOORE'S DIAGNOSIS\\nEast African trypanosomiasis (Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense infection).\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDR. RYAN: We confirmed the diagnosis by examining fluid from the chancre and specimens of peripheral blood.\\nMS. MARY ANN WALDRON (Parasitology): In the parasitology laboratory, an aspirate from the wound was examined as a wet preparation, and a blood specimen was examined as thick and thin Giemsa-stained smears, buffy-coat concentrates, and direct specimens. The morphologically indistinguishable trypomastigotes of T. brucei gambiense or T. brucei rhodesiense were seen in all the specimens (two to four per highpower field) (Fig. 3). The kinetoplast (a DNA-containing organelle associated with the mitochondrion) is located close to the posterior end; a flagellum extends from the kinetoplast, forms the edge of an undulating membrane, and then extends as a free flagellum at the anterior end. The organism is 15 to 30 µm in length and 1.5 to 3.5 µm in width. A nucleus is centrally located within it.\\nDR. MOORE: Because the level of parasites in the blood is generally high in T. brucei rhodesiense infection, the diagnosis is often an accidental finding when smears are examined for malaria. In T. brucei gambiense infection, in contrast, the level of parasites in the blood is low, and they are difficult to detect. Serial examinations of blood specimens or lymph-node aspirates may be needed because the degree of parasitemia varies with time. Concentration techniques18,19 are often used. Currently, the roles of in vitro isolation20 and the polymerase chain reaction in diagnosis13,21 are undefined.\\nNo serologic test of high sensitivity and specificity is available for the diagnosis of East African trypanosomiasis. The diversity of circulating T. brucei rhodesiense genotypes and the extensive repertoire of surface glycoproteins have hampered the development of an antibody test. However, a serologic test for T. brucei rhodesiense would probably not be a diagnostic improvement, because the incubation period is short and because the identification of parasites in the blood is not difficult in most cases. There is less diversity among the variable antigens of T. brucei gambiense, and antibody tests have been developed; a simple card-agglutination test22 can be used to identify the organism in suspected cases of West African trypanosomiasis. Nonspecific reactions can occur; therefore, a seropositive test result cannot be used for definitive diagnosis. A test for parasite antigen has been developed, 23 but its results have been controversial.\\nLumbar puncture is mandatory in all patients with confirmed or suspected African trypanosomiasis. Patients with involvement of the central nervous system may have trypanosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, abnormal findings in the cerebrospinal fluid when there is confirmed peripheral infection suggests invasion of the central nervous system, even if no trypanosomes are observed. A white-cell count greater than 5 per cubic millimeter is often used to define stage 2 disease, with a sensitivity of greater than 80 percent and a specificity of about 60 percent.24 Other findings suggesting involvement of the central nervous system are elevated protein levels, high levels of IgM, or the presence of large eosinophilic plasma cells (Mott cells) in the cerebrospinal fluid. This patient's cerebrospinal fluid was normal, and he received a diagnosis of stage 1 disease. Of the 30 American travelers in the CDC series, 5 received a diagnosis of stage 2 disease. Four of them consulted a physician within five days after the onset of symptoms, but the additional time required for a correct diagnosis ranged from three days to seven weeks. Timely initiation of therapy is particularly important in patients with T. brucei rhodesiense infection in order to prevent progression of the infection. All patients who receive treatment for either type of African trypanosomiasis, regardless of the initial stage of disease, should undergo examination of cerebrospinal fluid at intervals of three to six months for two years (and at any time that symptoms recur) to rule out relapse of the infection in the central nervous system.\\nThe choice of therapy is determined by the subspecies of trypanosome and the presence or absence of involvement of the central nervous system. 25 Hemolymphatic (stage 1) T. brucei gambiense infection is generally treated with pentamidine. However, the intramuscular injections are painful and may cause sterile abscesses; other adverse effects include hypoglycemia during treatment and hypotension, particularly if the drug is given intravenously. The drug of choice for hemolymphatic T. brucei rhodesiense infection is suramin, which was administered to this patient. The most common adverse effects of suramin are fever, nephrotoxic effects, and cutaneous reactions. Anaphylaxis may occur in rare cases, but a test dose of suramin is usually administered so that such a reaction can be avoided. Peripheral parasites disappear within 12 to 36 hours after the administration of suramin; however, the penetration of the drug in the central nervous system is poor.\\nPatients with African trypanosomiasis that involves the central nervous system (stage 2 infection) are treated with melarsoprol, an organic arsenical compound. Melarsoprol is a powerful trypanocide used exclusively for late-stage infection because of its toxicity. Administration of the drug can be tricky, because the propylene glycol solvent tends to melt plastic syringes and because the solvent and the drug are intensely irritating to tissue and cause phlebitis. Cutaneous reactions, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and peripheral polyneuropathy (possibly a direct effect of the arsenic) are frequently reported. The most serious adverse effect of melarsoprol is a potentially lethal encephalopathic reaction, which complicates treatment in 2 to 10 percent of patients. 25 The reaction is thought to be immune-mediated, but the mechanism is unknown. In patients with T. brucei gambiense infection, concurrent treatment with prednisolone 26,27 reduces the incidence of encephalopathy by a factor of 3, but no comparable data exist for the use of corticosteroids in patients with T. brucei rhodesiense infection. A new, simplified dose schedule for melarsoprol based on its pharmacokinetic characteristics is under investigation as a possible replacement for the current, complicated empirical regimen.28 It appears promising for use in patients with West African trypanosomiasis, but it has not been used (and is not recommended) for those with the East African form of the disease.\\nEffective treatment of African trypanosomiasis in the future may be jeopardized by two problems. Elevated rates of treatment failure with melarsoprol have recently been observed in several geographically distinct areas where T. brucei gambiense infection is endemic.29-31 Few isolates have been tested for drug susceptibility. The cause of treatment-refractory infections has not been established, although limited data suggest that reduced sensitivity to melarsoprol may have a role.32 Although melarsoprol is the only satisfactory drug for treating T. brucei rhodesiense infection of the central nervous system, other drugs can be used to treat T. brucei gambiense infection. Eflornithine, an agent less toxic than melarsoprol, is very effective. Nifurtimox, a drug indicated for Chagas' disease, has also been used with some success33 and may be useful in combination regimens.\\nThe long-term availability of therapeutic drugs for trypanosomiasis is uncertain.34 Most of the current agents were introduced decades ago, and without a lucrative market, there has been little commercial development of new drugs. Since the 1940s, the only new drug marketed for the treatment of trypanosomiasis was eflornithine, approved in 1991. Its high cost was prohibitive for African patients, and its manufacture soon ceased. Furthermore, in recent years, continued production of the old antitrypanosomal drugs has been jeopardized because they are not profitable. Fortunately, the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture antitrypanosomal drugs have responded to requests from the World Health Organization and nongovernmental organizations to maintain production for humanitarian reasons and to donate the drugs, at least for the next few years. However, mechanisms to ensure availability in the long term have not yet been identified.\\nAvailability of these essential drugs is a critical issue, in view of the dramatic resurgence of trypanosomiasis in central Africa. 30,31,35 It is estimated that 300,000 to 500,000 persons are infected.36 In the Democratic Republic of Congo, trypanosomiasis rivals the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome as a leading cause of death. 37 Despite this public health crisis, imported cases in the United States have remained extremely rare.\\nChemoprophylaxis against African trypanosomiasis is not recommended for travelers because of the toxicity of antitrypanosomal agents and the low risk of infection. No vaccine has been developed. Avoiding tsetse-fly bites can reduce the risk of infection. The flies are attracted to bright or contrasting colors and to the dust and motion of vehicles. They can bite through thin fabric, and insect repellent provides only partial protection. As routine preventive measures, travelers should avoid known areas of tsetse-fly infestation, use insect repellent, and wear wrist- and ankle-length clothing in neutral colors.\\nDR. RYAN: As soon as the patient arrived here, we began therapy with suramin that had been obtained from the CDC. The patient received 1 g of suramin on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 after admission. Twentyfour hours after the first dose, the trypanosome load in his peripheral blood was markedly reduced, and a lumbar puncture was performed (Table 3). Examination of a sample of cerebrospinal fluid disclosed no evidence of trypanosomal involvement. The patient was very ill for the first three days. He became markedly edematous, his platelet count fell to 23,000 per cubic millimeter, and his white-cell count was 2600 per cubic millimeter. The creatinine level was 2.0 mg per deciliter (177 mmol per liter), the alanine aminotransferase level 523 U per liter, the aspartate aminotransferase level 718 U per liter, the direct bilirubin level 12.7 mg per deciliter (217 µmol per liter), and the total bilirubin level 13.1 mg per deciliter (224 μmol per liter). He was treated supportively, and his condition improved during the next four days in the hospital. He was discharged home after one week and received his last two doses of suramin as an outpatient. His chancre rapidly healed, although residual hyperpigmentation and a slight scar were evident. A lumbar puncture performed three months after presentation showed no abnormalities, and the patient has remained well. Follow-up examination of cerebrospinal fluid was scheduled to take place at intervals of 3 to 6 months for 18 to 24 months.\", 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"Based on the patient's travel history, symptoms, and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is **East African trypanosomiasis (Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense infection)**.\\n\\nHere's the reasoning:\\n\\n1.  **Information Gathering:**\\n    *   **Signs/Symptoms:** Fever, inflamed foot (chancre), headache, fatigue, myalgia, dyspnea, dark urine, erythema and tenderness of the foot, swelling, necrosis of the foot, vomiting, abdominal pain, pharyngitis, diffuse macular rash, high fever, and neurological symptoms (headache, somnolence).\\n    *   **Duration:** Symptoms developed four days before admission, with a peak fever of 40.6°C the day before admission.\\n    *   **Epidemiologic Context:** Travel to areas of East Africa (Katmandu, Tanzania, Kenya, Zimbabwe, South Africa), including the Amazonian basin and the border of Peru.

On the initial radiograph\\n(Fig. 1), there is evidence of a left-sided pleural effu-\\nsion, and there is a patchy opacity in the left lower lobe\\nthat suggests the presence of atelectasis underlying the\\neffusion. The chest radiograph obtained after thora-\\ncentesis shows a decrease in the size of the effusion,\\nbut there is a persistent opacity, probably atelectasis, in\\nthe left lower lobe; there is also a small nodule, 8 mm\\nin diameter, in the left upper lobe. On a subsequent\\nCT scan (Fig. 2), no nodule is seen, but the scan con-\\nfirms the presence of the left-sided pleural effusion.\\nIn addition, other scans reveal patchy air-space disease\\ninvolving the anterior portion of the left lower lobe\\nand the lingula, as well as some atelectasis in the left\\nlower lobe. In summary, over a period of about six\\nmonths a left-sided pleural effusion and a few nonspe-\\ncific opacities at the base of the left lung were noted\\non multiple imaging studies.\\nDR. QUINN: The first step in developing a differen-\\ntial diagnosis of a pleural effusion is to establish wheth-\\ner the effusion is a transudate or an exudate by analysis\\nof fluid obtained at thoracentesis. Transudative effu-\\nsions are caused by imbalances in the plasma osmotic\\nor hydrostatic pressures and occur in congestive heart\\nfailure, cirrhosis of the liver, and the nephrotic syn-\\ndrome. Exudative effusions are caused by impairment\\nof the lymphatic drainage of the pleural space or by\\npleural inflammation and are found in a wide range\\nof illnesses.1\\nThe features of exudative effusions may be used as\\ncriteria to distinguish them from transudative effusions\\n(Table 1). In this case, the lactate dehydrogenase level\\nof 1565 U per liter and the cholesterol level of 143 mg\\nper deciliter meet the criteria for an exudative effusion.\\nOn the basis of the patient's history, the possible caus-\\nes of an exudative effusion in this case include hy-\\npothyroidism, pulmonary embolism, asbestosis, drugs,\\ncancer, infections (including fungal infections, nocar-\\ndial infections, actinomycosis, and tuberculosis), and\\nrheumatoid pleuritis. Findings in the pleural fluid can\\nhelp one differentiate among these possible diagnoses.\\nThis patient's pleural fluid was cloudy, with high\\ncounts of red and white cells, a predominance of neu-\\ntrophils, and a low glucose level. The pH of the pleural\\nfluid was not recorded, but this information would\\nhave been helpful.\\nThe physicians caring for this patient considered the\\npossibility of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism has ob-\\nvious symptoms, and it sometimes causes a pleural ef-\\nfusion.2 However, in that circumstance the pleural-\\nfluid glucose level is not low, as it was in this case.\\nFurthermore, this patient's free thyroxine and triiodo-\\nthyronine levels were normal, making hypothyroidism\\nan unlikely cause of the effusion.\\nPulmonary embolism is also a consideration. Pleu-\\nral effusions in cases of pulmonary embolism are usu-\\nally small and unilateral and are often bloody, with\\nmore than 10,000 red cells per cubic millimeter. The\\nnumber of white cells is variable, with a predominance\\nof either neutrophils or lymphocytes.3 In this case, a\\nventilation-perfusion lung scan showed a low proba-\\nbility of pulmonary embolism; in addition, the result\\nof a D-dimer test was normal, although the technique\\nfor measuring the D-dimer is not reported. This pa-\\ntient had no known risk factors for pulmonary embo-\\nlism, so other diagnoses seem more likely.\\nINDICATOR\\nTABLE 1.

The glucose\\nlevel in the pleural fluid in persons with this type of\\neffusion equals the serum glucose level,¹ and the ef-\\nfusion can persist for several months.5 Considering\\nthis patient's low glucose level, her high cell counts,\\nthe absence of eosinophilia, and the absence of known\\nexposure to asbestos, a diagnosis of benign asbestos-\\nrelated pleural effusion seems unlikely.\\nSeveral medications have been shown to cause drug-\\ninduced pleural effusions, including procainamide (as-\\nsociated with a lupus-like reaction), nitrofurantoin,\\ndantrolene, methysergide, procarbazine, methotrexate,\\nbromocriptine, practolol, amiodarone, mitomycin, ble-\\nomycin, and minoxidil.¹ This patient had been treated\\nwith methotrexate for her rheumatoid arthritis, but\\nshe had discontinued it six months before the current\\nadmission because of shortness of breath. In a series\\nof 45 patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis with\\nmethotrexate for three years, there were no reports of\\npleural effusions. Most reported cases of pleural effu-\\nsion during methotrexate therapy involve patients be-\\ning treated for a malignant tumor.7,8 The effusion in\\nthis case persisted, even though the patient had not\\nbeen treated with methotrexate for six months, and\\ntherefore methotrexate appears to be an unlikely cause.\\nThis patient had also been treated with etanercept, an\\ninhibitor of tumor necrosis factor that has not been as-\\nsociated with the development of pleural effusions.9\\nBecause this patient had a 30-pack-year history of\\nsmoking, it is possible that the effusion was due to\\ncancer. A pleural effusion may be the first sign of can-\\ncer, in which case the most common sites of the pri-\\nmary tumor are the lung and the breast. The effusions\\ntend to range from moderate to massive, with 90 per-\\ncent larger than 500 ml and 59 percent larger than\\n1000 ml. They can be unilateral or bilateral.10 The\\ncharacteristics of the pleural fluid in these cases are\\nnonspecific, although a low pH and a low glucose lev-\\nel has been associated with shorter survival. 10,11 This\\npatient had had a small, persistent effusion for six\\nmonths, and at the time of admission she had no\\nsymptoms such as hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea,\\ncough, bone pain, or weight loss that would suggest\\nthe presence of a malignant tumor.\\nThe patient had been taking prednisone daily for\\nan unknown length of time and had previously taken\\nmethotrexate. Infections due to immunosuppression\\nand pleural effusion, such as actinomycosis, nocardial\\ninfection, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, and histoplas-\\nmosis, are therefore diagnostic possibilities.6,12-15 Par-\\nasitic infections, bacterial infections with parapneu-\\n846 N Engl J Med, Vol. 346, No. 11 March 14, 2002 www.nejm.org\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

On phys-\\nical examination, she had prominent rheumatoid de-\\nformities involving the hands, ankles, and knees.\\nSeveral extraarticular features of rheumatoid arthritis\\nmay involve the lung; they include pulmonary fibrosis,\\nupper-lobe fibrobullous disease, necrobiotic nodules,\\npulmonary hypertension, Caplan's syndrome, bronchi-\\nolitis obliterans, follicular bronchiolitis, and pleural ef-\\nfusion.12 Pulmonary manifestations may precede or\\nfollow the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.25 Pleural\\neffusion, which may recur more than 10 years after\\nthe diagnosis, 25 has been found to be one of the most\\nfrequent manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis in the\\nlung; the incidence varies from 2 to 52 percent.25\\nPleural effusion in cases of rheumatoid arthritis has\\na striking male predominance, in contrast to pleural\\neffusion in articular rheumatoid arthritis, which has a\\nfemale predominance.25 Seventy-one to 95 percent of\\nrheumatoid effusions occur in men.25-27 The average\\nage of patients with rheumatoid effusions is 51 to 57\\nyears,25,26,28,29 and more than 50 percent of patients\\nare over the age of 50.26 This type of effusion is usu-\\nally unilateral 26,27 but has been reported to occur bi-\\nlaterally,27 and the pleural fluid is usually yellow-green\\nbut may be turbid, opaque, clear, straw-colored, or\\nbloody. 26,27,30 Rheumatoid effusions can resolve in\\nthree to four weeks, but characteristically they persist\\nfor several months or years. 25,27\\nSeveral laboratory findings are characteristic of pleu-\\nral fluid in patients with rheumatoid effusions. Pleural-\\nfluid glucose levels are less than 30 mg per deciliter\\n(1.7 mmol per liter) in 66 percent of rheumatoid ef-\\nfusions and less than 50 mg per deciliter (2.8 mmol\\nper liter) in 80 percent.26 When the effusion is per-\\nsistent, the glucose level decreases over time.31 The\\npH of the pleural fluid is generally 7.00 to 7.13.28,31\\nA low pleural-fluid glucose level and a low pleural-\\nfluid pH are not specific to rheumatoid arthritis; they\\nare also found in cases of empyema, tuberculosis, and\\nmalignant tumors. 10,28,32 The low glucose levels appear\\nto be caused by blockage of the transfer of glucose\\nfrom the blood to the pleura, 1,27 and the low pH re-\\nsults from the metabolism of glucose and the accumu-\\nlation of lactate and carbon dioxide. 32 The white-cell\\ncounts in rheumatoid effusions are variable: during the\\nacute phase there is a predominance of neutrophils,\\nbut in the chronic phase there is a predominance of\\nlymphocytes. 31 The rheumatoid factor in the pleural\\nfluid is characteristically greater than 1:320,29 but high\\nlevels of rheumatoid factor in the pleural fluid are also\\nfound in cases of bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis,\\nand carcinoma.¹ The combination of a low pH, a low\\nglucose level, and a low C4 level in the pleural fluid\\nis a good indicator of the presence of rheumatoid ef-\\nfusion. 28 Rheumatoid factor and complement levels\\nwere not measured in this case.\\nFor a variety of reasons\\nthe persistence of the\\npleural effusion; the low pleural-fluid glucose level; the\\nhigh levels of lactate dehydrogenase and cholesterol;\\nthe absence of evidence of pleural thickening, hilar or\\nmediastinal lymphadenopathy, or other important pa-\\nrenchymal changes on the CT scans; and the absence\\nof fever, cough, chest pain, weight loss, bone pain, and\\ndyspnea at the time of diagnosis I believe that the\\nprobable cause of the pleural effusion is rheumatoid\\narthritis.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nPleural effusion with a parapneumonic, malignant,\\nor rheumatoid cause.\\nDR.

She had otherwise been well\\nuntil six months before admission, when she entered\\nanother hospital because of pleuritic left-sided chest\\npain. Analysis of a specimen of arterial blood obtained\\nwhile the patient was breathing ambient air revealed\\nthat the partial pressure of oxygen was 66 mm Hg, the\\npartial pressure of carbon dioxide 24 mm Hg, and the\\npH 7.46.

The prothrombin\\ntime, partial-thromboplastin time, and D-dimer value\\nwere normal. The glucose level was 115 mg per deci-\\nliter (6.4 mmol per liter), and the albumin level was\\n3.3 g per deciliter.

On the initial radiograph\\n(Fig. 1), there is evidence of a left-sided pleural effu-\\nsion, and there is a patchy opacity in the left lower lobe\\nthat suggests the presence of atelectasis underlying the\\neffusion. The chest radiograph obtained after thora-\\ncentesis shows a decrease in the size of the effusion,\\nbut there is a persistent opacity, probably atelectasis, in\\nthe left lower lobe; there is also a small nodule, 8 mm\\nin diameter, in the left upper lobe. On a subsequent\\nCT scan (Fig. 2), no nodule is seen, but the scan con-\\nfirms the presence of the left-sided pleural effusion.\\nIn addition, other scans reveal patchy air-space disease\\ninvolving the anterior portion of the left lower lobe\\nand the lingula, as well as some atelectasis in the left\\nlower lobe. In summary, over a period of about six\\nmonths a left-sided pleural effusion and a few nonspe-\\ncific opacities at the base of the left lung were noted\\non multiple imaging studies.\\nDR. QUINN: The first step in developing a differen-\\ntial diagnosis of a pleural effusion is to establish wheth-\\ner the effusion is a transudate or an exudate by analysis\\nof fluid obtained at thoracentesis. Transudative effu-\\nsions are caused by imbalances in the plasma osmotic\\nor hydrostatic pressures and occur in congestive heart\\nfailure, cirrhosis of the liver, and the nephrotic syn-\\ndrome. Exudative effusions are caused by impairment\\nof the lymphatic drainage of the pleural space or by\\npleural inflammation and are found in a wide range\\nof illnesses.1\\nThe features of exudative effusions may be used as\\ncriteria to distinguish them from transudative effusions\\n(Table 1). In this case, the lactate dehydrogenase level\\nof 1565 U per liter and the cholesterol level of 143 mg\\nper deciliter meet the criteria for an exudative effusion.\\nOn the basis of the patient's history, the possible caus-\\nes of an exudative effusion in this case include hy-\\npothyroidism, pulmonary embolism, asbestosis, drugs,\\ncancer, infections (including fungal infections, nocar-\\ndial infections, actinomycosis, and tuberculosis), and\\nrheumatoid pleuritis. Findings in the pleural fluid can\\nhelp one differentiate among these possible diagnoses.\\nThis patient's pleural fluid was cloudy, with high\\ncounts of red and white cells, a predominance of neu-\\ntrophils, and a low glucose level. The pH of the pleural\\nfluid was not recorded, but this information would\\nhave been helpful.\\nThe physicians caring for this patient considered the\\npossibility of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism has ob-\\nvious symptoms, and it sometimes causes a pleural ef-\\nfusion.2 However, in that circumstance the pleural-\\nfluid glucose level is not low, as it was in this case.\\nFurthermore, this patient's free thyroxine and triiodo-\\nthyronine levels were normal, making hypothyroidism\\nan unlikely cause of the effusion.\\nPulmonary embolism is also a consideration. Pleu-\\nral effusions in cases of pulmonary embolism are usu-\\nally small and unilateral and are often bloody, with\\nmore than 10,000 red cells per cubic millimeter. The\\nnumber of white cells is variable, with a predominance\\nof either neutrophils or lymphocytes.3 In this case, a\\nventilation-perfusion lung scan showed a low proba-\\nbility of pulmonary embolism; in addition, the result\\nof a D-dimer test was normal, although the technique\\nfor measuring the D-dimer is not reported. This pa-\\ntient had no known risk factors for pulmonary embo-\\nlism, so other diagnoses seem more likely.\\nINDICATOR\\nTABLE 1.

The glucose\\nlevel in the pleural fluid in persons with this type of\\neffusion equals the serum glucose level,¹ and the ef-\\nfusion can persist for several months.5 Considering\\nthis patient's low glucose level, her high cell counts,\\nthe absence of eosinophilia, and the absence of known\\nexposure to asbestos, a diagnosis of benign asbestos-\\nrelated pleural effusion seems unlikely.\\nSeveral medications have been shown to cause drug-\\ninduced pleural effusions, including procainamide (as-\\nsociated with a lupus-like reaction), nitrofurantoin,\\ndantrolene, methysergide, procarbazine, methotrexate,\\nbromocriptine, practolol, amiodarone, mitomycin, ble-\\nomycin, and minoxidil.¹ This patient had been treated\\nwith methotrexate for her rheumatoid arthritis, but\\nshe had discontinued it six months before the current\\nadmission because of shortness of breath. In a series\\nof 45 patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis with\\nmethotrexate for three years, there were no reports of\\npleural effusions. Most reported cases of pleural effu-\\nsion during methotrexate therapy involve patients be-\\ning treated for a malignant tumor.7,8 The effusion in\\nthis case persisted, even though the patient had not\\nbeen treated with methotrexate for six months, and\\ntherefore methotrexate appears to be an unlikely cause.\\nThis patient had also been treated with etanercept, an\\ninhibitor of tumor necrosis factor that has not been as-\\nsociated with the development of pleural effusions.9\\nBecause this patient had a 30-pack-year history of\\nsmoking, it is possible that the effusion was due to\\ncancer. A pleural effusion may be the first sign of can-\\ncer, in which case the most common sites of the pri-\\nmary tumor are the lung and the breast. The effusions\\ntend to range from moderate to massive, with 90 per-\\ncent larger than 500 ml and 59 percent larger than\\n1000 ml. They can be unilateral or bilateral.10 The\\ncharacteristics of the pleural fluid in these cases are\\nnonspecific, although a low pH and a low glucose lev-\\nel has been associated with shorter survival. 10,11 This\\npatient had had a small, persistent effusion for six\\nmonths, and at the time of admission she had no\\nsymptoms such as hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea,\\ncough, bone pain, or weight loss that would suggest\\nthe presence of a malignant tumor.\\nThe patient had been taking prednisone daily for\\nan unknown length of time and had previously taken\\nmethotrexate. Infections due to immunosuppression\\nand pleural effusion, such as actinomycosis, nocardial\\ninfection, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, and histoplas-\\nmosis, are therefore diagnostic possibilities.6,12-15 Par-\\nasitic infections, bacterial infections with parapneu-\\n846 N Engl J Med, Vol. 346, No. 11 March 14, 2002 www.nejm.org\\nThe New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.\\nDownloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

On phys-\\nical examination, she had prominent rheumatoid de-\\nformities involving the hands, ankles, and knees.\\nSeveral extraarticular features of rheumatoid arthritis\\nmay involve the lung; they include pulmonary fibrosis,\\nupper-lobe fibrobullous disease, necrobiotic nodules,\\npulmonary hypertension, Caplan's syndrome, bronchi-\\nolitis obliterans, follicular bronchiolitis, and pleural ef-\\nfusion.12 Pulmonary manifestations may precede or\\nfollow the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.25 Pleural\\neffusion, which may recur more than 10 years after\\nthe diagnosis, 25 has been found to be one of the most\\nfrequent manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis in the\\nlung; the incidence varies from 2 to 52 percent.25\\nPleural effusion in cases of rheumatoid arthritis has\\na striking male predominance, in contrast to pleural\\neffusion in articular rheumatoid arthritis, which has a\\nfemale predominance.25 Seventy-one to 95 percent of\\nrheumatoid effusions occur in men.25-27 The average\\nage of patients with rheumatoid effusions is 51 to 57\\nyears,25,26,28,29 and more than 50 percent of patients\\nare over the age of 50.26 This type of effusion is usu-\\nally unilateral 26,27 but has been reported to occur bi-\\nlaterally,27 and the pleural fluid is usually yellow-green\\nbut may be turbid, opaque, clear, straw-colored, or\\nbloody. 26,27,30 Rheumatoid effusions can resolve in\\nthree to four weeks, but characteristically they persist\\nfor several months or years. 25,27\\nSeveral laboratory findings are characteristic of pleu-\\nral fluid in patients with rheumatoid effusions. Pleural-\\nfluid glucose levels are less than 30 mg per deciliter\\n(1.7 mmol per liter) in 66 percent of rheumatoid ef-\\nfusions and less than 50 mg per deciliter (2.8 mmol\\nper liter) in 80 percent.26 When the effusion is per-\\nsistent, the glucose level decreases over time.31 The\\npH of the pleural fluid is generally 7.00 to 7.13.28,31\\nA low pleural-fluid glucose level and a low pleural-\\nfluid pH are not specific to rheumatoid arthritis; they\\nare also found in cases of empyema, tuberculosis, and\\nmalignant tumors. 10,28,32 The low glucose levels appear\\nto be caused by blockage of the transfer of glucose\\nfrom the blood to the pleura, 1,27 and the low pH re-\\nsults from the metabolism of glucose and the accumu-\\nlation of lactate and carbon dioxide. 32 The white-cell\\ncounts in rheumatoid effusions are variable: during the\\nacute phase there is a predominance of neutrophils,\\nbut in the chronic phase there is a predominance of\\nlymphocytes. 31 The rheumatoid factor in the pleural\\nfluid is characteristically greater than 1:320,29 but high\\nlevels of rheumatoid factor in the pleural fluid are also\\nfound in cases of bacterial pneumonia, tuberculosis,\\nand carcinoma.¹ The combination of a low pH, a low\\nglucose level, and a low C4 level in the pleural fluid\\nis a good indicator of the presence of rheumatoid ef-\\nfusion. 28 Rheumatoid factor and complement levels\\nwere not measured in this case.\\nFor a variety of reasons\\nthe persistence of the\\npleural effusion; the low pleural-fluid glucose level; the\\nhigh levels of lactate dehydrogenase and cholesterol;\\nthe absence of evidence of pleural thickening, hilar or\\nmediastinal lymphadenopathy, or other important pa-\\nrenchymal changes on the CT scans; and the absence\\nof fever, cough, chest pain, weight loss, bone pain, and\\ndyspnea at the time of diagnosis I believe that the\\nprobable cause of the pleural effusion is rheumatoid\\narthritis.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nPleural effusion with a parapneumonic, malignant,\\nor rheumatoid cause.\\nDR.

Be concise and grounded.\\n\\n# PATIENT CASE\\nAn 11-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of fevers and pulmonary infiltrates. One month before admission, a month after beginning a visit to India with his parents, daily fevers, with temperatures up to 38.9°C, developed, without localizing signs or symptoms. Before the family left for India, the boy's primary care physician gave him one dose of immunoglobulin intramuscularly for hepatitis A prophylaxis and prescribed mefloquine weekly for malaria prophylaxis. He was evaluated at an Indian health care facility, and amoxicillin-clavulanate was administered, but there was no improvement. On the sixth day after the onset of fevers, mefloquine was stopped and chloroquine was administered for 3 days, followed by ciprofloxacin for 3 days. Fever persisted, and a nonproductive cough developed.\\nNineteen days before his admission to this hospital, the patient was admitted to a hospital in India. His blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg and his pulse 138 beats per minute; although he had been febrile, his temperature was normal. Hepatosplenomegaly was noted, but the results of the remainder of the examination were normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. No parasites were seen on examination of a peripheral-blood smear, and a test for serum antibodies to Salmonella typhi was negative. A chest radiograph showed an irregular perihilar parenchymal opacity with air bronchograms and multiple smaller air-space opacities in the left perihilar region. Ampicillin-sulbactam and amikacin were administered intravenously. A tuberculin skin test showed no induration after 48 hours, and the temperature, which had been fluctuating, returned to normal on the fifth hospital day. Intravenous fluid being infused through a catheter inserted in the dorsum of the right distal forearm infiltrated into the tissue, and an adhesive bandage was applied over the site. The patient was discharged on the sixth hospital day, receiving oral amoxicillin-clavulanate and clarithromycin, and his cough gradually resolved. Nine days after discharge, and 5 days before admission to this hospital, he returned to the United States.\\nTwo days after his return to the United States, his temperature rose to 39°C, and fever recurred daily thereafter. The amoxicillin-clavulanate was stopped after completion of the course of therapy; the day before admission to this hospital, the clarithromycin was completed. On the day of admission, he was evaluated at the office of his primary care physician; his temperature was 38.7°C. An erythematous nodule, 15 to 18 mm in diameter, was present on the dorsum of the right distal forearm, at the site of the previous venipuncture. There were no other localizing signs or symptoms. A chest radiograph showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. A biopsy of the nodule on the forearm was performed, and specimens were sent for culture and pathological examination. The patient was referred to this hospital for admission.\\nThe patient was born in the United States after a full-term gestation to a primigravid mother; delivery was by cesarean section because of cephalopelvic disproportion. At birth, the patient's weight was 3.075 kg (21st percentile) and his length 53.3 cm (90th percentile). At 6 weeks of age, he had been admitted to another hospital for a self-limited episode of fever and poor feeding. A palpable spleen tip was noted on examination, and ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed that the spleen was 6.2 cm in length, the upper limit of normal for his age. A culture of the blood was sterile; his temperature returned to normal and he was discharged. Follow-up ultrasonography of the abdomen 1 month after discharge was normal. Routine immunizations were given, and developmental milestones and growth parameters were normal. At 6 months of age, his weight was 7.1 kg (18th percentile) and length 71 cm (92nd percentile). While in India, the patient and his parents had stayed with relatives in an urban area, and the patient had close contact with many people, including a relative with pulmonary tuberculosis who was receiving triple-drug therapy. There were no exposures to animals. The patient had no allergies to medications, and in the United States he lived with his parents and did not attend day care. His parents were professionals who had emigrated from India. There was no family history of recurrent febrile illnesses, rheumatologic diseases, or immunodeficiency.\\nOn examination, he appeared well — he was playful and breathing comfortably. His weight was 8.2 kg (3rd percentile), temperature 39.3°C, pulse 140 beats per minute, respiratory rate 42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% while breathing ambient air. A well-circumscribed area of erythema and induration, 1 cm by 2 cm, was present on the dorsum of the right forearm, and the incision from the biopsy was clean and dry. The lungs were clear, and the results of the remainder of the physical examination were normal. Levels of serum electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the test results for renal and liver function; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Tests of nasal secretions for antigens of adenovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed nodular areas of consolidation throughout both lungs, some with calcification. The larger opacities were in the upper lobes, up to 2.6 cm by 1.7 cm by 1.9 cm. Some were contiguous with the hila and extended to the pleural surface. Soft-tissue fullness in the mediastinum, hila, and left axilla suggested lymphadenopathy. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were administered orally and ceftriaxone intravenously.\\nOn the second hospital day, the temperature rose to 39.7°C. A tuberculin skin test was performed, and an aspirate of gastric secretions obtained in the early morning was sent for acidfast staining and mycobacterial culture. Isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and rifampin were begun. Analysis of a urine specimen was normal, and a culture of the urine specimen, collected in an external bag, grew few mixed flora. Specimens of stool were sent for culture of enteric pathogens, presence of Clostridium difficile toxin, and ova and parasitologic analysis.\\nDuring the next 3 days, two additional earlymorning specimens of gastric aspirate were obtained; staining did not reveal acid-fast bacilli and cultures were pending. On the fourth hospital day, the temperature rose to 40°C and the patient vomited intermittently, occasionally after episodes of coughing productive of white sputum. The site of the tuberculin skin test showed no induration. The next day, the temperature fluctuated between 34.6 and 40.1°C. Serum IgG antibodies to cytomegalovirus were present; test results for Epstein-Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus antibodies in the serum and legionella and histoplasma urine antigens were negative. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Additional specimens of blood were sent for culture; results of other tests were pending. A review of the slides from the skin biopsy that had been performed earlier revealed scattered nuclear debris and rare structures suggestive of fungal hyphae; in deeper sections stained for organisms, these structures were no longer visible. Ceftriaxone was stopped and meropenem and liposomal amphotericin were administered intravenously.\\nOn the sixth hospital day, emesis was tinged with blood, and a sample of stool was guaiacpositive. The respiratory rate transiently increased to 66 to 75 breaths per minute, with oxygen saturations between 98 and 100%, then returned to 32 to 44 breaths per minute. The temperature ranged from 33.9 to 39.6°C. Additional chest radiography continued to show bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. A diagnostic procedure was performed on the seventh hospital day.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDr. Jason B. Harris: May we review the radiologic studies?\\nDr. Sjirk J. Westra: CT of the chest, performed on admission without the administration of contrast material, showed several ill-defined nodules in the posterior lung zones, several of which contained calcifications; the nodules blended with the pulmonary hila (Fig. 1A), and some extended to the pleura. One week later, CT of the chest performed with the administration of intravenous contrast material showed fullness of the soft tissues in the mediastinum, which could be explained by the normal thymus, and mild prominence of the hilar lymph nodes. The tracheobronchial tree was normally patent. Large nodules were present, predominantly in the upper lobes of the lungs, with ill-defined and spiculated margins, which was probably indicative of inflammation; the larger nodules were calcified (Fig. 1B). A chest radiograph taken 5 days later (Fig. 1C) showed ill-defined nodular infiltrates, predominantly in the middle- and upper-lung zones, and ill-defined hilar markings.\\nThe differential diagnosis of bilateral nodular pulmonary consolidation with calcifications includes granulomatous infection, particularly tuberculosis. However, calcification does not occur in primary tuberculosis, and postprimary tuberculosis would be unusual in this young child. Chronic fungal infections frequently calcify, whereas bacterial and pneumocystic infections are not usually associated with calcification. Given the clinical presentation and the appearance of these nodules, a calcifying neoplastic process, such as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (inflammatory pseudotumor) or a metastatic malignant tumor, was believed to be less likely than an infection.\\nDr. Harris: I participated in the care of this patient and am aware of the diagnosis. Fever and a cough developed in this infant during travel in India, and they recurred despite antibiotic therapy. On admission, his weight gain had slowed. Imaging studies showed a chronic multinodular pneumonia with calcification. Our differential diagnosis included infectious and noninfectious conditions, and we considered the possibility that his condition might be a manifestation of primary immunodeficiency.\\nINFECTION WITH MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS\\nThis patient's young age and close contact with an adult with pulmonary tuberculosis suggested a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, the most common cause of chronic pneumonia in the world, with approximately 2 million cases per year in India.¹ Infants younger than 1 year of age who are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis are at extremely high risk for the development of active disease, estimated to approach 40% in the first 2 years of life as compared with a 5 to 10% cumulative lifetime risk of disease in immunocompetent adults.² Does this patient's clinical presentation support the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis?\\nFirst, is the incubation period consistent with tuberculosis? This child's symptoms developed 1 month after arriving in India. Infants, unlike older children or adults, often present with symptomatic primary tuberculosis 3 to 8 weeks after exposure, and disseminated disease, such as miliary or meningeal tuberculosis, may develop 2 to 6 months after exposure.³ Are the other clinical characteristics of the patient's illness consistent with tuberculosis? Although infants are more likely than adults to present with extrapulmonary disease, the majority of infants diagnosed with tuberculosis in the United States do in fact have isolated pulmonary disease.⁴ They typically present with nonproductive cough and fever, as this patient did. The erythematous cutaneous nodule at the site of an intravenous catheter could be a cutaneous manifestation of tuberculosis, although this would be unusual. However, the nodule might have resulted from an unrelated infection, and it appeared to be resolving at the time of admission. A transient response to amikacin may also be seen in M. tuberculosis infection. Are the radiographic findings consistent with tuberculosis? Parenchymal lung disease and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are characteristic of pulmonary tuberculosis in infants. Often there is a primary complex, consisting of a parenchymal lesion with associated lymphadenitis. Although miliary involvement can occur in congenital tuberculosis, the presence of multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, some with calcification, suggesting multifocal granulomatous inflammation, is atypical.\\nFinally, what can we learn from the diagnostic studies that were obtained in the first few days of the patient's hospitalization? Acid-fast bacilli stains of early-morning gastric aspirates are often negative in children with pulmonary tuberculosis and have little negative predictive value; however, cultures will be positive in up to 70% of infants with pulmonary tuberculosis.⁴ This patient also had a negative response to a purified-protein-derivative (PPD) skin test for tuberculosis. Although the majority of infants with disseminated tuberculosis initially have a negative response to this test, 80 to 90% of immunocompetent infants with isolated pulmonary tuberculosis test positive.⁴,⁵ Although not definitive, the negative result on the PPD skin test suggests that this patient either did not have tuberculosis or was immunocompromised. Although we were concerned enough to treat this patient empirically for possible tuberculosis, we considered other infectious and noninfectious causes of his illness.\\nOTHER CAUSES OF CHRONIC MULTINODULAR PNEUMONIA\\nHistoplasmosis is endemic in India and in the United States and can mimic tuberculosis. It can manifest as a primary pulmonary infection, though infants are predisposed to progressive reticuloendothelial infection characterized by fever, failure to thrive, and hepatosplenomegaly. In this case, a urine antigen test was negative. Blastomyces and cryptococcus are also found in India and can cause chronic pneumonia and cutaneous manifestations, including isolated skin nodules and ulcers. However, these infections rarely result in calcified lung lesions. Aspergillus species are an important cause of nodular pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts, particularly patients with hematologic malignancies, neutropenia, or phagocyte disorders, and chronic infections may calcify. Thus, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis due to an underlying immunodeficiency was a consideration, despite the fact that this child had been healthy for the first 10 months of life.\\nNontuberculous mycobacteria need to be considered, especially in view of the negative finding on the PPD skin test and the partial clinical response to amikacin, which is active against nontuberculous mycobacteria. However, pulmonary infection of this magnitude with nontuberculous mycobacteria is rare in a healthy host, and symptoms recurred on use of clarithromycin, which is highly active against most nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is endemic in India and can manifest as a chronic, multinodular pneumonia. Skin manifestations, including ulcers and abscesses, can occur in isolation or as part of disseminated disease; thus, melioidosis was a possible diagnosis in this case. Rhodococcus equi is an increasingly recognized cause of chronic nodular pneumonia in immunocompromised patients; however, infection with R. equi is typically associated with exposures to animals or soil, neither of which was present in this case. Nocardia species can cause chronic lung infections, including multinodular pneumonia, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Paragonimus, a lung fluke that is endemic in India, can present as chronic pneumonia with multiple calcified nodules; however, most patients have peripheral blood eosinophilia and a history of shellfish exposure, neither of which applied in this case.\\nSarcoidosis is a chronic pulmonary granulomatous disease; however, the infantile form, Blau syndrome, does not typically involve the lungs. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (also known as inflammatory pseudotumor or plasma-cell granuloma), the most common primary lung tumor in children, is often associated with calcification.⁶ However, most of these tumors are solitary lung lesions and are not associated with fever. Metastatic Wilms' tumor or neuroblastoma can occur at this age, but there is no evidence of a primary tumor in the abdomen.\\nCHRONIC MULTINODULAR PNEUMONIA AS A MANIFESTATION OF PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCY\\nAn early concern was that the patient had a primary immunodeficiency. Primary immunodeficiency disorders are typically suspected in the presence of repeated infections, opportunistic infections, failure to thrive, a positive family history for such a disorder, hematologic abnormalities, abnormal responses to common infections, or characteristic features of a syndrome associated with immunodeficiency, such as DiGeorge's syndrome, which is distinguished by cleft palate, endocrine abnormalities, and congenital heart defects. Because many immunodeficiency syndromes can present after 6 months of age, the fact that this child had thrived in early infancy does not exclude such a diagnosis. Although we had not documented the presence of an opportunistic infection, the finding of multiple calcified pulmonary nodules suggested that a chronic granulomatous process preceded the visit to India and the development of symptoms. This could represent an abnormal response to infection — a characteristic feature of chronic granulomatous disease.\\nChronic granulomatous disease, which is due to a primary defect of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase pathway, is one of the most common serious primary immunodeficiency syndromes, with an incidence of at least 1 in 200,000 births in the United States.⁷ The clinical manifestations are listed in Table 2. Pulmonary infection occurs in more than 80% of cases, particularly in a form of calcifying multinodular pneumonia known as encapsulating pneumonia.⁷,⁸ Another common clinical manifestation is the formation of relatively painless subcutaneous nodules, known as cold abscesses, which are a classic manifestation of phagocytic dysfunction. This patient's lung and skin lesions are thus highly characteristic of chronic granulomatous disease.\\nThe diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease is often suggested by a microbiologic diagnosis, since the majority of infections in this disease are due to five catalase-producing microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, B. cepacia, Serratia marcescens, nocardia species, and aspergillus species. Aspergillus is the predominant causative agent of pulmonary infections, accounting for more than 40% of cases in which a causative organism is identified.⁷ Aspergillus and B. cepacia account for many of the deaths in patients with chronic granulomatous disease.⁷\\nDuring the course of our patient's treatment at this hospital, additional information was obtained that increased our concern for chronic granulomatous disease. Although there was no family history of immunodeficiency, we learned that the patient's parents were closely related. Consanguinity greatly increases the likelihood of an autosomal recessive disorder. In addition, the skin biopsy was interpreted as showing a possible fungal hypha, which heightened our suspicion that the patient had chronic granulomatous disease.\\nOther causes of primary immunodeficiency are much less likely. Cystic fibrosis and ciliary defects are associated with chronic sinopulmonary disease, but they are usually associated with bronchiectasis. T-cell and B-cell immunodeficiencies can present with pneumonia, but in this case the normal immunoglobulin levels, the lack of lymphopenia, and the lack of prior recurrent infections or chronic diarrhea argue against these immunodeficiencies. Other phagocytic disorders include deficiencies in the interferon-γ-interleukin-12 receptor signaling pathway. Like chronic granulomatous disease, these disorders are associated with a remarkably specific microbiology — typically mycobacterial infections or nontyphoid salmonellosis. However, these disorders are much less common than chronic granulomatous disease.\\nDIAGNOSTIC TESTING\\nTo evaluate for chronic granulomatous disease, on the fourth hospital day we sent peripheralblood leukocytes from this patient to another laboratory for an oxidative burst assay. While this result was pending, we obtained a specimen from the involved lung tissue for histopathology and culture, which we considered essential to establishing a diagnosis.\\nDR. JASON B. HARRIS'S DIAGNOSIS\\nInfectious pneumonia, probably due to aspergillus species and probably complicating chronic granulomatous disease.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDr. Richard L. Kradin: Pathological examination of a video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy specimen of the right upper lobe of the lung revealed necrotizing granulomas, primarily centered on small airways (Fig. 2A), with extensive necrosis and dystrophic calcifications (Fig. 2B). Special stains were negative for mycobacteria, but Gomori's methenamine silver staining (Fig. 2C) revealed fragmented, varicose, septate hyphae with rare orthogonal pyriform conidia in areas of necrosis. The presence of fragmented varicose hyphae with small, lateral, pyriform conidiophores and conidia in tissue are typical of aspergillus of the flavipes-terreus group.¹⁰ A hyphal form was highlighted by immunohistochemical staining for aspergillus species. Cultures of the specimen showed no growth of fungi or bacteria, but a culture of the skin-biopsy specimen that had been obtained before admission grew Aspergillus terreus. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease are most commonly infected with A. fumigatus or A. nidulans.¹¹ A. terreus is a ubiquitous environmental fungus, which is emerging as an important pathogen in pulmonary infections in immunocompromised hosts.¹²,¹³\\nThe host response to aspergillus in this case mimics that of a mycobacterial or fungal yeast infection. Whereas invasive infections due to aspergillus species are well recognized in chronic granulomatous disease, well-defined necrotizing granulomatous inflammation is infrequent. As there was no evidence of angioinvasion in the sampled lung tissue, the infection is best classified as invasive chronic necrotizing aspergillosis, which is distinguished specifically by the absence of vascular invasion.\\nDr. Ian C. Michelow: The dihydrorhodamine assay, a quantitative measure of NADPH oxidase function during the respiratory burst of phagocytic cells, is the diagnostic test for chronic granulomatous disease. Chronic granulomatous disease is caused by mutations in genes that encode for one or more of the six components of the NADPH oxidase complex, an enzyme that is present in phagocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages and is critical to the production of the reactive oxygen species that help eradicate organisms that have been subject to phagocytosis. In our patient, the assay (Fig. 3) showed a broad peak of fluorescence that was lower than that of normal neutrophils, a pattern typically associated with autosomal recessive variants of chronic granulomatous disease.¹⁴ Assays from patients with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease typically demonstrate a narrow peak, with activation in response to stimulation virtually absent. Test results for the parents were normal; since a carrier of the X-linked form would be expected to have a dual population of neutrophils, some showing normal activation and others with decreased activation, this finding suggests a diagnosis of autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease.\\nWe then proceeded to genetic testing. The majority of cases of chronic granulomatous disease are due to mutations in the gene gp91phox, which causes the X-linked disorder (accounting for approximately 70% of cases). Autosomal recessive cases are caused by abnormalities in the genes p47phox (approximately 20%), p22phox (approximately 5%), and p67phox (approximately 5%). Rarely, abnormalities in Rac2, a small guanosine triphosphatase, or GTPase, can cause a chronic granulomatous disease-like phenotype. In this patient, sequencing of the relevant genes identified a novel missense mutation in the p22phox gene, in which lysine was substituted for glutamic acid at amino acid 129 of exon 6. The interactions among the six NADPH oxidase components are shown in Figure 4A. Figure 4B shows a proposed model for p22phox topology.¹⁵ An alternative model exists,¹⁷,¹⁸ but there is consensus about the location of the target for p47phox binding as shown in the figure. The patient's mutation at amino acid 129 appears to affect the ability of p22phox and gp91phox to form the flavocytochrome b heterodimer (Dinauer M: personal communication), which presumably causes lack of expression of flavocytochrome b (gp91phox and p22phox complex) in neutrophils, as in most other patients with a documented p22phox mutation.\\nThe treatment of documented or suspected invasive infections in a patient such as this with chronic granulomatous disease is the same as for other immunocompromised hosts. Long-term treatment with interferon-γ has been shown to reduce the frequency of opportunistic infections, as has prophylaxis with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole and itraconazole. Currently, the only widely accepted definitive treatment is bone marrow transplantation.¹⁹,²⁰\\nDr. Harris: Unfortunately the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and a seeming Pandora's box of microbiology was opened. A blood culture obtained on hospital day 4 grew Candida parapsilosis at 72 hours, the skin biopsy obtained before admission grew A. terreus after 7 days, and blood cultures obtained on hospital days 11 through 17 were persistently positive for B. cepacia, despite the organism's susceptibility to meropenem, which the patient had been taking since hospital day 4. In addition to antimicrobial chemotherapy, treatment included interferon-γ and eventually a granulocyte transfusion, which was performed in the setting of sepsis and multiorgan failure. The patient died on hospital day 17, and permission for an autopsy was not obtained. The results of the genetic tests were obtained after the patient died.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "{'query': \"An 11-month-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of fevers and pulmonary infiltrates. One month before admission, a month after beginning a visit to India with his parents, daily fevers, with temperatures up to 38.9°C, developed, without localizing signs or symptoms. Before the family left for India, the boy's primary care physician gave him one dose of immunoglobulin intramuscularly for hepatitis A prophylaxis and prescribed mefloquine weekly for malaria prophylaxis. He was evaluated at an Indian health care facility, and amoxicillin-clavulanate was administered, but there was no improvement. On the sixth day after the onset of fevers, mefloquine was stopped and chloroquine was administered for 3 days, followed by ciprofloxacin for 3 days. Fever persisted, and a nonproductive cough developed.\\nNineteen days before his admission to this hospital, the patient was admitted to a hospital in India. His blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg and his pulse 138 beats per minute; although he had been febrile, his temperature was normal. Hepatosplenomegaly was noted, but the results of the remainder of the examination were normal. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. No parasites were seen on examination of a peripheral-blood smear, and a test for serum antibodies to Salmonella typhi was negative. A chest radiograph showed an irregular perihilar parenchymal opacity with air bronchograms and multiple smaller air-space opacities in the left perihilar region. Ampicillin-sulbactam and amikacin were administered intravenously. A tuberculin skin test showed no induration after 48 hours, and the temperature, which had been fluctuating, returned to normal on the fifth hospital day. Intravenous fluid being infused through a catheter inserted in the dorsum of the right distal forearm infiltrated into the tissue, and an adhesive bandage was applied over the site. The patient was discharged on the sixth hospital day, receiving oral amoxicillin-clavulanate and clarithromycin, and his cough gradually resolved. Nine days after discharge, and 5 days before admission to this hospital, he returned to the United States.\\nTwo days after his return to the United States, his temperature rose to 39°C, and fever recurred daily thereafter. The amoxicillin-clavulanate was stopped after completion of the course of therapy; the day before admission to this hospital, the clarithromycin was completed. On the day of admission, he was evaluated at the office of his primary care physician; his temperature was 38.7°C. An erythematous nodule, 15 to 18 mm in diameter, was present on the dorsum of the right distal forearm, at the site of the previous venipuncture. There were no other localizing signs or symptoms. A chest radiograph showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. A biopsy of the nodule on the forearm was performed, and specimens were sent for culture and pathological examination. The patient was referred to this hospital for admission.\\nThe patient was born in the United States after a full-term gestation to a primigravid mother; delivery was by cesarean section because of cephalopelvic disproportion. At birth, the patient's weight was 3.075 kg (21st percentile) and his length 53.3 cm (90th percentile). At 6 weeks of age, he had been admitted to another hospital for a self-limited episode of fever and poor feeding. A palpable spleen tip was noted on examination, and ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed that the spleen was 6.2 cm in length, the upper limit of normal for his age. A culture of the blood was sterile; his temperature returned to normal and he was discharged. Follow-up ultrasonography of the abdomen 1 month after discharge was normal. Routine immunizations were given, and developmental milestones and growth parameters were normal. At 6 months of age, his weight was 7.1 kg (18th percentile) and length 71 cm (92nd percentile). While in India, the patient and his parents had stayed with relatives in an urban area, and the patient had close contact with many people, including a relative with pulmonary tuberculosis who was receiving triple-drug therapy. There were no exposures to animals. The patient had no allergies to medications, and in the United States he lived with his parents and did not attend day care. His parents were professionals who had emigrated from India. There was no family history of recurrent febrile illnesses, rheumatologic diseases, or immunodeficiency.\\nOn examination, he appeared well — he was playful and breathing comfortably. His weight was 8.2 kg (3rd percentile), temperature 39.3°C, pulse 140 beats per minute, respiratory rate 42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% while breathing ambient air. A well-circumscribed area of erythema and induration, 1 cm by 2 cm, was present on the dorsum of the right forearm, and the incision from the biopsy was clean and dry. The lungs were clear, and the results of the remainder of the physical examination were normal. Levels of serum electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the test results for renal and liver function; the results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Tests of nasal secretions for antigens of adenovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed nodular areas of consolidation throughout both lungs, some with calcification. The larger opacities were in the upper lobes, up to 2.6 cm by 1.7 cm by 1.9 cm. Some were contiguous with the hila and extended to the pleural surface. Soft-tissue fullness in the mediastinum, hila, and left axilla suggested lymphadenopathy. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were administered orally and ceftriaxone intravenously.\\nOn the second hospital day, the temperature rose to 39.7°C. A tuberculin skin test was performed, and an aspirate of gastric secretions obtained in the early morning was sent for acidfast staining and mycobacterial culture. Isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and rifampin were begun. Analysis of a urine specimen was normal, and a culture of the urine specimen, collected in an external bag, grew few mixed flora. Specimens of stool were sent for culture of enteric pathogens, presence of Clostridium difficile toxin, and ova and parasitologic analysis.\\nDuring the next 3 days, two additional earlymorning specimens of gastric aspirate were obtained; staining did not reveal acid-fast bacilli and cultures were pending. On the fourth hospital day, the temperature rose to 40°C and the patient vomited intermittently, occasionally after episodes of coughing productive of white sputum. The site of the tuberculin skin test showed no induration. The next day, the temperature fluctuated between 34.6 and 40.1°C. Serum IgG antibodies to cytomegalovirus were present; test results for Epstein-Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus antibodies in the serum and legionella and histoplasma urine antigens were negative. Other laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Additional specimens of blood were sent for culture; results of other tests were pending. A review of the slides from the skin biopsy that had been performed earlier revealed scattered nuclear debris and rare structures suggestive of fungal hyphae; in deeper sections stained for organisms, these structures were no longer visible. Ceftriaxone was stopped and meropenem and liposomal amphotericin were administered intravenously.\\nOn the sixth hospital day, emesis was tinged with blood, and a sample of stool was guaiacpositive. The respiratory rate transiently increased to 66 to 75 breaths per minute, with oxygen saturations between 98 and 100%, then returned to 32 to 44 breaths per minute. The temperature ranged from 33.9 to 39.6°C. Additional chest radiography continued to show bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. A diagnostic procedure was performed on the seventh hospital day.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDr. Jason B. Harris: May we review the radiologic studies?\\nDr. Sjirk J. Westra: CT of the chest, performed on admission without the administration of contrast material, showed several ill-defined nodules in the posterior lung zones, several of which contained calcifications; the nodules blended with the pulmonary hila (Fig. 1A), and some extended to the pleura. One week later, CT of the chest performed with the administration of intravenous contrast material showed fullness of the soft tissues in the mediastinum, which could be explained by the normal thymus, and mild prominence of the hilar lymph nodes. The tracheobronchial tree was normally patent. Large nodules were present, predominantly in the upper lobes of the lungs, with ill-defined and spiculated margins, which was probably indicative of inflammation; the larger nodules were calcified (Fig. 1B). A chest radiograph taken 5 days later (Fig. 1C) showed ill-defined nodular infiltrates, predominantly in the middle- and upper-lung zones, and ill-defined hilar markings.\\nThe differential diagnosis of bilateral nodular pulmonary consolidation with calcifications includes granulomatous infection, particularly tuberculosis. However, calcification does not occur in primary tuberculosis, and postprimary tuberculosis would be unusual in this young child. Chronic fungal infections frequently calcify, whereas bacterial and pneumocystic infections are not usually associated with calcification. Given the clinical presentation and the appearance of these nodules, a calcifying neoplastic process, such as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (inflammatory pseudotumor) or a metastatic malignant tumor, was believed to be less likely than an infection.\\nDr. Harris: I participated in the care of this patient and am aware of the diagnosis. Fever and a cough developed in this infant during travel in India, and they recurred despite antibiotic therapy. On admission, his weight gain had slowed. Imaging studies showed a chronic multinodular pneumonia with calcification. Our differential diagnosis included infectious and noninfectious conditions, and we considered the possibility that his condition might be a manifestation of primary immunodeficiency.\\nINFECTION WITH MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS\\nThis patient's young age and close contact with an adult with pulmonary tuberculosis suggested a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, the most common cause of chronic pneumonia in the world, with approximately 2 million cases per year in India.¹ Infants younger than 1 year of age who are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis are at extremely high risk for the development of active disease, estimated to approach 40% in the first 2 years of life as compared with a 5 to 10% cumulative lifetime risk of disease in immunocompetent adults.² Does this patient's clinical presentation support the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis?\\nFirst, is the incubation period consistent with tuberculosis? This child's symptoms developed 1 month after arriving in India. Infants, unlike older children or adults, often present with symptomatic primary tuberculosis 3 to 8 weeks after exposure, and disseminated disease, such as miliary or meningeal tuberculosis, may develop 2 to 6 months after exposure.³ Are the other clinical characteristics of the patient's illness consistent with tuberculosis? Although infants are more likely than adults to present with extrapulmonary disease, the majority of infants diagnosed with tuberculosis in the United States do in fact have isolated pulmonary disease.⁴ They typically present with nonproductive cough and fever, as this patient did. The erythematous cutaneous nodule at the site of an intravenous catheter could be a cutaneous manifestation of tuberculosis, although this would be unusual. However, the nodule might have resulted from an unrelated infection, and it appeared to be resolving at the time of admission. A transient response to amikacin may also be seen in M. tuberculosis infection. Are the radiographic findings consistent with tuberculosis? Parenchymal lung disease and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are characteristic of pulmonary tuberculosis in infants. Often there is a primary complex, consisting of a parenchymal lesion with associated lymphadenitis. Although miliary involvement can occur in congenital tuberculosis, the presence of multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, some with calcification, suggesting multifocal granulomatous inflammation, is atypical.\\nFinally, what can we learn from the diagnostic studies that were obtained in the first few days of the patient's hospitalization? Acid-fast bacilli stains of early-morning gastric aspirates are often negative in children with pulmonary tuberculosis and have little negative predictive value; however, cultures will be positive in up to 70% of infants with pulmonary tuberculosis.⁴ This patient also had a negative response to a purified-protein-derivative (PPD) skin test for tuberculosis. Although the majority of infants with disseminated tuberculosis initially have a negative response to this test, 80 to 90% of immunocompetent infants with isolated pulmonary tuberculosis test positive.⁴,⁵ Although not definitive, the negative result on the PPD skin test suggests that this patient either did not have tuberculosis or was immunocompromised. Although we were concerned enough to treat this patient empirically for possible tuberculosis, we considered other infectious and noninfectious causes of his illness.\\nOTHER CAUSES OF CHRONIC MULTINODULAR PNEUMONIA\\nHistoplasmosis is endemic in India and in the United States and can mimic tuberculosis. It can manifest as a primary pulmonary infection, though infants are predisposed to progressive reticuloendothelial infection characterized by fever, failure to thrive, and hepatosplenomegaly. In this case, a urine antigen test was negative. Blastomyces and cryptococcus are also found in India and can cause chronic pneumonia and cutaneous manifestations, including isolated skin nodules and ulcers. However, these infections rarely result in calcified lung lesions. Aspergillus species are an important cause of nodular pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts, particularly patients with hematologic malignancies, neutropenia, or phagocyte disorders, and chronic infections may calcify. Thus, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis due to an underlying immunodeficiency was a consideration, despite the fact that this child had been healthy for the first 10 months of life.\\nNontuberculous mycobacteria need to be considered, especially in view of the negative finding on the PPD skin test and the partial clinical response to amikacin, which is active against nontuberculous mycobacteria. However, pulmonary infection of this magnitude with nontuberculous mycobacteria is rare in a healthy host, and symptoms recurred on use of clarithromycin, which is highly active against most nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is endemic in India and can manifest as a chronic, multinodular pneumonia. Skin manifestations, including ulcers and abscesses, can occur in isolation or as part of disseminated disease; thus, melioidosis was a possible diagnosis in this case. Rhodococcus equi is an increasingly recognized cause of chronic nodular pneumonia in immunocompromised patients; however, infection with R. equi is typically associated with exposures to animals or soil, neither of which was present in this case. Nocardia species can cause chronic lung infections, including multinodular pneumonia, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Paragonimus, a lung fluke that is endemic in India, can present as chronic pneumonia with multiple calcified nodules; however, most patients have peripheral blood eosinophilia and a history of shellfish exposure, neither of which applied in this case.\\nSarcoidosis is a chronic pulmonary granulomatous disease; however, the infantile form, Blau syndrome, does not typically involve the lungs. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (also known as inflammatory pseudotumor or plasma-cell granuloma), the most common primary lung tumor in children, is often associated with calcification.⁶ However, most of these tumors are solitary lung lesions and are not associated with fever. Metastatic Wilms' tumor or neuroblastoma can occur at this age, but there is no evidence of a primary tumor in the abdomen.\\nCHRONIC MULTINODULAR PNEUMONIA AS A MANIFESTATION OF PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCY\\nAn early concern was that the patient had a primary immunodeficiency. Primary immunodeficiency disorders are typically suspected in the presence of repeated infections, opportunistic infections, failure to thrive, a positive family history for such a disorder, hematologic abnormalities, abnormal responses to common infections, or characteristic features of a syndrome associated with immunodeficiency, such as DiGeorge's syndrome, which is distinguished by cleft palate, endocrine abnormalities, and congenital heart defects. Because many immunodeficiency syndromes can present after 6 months of age, the fact that this child had thrived in early infancy does not exclude such a diagnosis. Although we had not documented the presence of an opportunistic infection, the finding of multiple calcified pulmonary nodules suggested that a chronic granulomatous process preceded the visit to India and the development of symptoms. This could represent an abnormal response to infection — a characteristic feature of chronic granulomatous disease.\\nChronic granulomatous disease, which is due to a primary defect of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase pathway, is one of the most common serious primary immunodeficiency syndromes, with an incidence of at least 1 in 200,000 births in the United States.⁷ The clinical manifestations are listed in Table 2. Pulmonary infection occurs in more than 80% of cases, particularly in a form of calcifying multinodular pneumonia known as encapsulating pneumonia.⁷,⁸ Another common clinical manifestation is the formation of relatively painless subcutaneous nodules, known as cold abscesses, which are a classic manifestation of phagocytic dysfunction. This patient's lung and skin lesions are thus highly characteristic of chronic granulomatous disease.\\nThe diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease is often suggested by a microbiologic diagnosis, since the majority of infections in this disease are due to five catalase-producing microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, B. cepacia, Serratia marcescens, nocardia species, and aspergillus species. Aspergillus is the predominant causative agent of pulmonary infections, accounting for more than 40% of cases in which a causative organism is identified.⁷ Aspergillus and B. cepacia account for many of the deaths in patients with chronic granulomatous disease.⁷\\nDuring the course of our patient's treatment at this hospital, additional information was obtained that increased our concern for chronic granulomatous disease. Although there was no family history of immunodeficiency, we learned that the patient's parents were closely related. Consanguinity greatly increases the likelihood of an autosomal recessive disorder. In addition, the skin biopsy was interpreted as showing a possible fungal hypha, which heightened our suspicion that the patient had chronic granulomatous disease.\\nOther causes of primary immunodeficiency are much less likely. Cystic fibrosis and ciliary defects are associated with chronic sinopulmonary disease, but they are usually associated with bronchiectasis. T-cell and B-cell immunodeficiencies can present with pneumonia, but in this case the normal immunoglobulin levels, the lack of lymphopenia, and the lack of prior recurrent infections or chronic diarrhea argue against these immunodeficiencies. Other phagocytic disorders include deficiencies in the interferon-γ-interleukin-12 receptor signaling pathway. Like chronic granulomatous disease, these disorders are associated with a remarkably specific microbiology — typically mycobacterial infections or nontyphoid salmonellosis. However, these disorders are much less common than chronic granulomatous disease.\\nDIAGNOSTIC TESTING\\nTo evaluate for chronic granulomatous disease, on the fourth hospital day we sent peripheralblood leukocytes from this patient to another laboratory for an oxidative burst assay. While this result was pending, we obtained a specimen from the involved lung tissue for histopathology and culture, which we considered essential to establishing a diagnosis.\\nDR. JASON B. HARRIS'S DIAGNOSIS\\nInfectious pneumonia, probably due to aspergillus species and probably complicating chronic granulomatous disease.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDr. Richard L. Kradin: Pathological examination of a video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy specimen of the right upper lobe of the lung revealed necrotizing granulomas, primarily centered on small airways (Fig. 2A), with extensive necrosis and dystrophic calcifications (Fig. 2B). Special stains were negative for mycobacteria, but Gomori's methenamine silver staining (Fig. 2C) revealed fragmented, varicose, septate hyphae with rare orthogonal pyriform conidia in areas of necrosis. The presence of fragmented varicose hyphae with small, lateral, pyriform conidiophores and conidia in tissue are typical of aspergillus of the flavipes-terreus group.¹⁰ A hyphal form was highlighted by immunohistochemical staining for aspergillus species. Cultures of the specimen showed no growth of fungi or bacteria, but a culture of the skin-biopsy specimen that had been obtained before admission grew Aspergillus terreus. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease are most commonly infected with A. fumigatus or A. nidulans.¹¹ A. terreus is a ubiquitous environmental fungus, which is emerging as an important pathogen in pulmonary infections in immunocompromised hosts.¹²,¹³\\nThe host response to aspergillus in this case mimics that of a mycobacterial or fungal yeast infection. Whereas invasive infections due to aspergillus species are well recognized in chronic granulomatous disease, well-defined necrotizing granulomatous inflammation is infrequent. As there was no evidence of angioinvasion in the sampled lung tissue, the infection is best classified as invasive chronic necrotizing aspergillosis, which is distinguished specifically by the absence of vascular invasion.\\nDr. Ian C. Michelow: The dihydrorhodamine assay, a quantitative measure of NADPH oxidase function during the respiratory burst of phagocytic cells, is the diagnostic test for chronic granulomatous disease. Chronic granulomatous disease is caused by mutations in genes that encode for one or more of the six components of the NADPH oxidase complex, an enzyme that is present in phagocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages and is critical to the production of the reactive oxygen species that help eradicate organisms that have been subject to phagocytosis. In our patient, the assay (Fig. 3) showed a broad peak of fluorescence that was lower than that of normal neutrophils, a pattern typically associated with autosomal recessive variants of chronic granulomatous disease.¹⁴ Assays from patients with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease typically demonstrate a narrow peak, with activation in response to stimulation virtually absent. Test results for the parents were normal; since a carrier of the X-linked form would be expected to have a dual population of neutrophils, some showing normal activation and others with decreased activation, this finding suggests a diagnosis of autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease.\\nWe then proceeded to genetic testing. The majority of cases of chronic granulomatous disease are due to mutations in the gene gp91phox, which causes the X-linked disorder (accounting for approximately 70% of cases). Autosomal recessive cases are caused by abnormalities in the genes p47phox (approximately 20%), p22phox (approximately 5%), and p67phox (approximately 5%). Rarely, abnormalities in Rac2, a small guanosine triphosphatase, or GTPase, can cause a chronic granulomatous disease-like phenotype. In this patient, sequencing of the relevant genes identified a novel missense mutation in the p22phox gene, in which lysine was substituted for glutamic acid at amino acid 129 of exon 6. The interactions among the six NADPH oxidase components are shown in Figure 4A. Figure 4B shows a proposed model for p22phox topology.¹⁵ An alternative model exists,¹⁷,¹⁸ but there is consensus about the location of the target for p47phox binding as shown in the figure. The patient's mutation at amino acid 129 appears to affect the ability of p22phox and gp91phox to form the flavocytochrome b heterodimer (Dinauer M: personal communication), which presumably causes lack of expression of flavocytochrome b (gp91phox and p22phox complex) in neutrophils, as in most other patients with a documented p22phox mutation.\\nThe treatment of documented or suspected invasive infections in a patient such as this with chronic granulomatous disease is the same as for other immunocompromised hosts. Long-term treatment with interferon-γ has been shown to reduce the frequency of opportunistic infections, as has prophylaxis with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole and itraconazole. Currently, the only widely accepted definitive treatment is bone marrow transplantation.¹⁹,²⁰\\nDr. Harris: Unfortunately the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and a seeming Pandora's box of microbiology was opened. A blood culture obtained on hospital day 4 grew Candida parapsilosis at 72 hours, the skin biopsy obtained before admission grew A. terreus after 7 days, and blood cultures obtained on hospital days 11 through 17 were persistently positive for B. cepacia, despite the organism's susceptibility to meropenem, which the patient had been taking since hospital day 4. In addition to antimicrobial chemotherapy, treatment included interferon-γ and eventually a granulocyte transfusion, which was performed in the setting of sepsis and multiorgan failure. The patient died on hospital day 17, and permission for an autopsy was not obtained. The results of the genetic tests were obtained after the patient died.\", 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"Based on the patient's presentation, history, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is **Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)**.\\n\\nHere's the reasoning:\\n\\n1.  **Information Gathering:**\\n    *   **Age:** 11 months old.\\n    *   **Presenting Symptoms:** Fever, pulmonary infiltrates, cough, and a nodule on the forearm.\\n    *   **History:**\\n        *   Travel to India (exposure to potential pathogens).\\n        *   Immunoglobulin injection (Hepatitis A prophylaxis).\\n        *   Mefloquine and chloroquine prophylaxis (malaria).\\n        *   Amoxicillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin (treatment for presumed bacterial infection).\\n        *   Previous episode of fever and splenomegaly at 6 weeks.\\n        *   Contact with a relative with pulmonary tuberculosis.\\n        *   No known allergies.\\n    *   **Laboratory Findings:**\\n        *   Normal electrolytes and renal/liver function.\\n        *   Negative Salmonella typhi test.\\n        *   Chest radiograph showing pulmonary infiltrates and a nodule.\\n        *   Negative tuberculin skin test.\\n        *   Negative adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and RSV tests.\\n        *   CT chest showing nodular consolidation with calcification.\\n        *   Skin biopsy showing fungal hyphae (later confirmed as *Aspergillus terreus*).\\n        *   Blood cultures positive for *B. cepacia* and *Candida parapsilosis*.\\n        *   Negative urine antigen tests for *Legionella* and *Histoplasma*.\\n        *   Normal urine analysis.\\n        *   Negative CMV and EBV serology.\\n        *   Genetic testing confirmed a novel mutation in the *p22phox* gene.\\n\\n2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\\n\\n    *   **Infectious Causes:**\\n        *   Tuberculosis (TB): Negative tuberculin skin test, but possible reactivation.\\n        *   Fungal Infections: *Aspergillus* (confirmed), *Candida*, *Histoplasma*, *Blastomyces*.\\n        *   Bacterial Infections: *Staphylococcus aureus*, *B. cepacia*, *Nocardia*, *Burkholderia pseudomallei*.\\n        *   Other: *Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)*, *Pneumocystis jirovecii*.\\n    *   **Non-Infectious Causes:**\\n        *   Sarcoidosis.\\n        *   Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor (inflammatory pseudotumor).\\n        *   Metastatic Cancer.\\n        *   Primary Immunodeficiency (CGD).\\n\\n3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\\n\\n    *   **Infectious:**\\n        *   TB: The negative tuberculin skin test is atypical, but not definitive.

Addo (Infectious Disease): A 52-year-old woman was admitted to this\\nhospital in late summer because of fever and confusion. The patient had been well\\nuntil 9 days earlier, when she told family members that she felt unwell. During the\\nnext 4 days, fatigue, lethargy, tenderness over the mastoid, tingling of the tongue,\\nmyalgias of the legs, and headache developed. Five days before admission, she saw\\nher primary care physician; results of routine laboratory tests were said to be normal.\\nComputed tomography (CT) of the mastoid was scheduled.\\nTwo days before admission, the patient returned home from work feeling more\\ntired and went directly to bed. The next morning, she appeared listless and would\\nnot arise; her husband noted that her skin was hot and her temperature was 39.7°C.\\nHe administered acetaminophen. Later that day, a neighbor noted that the patient\\nappeared to be confused. Emergency medical services were called, and she was\\ntransported to another hospital by ambulance.\\nIn the emergency department, the patient was lethargic and disoriented, with\\nslow and inappropriate responses to questions. Her temperature was 37.4°C, and\\nher pulse 112 beats per minute; respirations were 28 breaths per minute, and the\\noxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Her pupils\\nwere equal and reactive to light and accommodation. Mucous membranes were dry\\nand pink. The neck was supple. She moved all limbs; reflexes and gait were not tested.\\nResults of the remainder of the examination were normal. An electrocardiogram\\nshowed sinus tachycardia and was otherwise normal. Tests of renal and liver func-\\ntion were normal. The results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Speci-\\nmens of blood were obtained for culture. A chest radiograph revealed a small amount\\nof atelectasis in the right lung, and CT of the head without the administration of\\ncontrast material showed clear sinuses, with no evidence of bleeding, mass effect,\\nor focal lesion. A lumbar puncture was performed; the results of an analysis of ce-\\nrebrospinal fluid are shown in Table 2. Samples were sent for viral and bacterial\\ncultures, polymerase-chain-reaction testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and West\\nNile virus, and testing for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, West Nile virus, and east-\\nern equine encephalitis virus. On reexamination by a consultant in infectious dis-\\neases, the patient\\'s neck was stiff, and there\\nwas pain on bending of the neck. Droplet pre-\\ncautions were instituted, and ceftriaxone (2 g),\\nvancomycin (1 g), ampicillin (2 g), acyclovir (750\\nmg), and dexamethasone (12 mg) were adminis-\\ntered intravenously.\\nApproximately 3½ hours after the patient\\'s\\narrival at the hospital, a tonic-clonic seizure oc-\\ncurred and lasted for 20 seconds. The temperature\\nwas 39.4°C on a reading from the rectum. Fos-\\nphenytoin (1 g) and lorazepam (2 mg) were ad-\\nministered intravenously, and acetaminophen\\n(1000 mg) was given through the rectum. After the\\nseizure, the patient became increasingly somno-\\nlent and did not respond to painful stimuli. The\\ntrachea was intubated for airway protection. Ap-\\nproximately 5 hours after arrival, she was trans-\\nferred by ambulance to this hospital.\\nOn arrival, additional history was obtained\\nfrom her husband and other relatives. She had\\nbeen well and worked in an office. She was mar-\\nried, had no children, and lived with her husband\\nin a rural, wooded area with a moderate amount\\nof wetlands in southeastern Massachusetts. She\\nhad not traveled outside the state during the pre-\\nceding 10 months, and she had not traveled in-\\nternationally in more than 5 years. She had no al-\\nlergies or recent exposures to tuberculosis or ill\\npersons. She had no pets and no exposures to\\nticks, rodents, wild game, or birds. She may have\\neaten unpasteurized cheese in the past; she drank\\nalcohol socially but did not smoke or use illicit\\ndrugs. She swam in a chlorinated swimming pool,\\nspent time outdoors, and had been bitten by mos-\\nquitoes. Seven days before admission, her com-\\nmunity was sprayed aerially because three isolates\\nof mammal-biting mosquitoes had been identified\\nas carrying eastern equine encephalitis virus. Her\\nparents were deceased; she had a sister who\\nwas well.\\nOn examination, the patient was sedated, and\\nthe trachea intubated. The temperature was 37.7°C,\\nthe blood pressure 113/57 mm Hg, and the pulse\\n100 beats per minute. The pupils were 2 mm in\\ndiameter; the lungs were clear. There were two\\npapules that appeared to be insect bites on the\\nright lateral malleolus and left medial calcaneus;\\nthe results of the remainder of the examination\\nwere unchanged.\\nScreening of serum and urine specimens for\\ntoxins was negative; other laboratory-test results\\nare shown in Table 1. Analysis of a urine specimen\\nrevealed glucose (2+) and was otherwise normal.\\nSpecimens of blood and urine were obtained for\\nculture. A chest radiograph showed an endotra-\\ncheal tube in the trachea, with the tip at the level\\nof the carina; low lung volumes with bibasilar\\nsubsegmental atelectasis; and a nasogastric tube in\\nthe stomach. The patient intermittently attempted\\nto sit up; propofol was administered as needed\\nfor sedation. She was admitted to the medical\\nintensive care unit. Blood specimens were sent to\\nthe Massachusetts State Laboratory Institute for\\ntesting for evidence of infection with eastern\\nequine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus.\\nVancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, dexametha-\\nsone, acyclovir, and phenytoin were continued;\\ninsulin for hyperglycemia was administered on a\\nsliding scale; dalteparin and esomeprazole were\\nbegun. Acetaminophen was administered as\\nneeded for fever, and potassium chloride, mag-\\nnesium sulfate, and calcium gluconate were\\ngiven intravenously.\\nDuring the first hospital day, the maximum\\ntemperature was 38.7°C. The pupils were 1 mm in\\ndiameter and minimally reactive to light; the neck\\nwas supple. There were 2+ deep-tendon reflexes in\\nthe arms; other reflexes were absent, and the plan-\\ntar responses were flexor; the remainder of the\\nexamination was normal. When propofol was\\ntransiently withheld, the patient moved all limbs\\nand appeared agitated. Another lumbar puncture\\nwas performed (Table 2).\\nOn the second hospital day, continuous elec-\\ntroencephalographic monitoring revealed epilep-\\ntiform activity that resolved after propofol was\\ndiscontinued, and boluses of lorazepam and fos-\\nphenytoin, followed by levetiracetam, were admin-\\nistered. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the\\nbrain, performed without the administration of\\ncontrast material, showed areas of hyperintensity\\non fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) im-\\nages, with mild mass effect in both cerebellar\\nhemispheres, the left thalamus, the left insula, and\\nthe left basal ganglia. Most of the lesions had\\nnormal-to-decreased diffusion. There was no evi-\\ndence of intracranial hemorrhage. Swabs of the\\nthroat and rectum were obtained for viral cultures,\\nand droplet precautions were discontinued. Ex-\\namination revealed extensor posturing of the\\narms, purposeful withdrawal of the legs in re-\\nsponse to painful stimuli, brisk reflexes, and clo-\\nnus of 8 to 12 beats in the feet; the Babinski sign\\nwas present, with an extensor plantar reflex. An\\ninsulin infusion was initiated, and the use of hy-\\npotonic intravenous solutions was discontinued.\\nThe temperature rose to 39.2°C, and a cooling\\nblanket was applied.\\nOn the third hospital day, there was extensor\\nposturing of all limbs, corneal reflexes were\\ndecreased, and cold caloric testing of the left ear\\nrevealed a minimal horizontal movement of the\\neyes. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1.\\nHypertonic saline and mannitol were infused, and\\nan intracranial-pressure monitoring bolt was in-\\nserted. Another MRI scan of the brain showed no\\nchange. The maximum temperature was 39.9°C.\\nOn the fourth hospital day, the result of a\\ndiagnostic test was received.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDr. Martin S. Hirsch: May we review the imaging\\nstudies?\\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: An MRI scan of the brain,\\nobtained without the administration of contrast\\nmaterial, shows hyperintensity on FLAIR images\\nin the temporal, frontal, parietal, and occipital\\ncortex and subcortical white matter (greater on\\nthe left than on the right), in both cerebellar hemi-\\nspheres, and in the left thalamus, the left insula,\\nand the left basal ganglia (Fig. 1). Most of the\\nlesions have mild mass effect and normal-to-\\ndecreased diffusion.\\nThe differential diagnosis of diffuse abnor-\\nmalities in the deep gray nuclei and cortical-sub-\\ncortical areas with mild mass effect includes viral\\nencephalitis, subacute hypoxic-ischemic injury,\\nmultifocal infiltrating glioma, and paraneoplas-\\ntic limbic encephalitis.\\nDr. Hirsch: To most people, summertime in\\nMassachusetts brings thoughts of the beach, boat-\\ning, and swimming. To those of us in the infec-\\ntious diseases community, it also brings thoughts\\nof arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) diseases.\\nWhen a febrile illness characterized by headache,\\nneck stiffness, confusion, and increasing lethargy\\nprogressing to coma develops in a previously\\nhealthy 52-year-old woman from a rural, wooded\\narea near wetlands in southeastern Massachusetts,\\nthoughts of arbovirus encephalitis become para-\\nmount.\\nAlthough the clinical findings strongly suggest\\nviral encephalitis, initially, it is important to con-\\ntemplate a broad differential diagnosis, so that\\npotentially life-threatening but treatable condi-\\ntions are ruled out. Noninfectious causes, such as\\nstroke or brain tumor, need to be considered in\\nany patient with progressive neurologic dysfunc-\\ntion, but the inflammatory features of this pa-\\ntient\\'s cerebrospinal fluid, together with the re-\\nsults of her electroencephalographic and brain\\nimaging studies, make these diagnoses highly\\nunlikely.\\nIt is far more likely that an acute infection\\nof the central nervous system developed in this\\nwoman. Although epidemiologic and clinical\\nfactors force us to think about arboviral en-\\ncephalitides, we should first consider other treat-\\nable causes of infections of the central nervous\\nsystem.\\nBACTERIAL INFECTIONS\\nAcute bacterial meningitis must always be ruled\\nout when a febrile illness is complicated by head-\\nache, stiff neck, and rapidly progressive neurolog-\\nic signs and symptoms. In this case, it was appro-\\npriate to begin broad-spectrum antibiotics on\\nadmission to cover the major potential bacterial\\npathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae, Neis-\\nseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Lis-\\nteria monocytogenes. However, the findings on analy-\\nsis of cerebrospinal fluid (relatively normal glucose\\nlevel, relative lymphocytosis, a negative Gram\\'s\\nstain, and negative bacterial cultures for the first\\n3 days of hospitalization) make this diagnosis\\nunlikely.\\nCould this syndrome be a manifestation of\\nearly Lyme disease of the central nervous system?\\nInfection with B. burgdorferi is common in rural\\nMassachusetts during the summer, and although\\nthe patient had no known exposures to ticks, such\\nexposure often goes unrecognized. Although such\\ncases are rare, neurologic features can be the first\\nmanifestations of Lyme disease, and the classic\\nfindings of erythema migrans and arthritis may\\nbe absent. However, the principal early neurologic\\nmanifestations of Lyme disease are meningitis,\\ncranial neuropathy, and radiculoneuropathy.1,2\\nA fulminant encephalitis, as seen in this woman,\\nwould be distinctly unusual. However, since neu-\\nroborreliosis is potentially treatable, testing of ce-\\nrebrospinal fluid for B. burgdorferi DNA or anti-\\nbodies is appropriate.\\nSeveral other bacterial infections, including\\nsyphilis, leptospirosis, and tuberculosis, as well\\nas fungal infections, do not seem likely, given the\\npace of the disease, the findings on analysis of\\ncerebrospinal fluid, and neuroradiologic manifes-\\ntations. Parameningeal foci of infection, includ-\\ning brain abscess, also seem highly unlikely in\\nview of the diffuse nature of the MRI results.\\nVIRAL INFECTIONS\\nCentral nervous system manifestations may com-\\nplicate enterovirus infections during the summer.\\nHowever, self-limited aseptic meningitis is the most\\nfrequent neurologic manifestation of enterovirus\\ninfection, and encephalitis is unusual. Other viral\\ninfections, including mumps, human immuno-\\ndeficiency virus type 1 infection, and lymphocytic\\nchoriomeningitis, may cause encephalitis, but there\\nis no epidemiologic or clinical evidence of any of\\nthese infections in this patient.\\nHaving eliminated several potential causes of\\nthis woman\\'s illness, I shall concentrate on what\\nappear to be the most likely diagnoses: HSV and\\ntwo arboviruses West Nile virus and eastern\\nequine encephalitis virus.\\nHerpes Simplex Virus\\nHSV encephalitis is the most frequently recognized\\nform of sporadic encephalitis in the United States,\\nand much progress has been made in the devel-\\nopment of both techniques for early detection and\\neffective treatments.3,4 In this case, it was appro-\\npriate to begin acyclovir therapy pending the re-\\nsults of diagnostic testing. However, neuroimag-\\ning and electroencephalography usually point to\\nthe temporal lobes in this disorder, and lesions\\nare rarely seen in basal ganglia and the cerebel-\\nlum.4 Most important, the nucleic acid amplifica-\\ntion test for HSV types 1 and 2 in the cerebrospi-\\nnal fluid, a highly sensitive and specific assay,3\\nwas negative, making this diagnosis highly un-\\nlikely.\\nArboviruses\\nSeveral features in the history strongly suggest an\\narbovirus infection. These include residence in a\\nrural, wooded area near wetlands in southeastern\\nMassachusetts, a history of time spent outdoors,\\nrecent mosquito bites, and aerial spraying of the\\narea because of mammal-biting mosquitoes car-\\nrying the eastern equine encephalitis virus. More-\\nover, what appeared to be insect bites were noted\\non the patient\\'s skin on admission. If she had\\ntraveled to other parts of the United States or out-\\nside the country, the differential diagnosis would\\nbe considerably broadened.5 However, we are told\\nthat she had not traveled outside Massachusetts\\nduring the preceding 10 months or internation-\\nally in more than 5 years. Under those circum-\\nstances, our consideration of possible arbovirus-\\nes narrows to two candidates.\\nWest Nile Virus\\nSeveral features of this patient\\'s illness are com-\\npatible with encephalitis resulting from infection\\nwith West Nile virus, an RNA flavivirus of the\\nJapanese encephalitis subgroup. An enzootic sys-\\ntem between mosquitoes and birds maintains and\\namplifies West Nile virus; mammals, including\\nhorses and humans, are incidental “dead-end\"\\nhosts. Since its recognition in 1999,7 West Nile\\nvirus has spread through migratory birds across\\nNorth America, resulting in the largest outbreaks\\nof arbovirus encephalitis in U.S. history. Neuro-\\nlogic diseases associated with West Nile virus,\\nincluding meningitis, encephalitis, and a combi-\\nnation of the two, are seen most often among the\\nelderly and people who are immunocompromised.8\\nClinical manifestations of West Nile virus enceph-\\nalitis include fever, headache, and altered mental\\nstatus. Tremors, myoclonus, cranial-nerve palsies,\\nand movement disorders also occur, although sei-\\nzures are unusual. Acute flaccid paralysis identi-\\ncal to that seen during poliovirus infections has\\nalso been described.º Electroencephalographic ab-\\nnormalities may include generalized slowing, as\\nseen in this case, and neuroimaging studies are\\noften normal, particularly early in the course of the\\ndisease, in contrast to the findings in this case.8\\nIsolates of this virus are now recovered annu-\\nally in Massachusetts; discussions of two cases\\nof West Nile virus encephalitis have been pub-\\nlished in the Journal. 10,11 Thus, we must strongly\\nconsider this possibility and assume that the ce-\\nrebrospinal fluid specimens sent out to be tested\\nfor the virus will be informative.\\nEastern Equine Encephalitis Virus\\nEastern equine encephalitis virus is the most\\nneuropathogenic arbovirus transmitted in the\\nUnited States. An enzootic amplification cycle is\\nmaintained between birds and Culiseta melanura\\nmosquitoes in shaded swampy areas of eastern\\nNorth America, with various mosquito species\\nserving as bridge vectors to susceptible mammals\\n(Fig. 2). Cases of eastern equine encephalitis in\\nhumans generally occur in the Northeast between\\nJuly and October.12 This woman lived in a wood-\\ned area, spent time outdoors, had received mos-\\nquito bites, and had cutaneous lesions that were\\nconsistent with bites, so we can assume it was\\nsummer or early autumn.\\nIncubation periods generally exceed 1 week and\\nare followed by a prodrome of fever, headache,\\nand other influenza-like symptoms, similar to\\nthose in this patient. Once neurologic manifes-\\ntations develop, deterioration is rapid.13 Seizures\\nand focal neurologic signs, including cranial-nerve\\npalsies, are common, as are peripheral-blood leu-\\nkocytosis and hyponatremia. Neutrophil-predom-\\ninant pleocytosis and elevated protein levels are\\noften found in the cerebrospinal fluid, whereas\\nglucose levels are normal. Electroencephalogra-\\nphy initially shows generalized slowing; later, lat-\\neralizing epileptiform discharges may be seen, as\\nin this case.13 MRI shows areas of increased sig-\\nnal intensity, often unilateral or asymmetric, most\\ncommonly in the basal ganglia and the thalamus;\\nmass effect can be observed with large lesions,\\nas in this case.13\\nThe diagnosis is generally made on detection\\nof IgM antibodies specific to eastern equine en-\\ncephalitis in the cerebrospinal fluid, although de-\\ntection of viral RNA or antigen in appropriate\\nspecimens is also possible. Increases in serum\\nlevels of antibodies specific to the virus confirm\\nthe diagnosis.\\nSUMMARY\\nIn this case, all the epidemiologic and clinical\\nfindings suggest the diagnosis of infection with\\neastern equine encephalitis virus, although I can-\\nnot rule out a severe case of encephalitis caused\\nby infection with West Nile virus. I cannot differ-\\nentiate these two entities clinically, except that\\neastern equine encephalitis tends to be more se-\\nvere than West Nile virus encephalitis. I believe\\nthat the results of the diagnostic test received on\\nday 4 were an abnormality observed in the cere-\\nbrospinal fluid that confirms the diagnosis of\\neastern equine encephalitis.\\nDr. Eric S. Rosenberg (Pathology): Dr. Ning, what\\nwere your impressions when you initially evalu-\\nated this patient?\\nDr. Ming-Ming Ning (Neurology): The neurology\\nteam\\'s impression was that of a diffuse cerebro-\\ncortical injury that resulted in cortical irritation,\\nwhich resulted in seizure; thalamic involvement\\nwas also contributing to the patient\\'s obtunda-\\ntion. Because of the rapid progression of the\\nillness, the patient\\'s poor neurologic status, and\\nthe fact that she was young, immunocompetent,\\nand living in a region where arborvirus infection\\nis endemic, we suspected a rapidly progressive\\narbovirus encephalitis, such as eastern equine\\nencephalitis. HSV encephalitis appeared to be less\\nlikely, because even with extensive multifocal corti-\\ncal involvement, there was no hemorrhage, which\\nis atypical for HSV.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nEastern equine encephalitis.\\nDR. MARTIN S. HIRSCH\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nEastern equine encephalitis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDr. John A. Branda: Specimens of blood and cere-\\nbrospinal fluid obtained on admission were neg-\\native for antibodies against West Nile virus, and\\ntesting for serum antibody to B. burgdorferi was\\nnegative. Nucleic acid testing of cerebrospinal flu-\\nid was negative for enteroviral RNA, West Nile vi-\\nrus RNA, and B. burgdorferi DNA.\\nCerebrospinal fluid specimens submitted from\\nthe other hospital the day before admission to\\nthis hospital and cerebrospinal fluid and serum\\nsamples obtained on admission to this hospital\\nwere positive for IgM antibodies to eastern equine\\nencephalitis virus, negative for IgG antibodies\\n(testing performed on serum only), and positive\\nfor eastern equine encephalitis nucleic acid (test-\\ning performed on cerebrospinal fluid only). To\\nconfirm the specificity of the antibody for east-\\nern equine encephalitis virus, a plaque-reduction\\nneutralization test was performed on a serum\\nspecimen, and it was positive. These laboratory\\nresults confirmed the diagnosis of eastern equine\\nencephalitis viral infection.\\nDr. Rosenberg: Dr. DeMaria, will you describe\\nthe epidemiology of eastern equine encephalitis\\nin Massachusetts?\\nDr. Alfred DeMaria, Jr.: The year that this patient\\nacquired eastern equine encephalitis was the third\\nconsecutive year in which the number of cases\\nin humans had increased in Massachusetts (Ta-\\nble 3). From 2004 through 2006, a total of 13\\ncases of eastern equine encephalitis occurred in\\nthe state, with 6 deaths. Infections were acquired\\nin the southeastern part of the state, which has\\nthe largest area of white cedar-red maple swamp\\nthe habitat of the C. melanura mosquito and the\\nmigratory birds that are the intermediate host\\nfor the virus. 14,15 Although the first cases in\\nhorses were noted in Massachusetts in 1831, the\\nfirst outbreak in humans was not reported until\\n1938. In the 19th century, white cedars were de-\\npleted for shingle production, and there was a\\nreduction in the C. melanura habitat, but in the 20th\\ncentury, with the introduction of asphalt shin-\\ngles, the white cedar wetlands resumed growth,\\npossibly facilitating an increase in cases of east-\\nern equine encephalitis.16 For reasons that are not\\nentirely clear, cases of eastern equine encephalitis\\nin humans in Massachusetts occur in cycles lasting\\n2 to 3 years every 10 to 20 years (Table 3).12,14,15\\nThe increase in cases shortly before this pa-\\ntient became ill led to the aerial application of\\nphenothrin, a synthetic pyrethroid pesticide, over\\na wide area of southeastern Massachusetts to re-\\nduce the number of infected adult mosquitoes and\\nthus the risk of human infection. Symptoms de-\\nveloped in this patient almost simultaneously with\\nthe aerial application of pesticide, so she had pre-\\nsumably been exposed to an infected mosquito\\nbefore the spraying of her community. In addition\\nto aerial spraying, effective personal protective\\nmeasures that should be reinforced by health care\\nprofessionals include avoidance of outdoor activ-\\nity at dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are most\\nactive; consistent, correct, and careful use of re-\\npellents; and reduction of mosquito-breeding sites\\naround the home.\\nDr. Rosenberg: Dr. Buonanno, how is the pa-\\ntient?\\nDr. Ferdinando S. Buonanno (Neurology): On hos-\\npital day 25, the patient was discharged to a re-\\nhabilitation hospital. I saw her in my office about\\n5 months after discharge, and at that time, she\\nremained severely impaired. Despite psychostim-\\nulants such as amantadine and high doses of\\nmethylphenidate, she was stuporous but arous-\\nable. She remained spastic and hypertonic, with\\nunsustained clonus. She would open her eyes but\\nthen drift off to sleep immediately. She did not\\nvocalize during the visit.\\nDr. Thomas R. Spitzer (Hematology-Oncology):\\nAre there any promising advances in antiviral\\ntherapy?\\nDr. Hirsch: There are no approved antiviral agents\\nfor either West Nile virus or eastern equine en-\\ncephalitis virus. Trials have been conducted or\\nare under way for the treatment of infection with\\nWest Nile virus, using agents such as interferons\\nand hyperimmune globulins. However, since east-\\nern equine encephalitis is so uncommon, there has\\nnot been much incentive to develop drugs that are\\nactive against this virus.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

Addo (Infectious Disease): A 52-year-old woman was admitted to this\\nhospital in late summer because of fever and confusion. The patient had been well\\nuntil 9 days earlier, when she told family members that she felt unwell. During the\\nnext 4 days, fatigue, lethargy, tenderness over the mastoid, tingling of the tongue,\\nmyalgias of the legs, and headache developed. Five days before admission, she saw\\nher primary care physician; results of routine laboratory tests were said to be normal.\\nComputed tomography (CT) of the mastoid was scheduled.\\nTwo days before admission, the patient returned home from work feeling more\\ntired and went directly to bed. The next morning, she appeared listless and would\\nnot arise; her husband noted that her skin was hot and her temperature was 39.7°C.\\nHe administered acetaminophen. Later that day, a neighbor noted that the patient\\nappeared to be confused. Emergency medical services were called, and she was\\ntransported to another hospital by ambulance.\\nIn the emergency department, the patient was lethargic and disoriented, with\\nslow and inappropriate responses to questions. Her temperature was 37.4°C, and\\nher pulse 112 beats per minute; respirations were 28 breaths per minute, and the\\noxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Her pupils\\nwere equal and reactive to light and accommodation. Mucous membranes were dry\\nand pink. The neck was supple. She moved all limbs; reflexes and gait were not tested.\\nResults of the remainder of the examination were normal. An electrocardiogram\\nshowed sinus tachycardia and was otherwise normal. Tests of renal and liver func-\\ntion were normal. The results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Speci-\\nmens of blood were obtained for culture. A chest radiograph revealed a small amount\\nof atelectasis in the right lung, and CT of the head without the administration of\\ncontrast material showed clear sinuses, with no evidence of bleeding, mass effect,\\nor focal lesion. A lumbar puncture was performed; the results of an analysis of ce-\\nrebrospinal fluid are shown in Table 2. Samples were sent for viral and bacterial\\ncultures, polymerase-chain-reaction testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and West\\nNile virus, and testing for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, West Nile virus, and east-\\nern equine encephalitis virus. On reexamination by a consultant in infectious dis-\\neases, the patient\\'s neck was stiff, and there\\nwas pain on bending of the neck. Droplet pre-\\ncautions were instituted, and ceftriaxone (2 g),\\nvancomycin (1 g), ampicillin (2 g), acyclovir (750\\nmg), and dexamethasone (12 mg) were adminis-\\ntered intravenously.\\nApproximately 3½ hours after the patient\\'s\\narrival at the hospital, a tonic-clonic seizure oc-\\ncurred and lasted for 20 seconds. The temperature\\nwas 39.4°C on a reading from the rectum. Fos-\\nphenytoin (1 g) and lorazepam (2 mg) were ad-\\nministered intravenously, and acetaminophen\\n(1000 mg) was given through the rectum. After the\\nseizure, the patient became increasingly somno-\\nlent and did not respond to painful stimuli. The\\ntrachea was intubated for airway protection. Ap-\\nproximately 5 hours after arrival, she was trans-\\nferred by ambulance to this hospital.\\nOn arrival, additional history was obtained\\nfrom her husband and other relatives. She had\\nbeen well and worked in an office. She was mar-\\nried, had no children, and lived with her husband\\nin a rural, wooded area with a moderate amount\\nof wetlands in southeastern Massachusetts. She\\nhad not traveled outside the state during the pre-\\nceding 10 months, and she had not traveled in-\\nternationally in more than 5 years. She had no al-\\nlergies or recent exposures to tuberculosis or ill\\npersons. She had no pets and no exposures to\\nticks, rodents, wild game, or birds. She may have\\neaten unpasteurized cheese in the past; she drank\\nalcohol socially but did not smoke or use illicit\\ndrugs. She swam in a chlorinated swimming pool,\\nspent time outdoors, and had been bitten by mos-\\nquitoes. Seven days before admission, her com-\\nmunity was sprayed aerially because three isolates\\nof mammal-biting mosquitoes had been identified\\nas carrying eastern equine encephalitis virus. Her\\nparents were deceased; she had a sister who\\nwas well.\\nOn examination, the patient was sedated, and\\nthe trachea intubated. The temperature was 37.7°C,\\nthe blood pressure 113/57 mm Hg, and the pulse\\n100 beats per minute. The pupils were 2 mm in\\ndiameter; the lungs were clear. There were two\\npapules that appeared to be insect bites on the\\nright lateral malleolus and left medial calcaneus;\\nthe results of the remainder of the examination\\nwere unchanged.\\nScreening of serum and urine specimens for\\ntoxins was negative; other laboratory-test results\\nare shown in Table 1. Analysis of a urine specimen\\nrevealed glucose (2+) and was otherwise normal.\\nSpecimens of blood and urine were obtained for\\nculture. A chest radiograph showed an endotra-\\ncheal tube in the trachea, with the tip at the level\\nof the carina; low lung volumes with bibasilar\\nsubsegmental atelectasis; and a nasogastric tube in\\nthe stomach. The patient intermittently attempted\\nto sit up; propofol was administered as needed\\nfor sedation. She was admitted to the medical\\nintensive care unit. Blood specimens were sent to\\nthe Massachusetts State Laboratory Institute for\\ntesting for evidence of infection with eastern\\nequine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus.\\nVancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, dexametha-\\nsone, acyclovir, and phenytoin were continued;\\ninsulin for hyperglycemia was administered on a\\nsliding scale; dalteparin and esomeprazole were\\nbegun. Acetaminophen was administered as\\nneeded for fever, and potassium chloride, mag-\\nnesium sulfate, and calcium gluconate were\\ngiven intravenously.\\nDuring the first hospital day, the maximum\\ntemperature was 38.7°C. The pupils were 1 mm in\\ndiameter and minimally reactive to light; the neck\\nwas supple. There were 2+ deep-tendon reflexes in\\nthe arms; other reflexes were absent, and the plan-\\ntar responses were flexor; the remainder of the\\nexamination was normal. When propofol was\\ntransiently withheld, the patient moved all limbs\\nand appeared agitated. Another lumbar puncture\\nwas performed (Table 2).\\nOn the second hospital day, continuous elec-\\ntroencephalographic monitoring revealed epilep-\\ntiform activity that resolved after propofol was\\ndiscontinued, and boluses of lorazepam and fos-\\nphenytoin, followed by levetiracetam, were admin-\\nistered. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the\\nbrain, performed without the administration of\\ncontrast material, showed areas of hyperintensity\\non fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) im-\\nages, with mild mass effect in both cerebellar\\nhemispheres, the left thalamus, the left insula, and\\nthe left basal ganglia. Most of the lesions had\\nnormal-to-decreased diffusion. There was no evi-\\ndence of intracranial hemorrhage. Swabs of the\\nthroat and rectum were obtained for viral cultures,\\nand droplet precautions were discontinued. Ex-\\namination revealed extensor posturing of the\\narms, purposeful withdrawal of the legs in re-\\nsponse to painful stimuli, brisk reflexes, and clo-\\nnus of 8 to 12 beats in the feet; the Babinski sign\\nwas present, with an extensor plantar reflex. An\\ninsulin infusion was initiated, and the use of hy-\\npotonic intravenous solutions was discontinued.\\nThe temperature rose to 39.2°C, and a cooling\\nblanket was applied.\\nOn the third hospital day, there was extensor\\nposturing of all limbs, corneal reflexes were\\ndecreased, and cold caloric testing of the left ear\\nrevealed a minimal horizontal movement of the\\neyes. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1.\\nHypertonic saline and mannitol were infused, and\\nan intracranial-pressure monitoring bolt was in-\\nserted. Another MRI scan of the brain showed no\\nchange. The maximum temperature was 39.9°C.\\nOn the fourth hospital day, the result of a\\ndiagnostic test was received.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDr. Martin S. Hirsch: May we review the imaging\\nstudies?\\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: An MRI scan of the brain,\\nobtained without the administration of contrast\\nmaterial, shows hyperintensity on FLAIR images\\nin the temporal, frontal, parietal, and occipital\\ncortex and subcortical white matter (greater on\\nthe left than on the right), in both cerebellar hemi-\\nspheres, and in the left thalamus, the left insula,\\nand the left basal ganglia (Fig. 1). Most of the\\nlesions have mild mass effect and normal-to-\\ndecreased diffusion.\\nThe differential diagnosis of diffuse abnor-\\nmalities in the deep gray nuclei and cortical-sub-\\ncortical areas with mild mass effect includes viral\\nencephalitis, subacute hypoxic-ischemic injury,\\nmultifocal infiltrating glioma, and paraneoplas-\\ntic limbic encephalitis.\\nDr. Hirsch: To most people, summertime in\\nMassachusetts brings thoughts of the beach, boat-\\ning, and swimming. To those of us in the infec-\\ntious diseases community, it also brings thoughts\\nof arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) diseases.\\nWhen a febrile illness characterized by headache,\\nneck stiffness, confusion, and increasing lethargy\\nprogressing to coma develops in a previously\\nhealthy 52-year-old woman from a rural, wooded\\narea near wetlands in southeastern Massachusetts,\\nthoughts of arbovirus encephalitis become para-\\nmount.\\nAlthough the clinical findings strongly suggest\\nviral encephalitis, initially, it is important to con-\\ntemplate a broad differential diagnosis, so that\\npotentially life-threatening but treatable condi-\\ntions are ruled out. Noninfectious causes, such as\\nstroke or brain tumor, need to be considered in\\nany patient with progressive neurologic dysfunc-\\ntion, but the inflammatory features of this pa-\\ntient\\'s cerebrospinal fluid, together with the re-\\nsults of her electroencephalographic and brain\\nimaging studies, make these diagnoses highly\\nunlikely.\\nIt is far more likely that an acute infection\\nof the central nervous system developed in this\\nwoman. Although epidemiologic and clinical\\nfactors force us to think about arboviral en-\\ncephalitides, we should first consider other treat-\\nable causes of infections of the central nervous\\nsystem.\\nBACTERIAL INFECTIONS\\nAcute bacterial meningitis must always be ruled\\nout when a febrile illness is complicated by head-\\nache, stiff neck, and rapidly progressive neurolog-\\nic signs and symptoms. In this case, it was appro-\\npriate to begin broad-spectrum antibiotics on\\nadmission to cover the major potential bacterial\\npathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae, Neis-\\nseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Lis-\\nteria monocytogenes. However, the findings on analy-\\nsis of cerebrospinal fluid (relatively normal glucose\\nlevel, relative lymphocytosis, a negative Gram\\'s\\nstain, and negative bacterial cultures for the first\\n3 days of hospitalization) make this diagnosis\\nunlikely.\\nCould this syndrome be a manifestation of\\nearly Lyme disease of the central nervous system?\\nInfection with B. burgdorferi is common in rural\\nMassachusetts during the summer, and although\\nthe patient had no known exposures to ticks, such\\nexposure often goes unrecognized. Although such\\ncases are rare, neurologic features can be the first\\nmanifestations of Lyme disease, and the classic\\nfindings of erythema migrans and arthritis may\\nbe absent. However, the principal early neurologic\\nmanifestations of Lyme disease are meningitis,\\ncranial neuropathy, and radiculoneuropathy.1,2\\nA fulminant encephalitis, as seen in this woman,\\nwould be distinctly unusual. However, since neu-\\nroborreliosis is potentially treatable, testing of ce-\\nrebrospinal fluid for B. burgdorferi DNA or anti-\\nbodies is appropriate.\\nSeveral other bacterial infections, including\\nsyphilis, leptospirosis, and tuberculosis, as well\\nas fungal infections, do not seem likely, given the\\npace of the disease, the findings on analysis of\\ncerebrospinal fluid, and neuroradiologic manifes-\\ntations. Parameningeal foci of infection, includ-\\ning brain abscess, also seem highly unlikely in\\nview of the diffuse nature of the MRI results.\\nVIRAL INFECTIONS\\nCentral nervous system manifestations may com-\\nplicate enterovirus infections during the summer.\\nHowever, self-limited aseptic meningitis is the most\\nfrequent neurologic manifestation of enterovirus\\ninfection, and encephalitis is unusual. Other viral\\ninfections, including mumps, human immuno-\\ndeficiency virus type 1 infection, and lymphocytic\\nchoriomeningitis, may cause encephalitis, but there\\nis no epidemiologic or clinical evidence of any of\\nthese infections in this patient.\\nHaving eliminated several potential causes of\\nthis woman\\'s illness, I shall concentrate on what\\nappear to be the most likely diagnoses: HSV and\\ntwo arboviruses West Nile virus and eastern\\nequine encephalitis virus.\\nHerpes Simplex Virus\\nHSV encephalitis is the most frequently recognized\\nform of sporadic encephalitis in the United States,\\nand much progress has been made in the devel-\\nopment of both techniques for early detection and\\neffective treatments.3,4 In this case, it was appro-\\npriate to begin acyclovir therapy pending the re-\\nsults of diagnostic testing. However, neuroimag-\\ning and electroencephalography usually point to\\nthe temporal lobes in this disorder, and lesions\\nare rarely seen in basal ganglia and the cerebel-\\nlum.4 Most important, the nucleic acid amplifica-\\ntion test for HSV types 1 and 2 in the cerebrospi-\\nnal fluid, a highly sensitive and specific assay,3\\nwas negative, making this diagnosis highly un-\\nlikely.\\nArboviruses\\nSeveral features in the history strongly suggest an\\narbovirus infection. These include residence in a\\nrural, wooded area near wetlands in southeastern\\nMassachusetts, a history of time spent outdoors,\\nrecent mosquito bites, and aerial spraying of the\\narea because of mammal-biting mosquitoes car-\\nrying the eastern equine encephalitis virus. More-\\nover, what appeared to be insect bites were noted\\non the patient\\'s skin on admission. If she had\\ntraveled to other parts of the United States or out-\\nside the country, the differential diagnosis would\\nbe considerably broadened.5 However, we are told\\nthat she had not traveled outside Massachusetts\\nduring the preceding 10 months or internation-\\nally in more than 5 years. Under those circum-\\nstances, our consideration of possible arbovirus-\\nes narrows to two candidates.\\nWest Nile Virus\\nSeveral features of this patient\\'s illness are com-\\npatible with encephalitis resulting from infection\\nwith West Nile virus, an RNA flavivirus of the\\nJapanese encephalitis subgroup. An enzootic sys-\\ntem between mosquitoes and birds maintains and\\namplifies West Nile virus; mammals, including\\nhorses and humans, are incidental “dead-end\"\\nhosts. Since its recognition in 1999,7 West Nile\\nvirus has spread through migratory birds across\\nNorth America, resulting in the largest outbreaks\\nof arbovirus encephalitis in U.S. history. Neuro-\\nlogic diseases associated with West Nile virus,\\nincluding meningitis, encephalitis, and a combi-\\nnation of the two, are seen most often among the\\nelderly and people who are immunocompromised.8\\nClinical manifestations of West Nile virus enceph-\\nalitis include fever, headache, and altered mental\\nstatus. Tremors, myoclonus, cranial-nerve palsies,\\nand movement disorders also occur, although sei-\\nzures are unusual. Acute flaccid paralysis identi-\\ncal to that seen during poliovirus infections has\\nalso been described.º Electroencephalographic ab-\\nnormalities may include generalized slowing, as\\nseen in this case, and neuroimaging studies are\\noften normal, particularly early in the course of the\\ndisease, in contrast to the findings in this case.8\\nIsolates of this virus are now recovered annu-\\nally in Massachusetts; discussions of two cases\\nof West Nile virus encephalitis have been pub-\\nlished in the Journal. 10,11 Thus, we must strongly\\nconsider this possibility and assume that the ce-\\nrebrospinal fluid specimens sent out to be tested\\nfor the virus will be informative.\\nEastern Equine Encephalitis Virus\\nEastern equine encephalitis virus is the most\\nneuropathogenic arbovirus transmitted in the\\nUnited States. An enzootic amplification cycle is\\nmaintained between birds and Culiseta melanura\\nmosquitoes in shaded swampy areas of eastern\\nNorth America, with various mosquito species\\nserving as bridge vectors to susceptible mammals\\n(Fig. 2). Cases of eastern equine encephalitis in\\nhumans generally occur in the Northeast between\\nJuly and October.12 This woman lived in a wood-\\ned area, spent time outdoors, had received mos-\\nquito bites, and had cutaneous lesions that were\\nconsistent with bites, so we can assume it was\\nsummer or early autumn.\\nIncubation periods generally exceed 1 week and\\nare followed by a prodrome of fever, headache,\\nand other influenza-like symptoms, similar to\\nthose in this patient. Once neurologic manifes-\\ntations develop, deterioration is rapid.13 Seizures\\nand focal neurologic signs, including cranial-nerve\\npalsies, are common, as are peripheral-blood leu-\\nkocytosis and hyponatremia. Neutrophil-predom-\\ninant pleocytosis and elevated protein levels are\\noften found in the cerebrospinal fluid, whereas\\nglucose levels are normal. Electroencephalogra-\\nphy initially shows generalized slowing; later, lat-\\neralizing epileptiform discharges may be seen, as\\nin this case.13 MRI shows areas of increased sig-\\nnal intensity, often unilateral or asymmetric, most\\ncommonly in the basal ganglia and the thalamus;\\nmass effect can be observed with large lesions,\\nas in this case.13\\nThe diagnosis is generally made on detection\\nof IgM antibodies specific to eastern equine en-\\ncephalitis in the cerebrospinal fluid, although de-\\ntection of viral RNA or antigen in appropriate\\nspecimens is also possible. Increases in serum\\nlevels of antibodies specific to the virus confirm\\nthe diagnosis.\\nSUMMARY\\nIn this case, all the epidemiologic and clinical\\nfindings suggest the diagnosis of infection with\\neastern equine encephalitis virus, although I can-\\nnot rule out a severe case of encephalitis caused\\nby infection with West Nile virus. I cannot differ-\\nentiate these two entities clinically, except that\\neastern equine encephalitis tends to be more se-\\nvere than West Nile virus encephalitis. I believe\\nthat the results of the diagnostic test received on\\nday 4 were an abnormality observed in the cere-\\nbrospinal fluid that confirms the diagnosis of\\neastern equine encephalitis.\\nDr. Eric S. Rosenberg (Pathology): Dr. Ning, what\\nwere your impressions when you initially evalu-\\nated this patient?\\nDr. Ming-Ming Ning (Neurology): The neurology\\nteam\\'s impression was that of a diffuse cerebro-\\ncortical injury that resulted in cortical irritation,\\nwhich resulted in seizure; thalamic involvement\\nwas also contributing to the patient\\'s obtunda-\\ntion. Because of the rapid progression of the\\nillness, the patient\\'s poor neurologic status, and\\nthe fact that she was young, immunocompetent,\\nand living in a region where arborvirus infection\\nis endemic, we suspected a rapidly progressive\\narbovirus encephalitis, such as eastern equine\\nencephalitis. HSV encephalitis appeared to be less\\nlikely, because even with extensive multifocal corti-\\ncal involvement, there was no hemorrhage, which\\nis atypical for HSV.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nEastern equine encephalitis.\\nDR. MARTIN S. HIRSCH\\'S DIAGNOSIS\\nEastern equine encephalitis.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDr. John A. Branda: Specimens of blood and cere-\\nbrospinal fluid obtained on admission were neg-\\native for antibodies against West Nile virus, and\\ntesting for serum antibody to B. burgdorferi was\\nnegative. Nucleic acid testing of cerebrospinal flu-\\nid was negative for enteroviral RNA, West Nile vi-\\nrus RNA, and B. burgdorferi DNA.\\nCerebrospinal fluid specimens submitted from\\nthe other hospital the day before admission to\\nthis hospital and cerebrospinal fluid and serum\\nsamples obtained on admission to this hospital\\nwere positive for IgM antibodies to eastern equine\\nencephalitis virus, negative for IgG antibodies\\n(testing performed on serum only), and positive\\nfor eastern equine encephalitis nucleic acid (test-\\ning performed on cerebrospinal fluid only). To\\nconfirm the specificity of the antibody for east-\\nern equine encephalitis virus, a plaque-reduction\\nneutralization test was performed on a serum\\nspecimen, and it was positive. These laboratory\\nresults confirmed the diagnosis of eastern equine\\nencephalitis viral infection.\\nDr. Rosenberg: Dr. DeMaria, will you describe\\nthe epidemiology of eastern equine encephalitis\\nin Massachusetts?\\nDr. Alfred DeMaria, Jr.: The year that this patient\\nacquired eastern equine encephalitis was the third\\nconsecutive year in which the number of cases\\nin humans had increased in Massachusetts (Ta-\\nble 3). From 2004 through 2006, a total of 13\\ncases of eastern equine encephalitis occurred in\\nthe state, with 6 deaths. Infections were acquired\\nin the southeastern part of the state, which has\\nthe largest area of white cedar-red maple swamp\\nthe habitat of the C. melanura mosquito and the\\nmigratory birds that are the intermediate host\\nfor the virus. 14,15 Although the first cases in\\nhorses were noted in Massachusetts in 1831, the\\nfirst outbreak in humans was not reported until\\n1938. In the 19th century, white cedars were de-\\npleted for shingle production, and there was a\\nreduction in the C. melanura habitat, but in the 20th\\ncentury, with the introduction of asphalt shin-\\ngles, the white cedar wetlands resumed growth,\\npossibly facilitating an increase in cases of east-\\nern equine encephalitis.16 For reasons that are not\\nentirely clear, cases of eastern equine encephalitis\\nin humans in Massachusetts occur in cycles lasting\\n2 to 3 years every 10 to 20 years (Table 3).12,14,15\\nThe increase in cases shortly before this pa-\\ntient became ill led to the aerial application of\\nphenothrin, a synthetic pyrethroid pesticide, over\\na wide area of southeastern Massachusetts to re-\\nduce the number of infected adult mosquitoes and\\nthus the risk of human infection. Symptoms de-\\nveloped in this patient almost simultaneously with\\nthe aerial application of pesticide, so she had pre-\\nsumably been exposed to an infected mosquito\\nbefore the spraying of her community. In addition\\nto aerial spraying, effective personal protective\\nmeasures that should be reinforced by health care\\nprofessionals include avoidance of outdoor activ-\\nity at dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are most\\nactive; consistent, correct, and careful use of re-\\npellents; and reduction of mosquito-breeding sites\\naround the home.\\nDr. Rosenberg: Dr. Buonanno, how is the pa-\\ntient?\\nDr. Ferdinando S. Buonanno (Neurology): On hos-\\npital day 25, the patient was discharged to a re-\\nhabilitation hospital. I saw her in my office about\\n5 months after discharge, and at that time, she\\nremained severely impaired. Despite psychostim-\\nulants such as amantadine and high doses of\\nmethylphenidate, she was stuporous but arous-\\nable. She remained spastic and hypertonic, with\\nunsustained clonus. She would open her eyes but\\nthen drift off to sleep immediately. She did not\\nvocalize during the visit.\\nDr. Thomas R. Spitzer (Hematology-Oncology):\\nAre there any promising advances in antiviral\\ntherapy?\\nDr. Hirsch: There are no approved antiviral agents\\nfor either West Nile virus or eastern equine en-\\ncephalitis virus. Trials have been conducted or\\nare under way for the treatment of infection with\\nWest Nile virus, using agents such as interferons\\nand hyperimmune globulins. However, since east-\\nern equine encephalitis is so uncommon, there has\\nnot been much incentive to develop drugs that are\\nactive against this virus.', 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"WORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE)\\nDISEASE_NAME: Eastern Equine Encephalitis\\n1) Information Gathering:\\n*   **Age:** 52 years old\\n*   **Symptoms:** Fever, confusion, headache, neck stiffness, myalgias, tingling of the tongue, fatigue, lethargy, tenderness over the mastoid, seizures, coma, extensor posturing, decreased reflexes, and hypertonia.\\n*   **Duration:** Symptoms developed over 9 days, progressing rapidly to coma.\\n*   **Location:** Southeastern Massachusetts, wooded area with wetlands.\\n*   **Exposure:** Possible unpasteurized cheese consumption, mosquito bites, and aerial spraying of the community.\\n*   **Relevant Comorbidities/Medications:** None mentioned.\\n*   **Red Flags:** Rapid progression to coma, seizures, altered mental status, neck stiffness, and neurological signs (hypertonia, extensor posturing, decreased reflexes).\\n\\n2) Hypothesis Generation:\\n*   **Systemic:**\\n    *   Infectious: Arbovirus encephalitis (EEE, WNV, or other mosquito-borne virus).

Six days earlier, he was evaluated in the emergency department of\\nthis hospital. He had recently had an upper respiratory infection and nasal conges-\\ntion, for which he was taking pseudoephedrine. The vital signs and general physical\\nexamination were normal. He was referred to the emergency department of the\\nMEEI. He rated the discomfort of the right eye as 2 to 3 on a scale of 0 to 5, where\\n5 is the most severe. Visual acuity, with eyeglasses, was 20/50 in the right eye and\\n20/20 in the left eye. The pupils were 4 mm in diameter. Motility was normal, as were\\nthe results of a confrontational visual-field examination (whereby the examiner\\nsits directly in front of the patient, who, with one eye covered, is asked to look at\\nthe examiner's eye and announce when the examiner's hand is visible as it moves\\nfrom the periphery toward fixation) and a slit-lamp examination. A diagnosis of\\nblepharitis was made, and treatment with warm compresses was recommended.\\nDuring the next 5 days, visual acuity in the right eye gradually decreased, and the\\npatient felt mild discomfort with movement of the eye. Nasal congestion and head-\\nache persisted, and he continued to take pseudoephedrine. One day before admis-\\nsion, he returned to the emergency department of the MEEI. He again rated the\\ndiscomfort of the right eye as 2 to 3. On reexamination, the blood pressure was\\n150/83 mm Hg and the pulse 104 beats per minute. Visual acuity, with eyeglasses,\\nwas 20/60 +1 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Both pupils constricted\\nmore after illumination of the left eye than after illumination of the right eye (indi-\\ncating a relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye). Motility and a confronta-\\ntional visual-field examination were normal in both eyes, and applanation tonometry\\nrevealed intraocular pressures of 16 mm Hg on the right and 17 mm Hg on the left.\\nOn funduscopic examination, the optic nerve of the right eye appeared swollen.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, obtained before and after the admin-\\nistration of gadolinium, revealed bilateral nasal polypoid lesions, a finding consis-\\ntent with inflammatory polyps, mucosal thick-\\nening in all paranasal sinuses, and expansion of\\na left anterior ethmoid air cell, thought to repre-\\nsent a mucocele. The left aspect of the bony sella\\nwas elevated, with superior displacement of the\\nnormal-appearing pituitary gland, which abutted\\nthe optic chiasm. No signal abnormality was\\nnoted in the optic nerves on T₂-weighted images.\\nThere was no enhancement along the course of\\nthe optic nerves. Intranasal corticosteroids and\\na tapering course of methylprednisolone were\\nbegun. The next day, the patient was seen by the\\nNeuro-Ophthalmology Service.\\nThe patient did not have rashes, fevers, myal-\\ngias, numbness, weakness, or ataxia. He had had\\nchronic sinusitis for approximately 5 years. He was\\nborn in India and had immigrated to the United\\nStates 2 years earlier. Medications included pseudo-\\nephedrine, intranasal steroids, and methylpredni-\\nsolone. He had no allergies to medications, and he\\ndid not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.\\nOn examination, the patient was alert, orient-\\ned, and cooperative. There was nasal congestion\\nand copious discharge. The best corrected visual\\nacuities were 20/40 in the right eye and 20/15 in\\nthe left eye, with no improvement with pinhole\\ntesting (viewing the chart through a pinhole).\\nResults of the Ishihara color-vision test revealed\\nthat he was colorblind in the right eye and had\\nnormal color vision in the left eye. Testing with\\nthe use of an Amsler grid showed diffuse meta-\\nmorphopsia (distortion of the straight lines of the\\ngrid) on the right. The pupils were equal in size,\\nand constricted in response to light and while\\nfocusing on an approaching object (near stimu-\\nlus). The right relative afferent pupillary defect\\nwas again demonstrated. External examination of\\nthe eyes and orbits was normal. The eyelids were\\nin normal position and ocular motility was nor-\\nmal. The slit-lamp examination revealed normal\\nanterior segments bilaterally. Applanation tonom-\\netry revealed pressures of 17 mm Hg in both eyes.\\nAutomated perimetry testing (also known as Hum-\\nphrey visual-field testing) was performed reliably\\nin both eyes and was normal in the left eye. The\\nright eye showed a diffusely decreased visual\\nfield with an area of relative sparing superona-\\nsally. Stereoscopic funduscopy performed while\\nthe pupils were dilated revealed swelling of the\\nright optic nerve, more prominent nasally than\\ntemporally. There were no optociliary collateral\\nvessels. The left optic nerve was normal. The\\nmaculae and mid-peripheral retinas were normal\\nin both eyes.\\nThe next day, computed tomography (CT) of\\nthe orbits and sinuses, performed after the ad-\\nministration of contrast material, revealed exten-\\nsive radiodense material in the paranasal sinuses,\\nthe ethmoid air cells, and the sphenoid sinuses,\\nwith expansion of ethmoid air cells and the sphe-\\nnoid sinuses. There was erosion of both optic\\ncanals, the floor of the sphenoid sinus, and the\\nsella turcica. There was mass effect on the pitu-\\nitary gland, which was displaced superiorly and\\nto the right by the expanded left sphenoid sinus.\\nThe next day, the patient was admitted to the\\nMEEI and a diagnostic procedure was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDr. Dean M. Cestari: I participated in this patient's\\ncare and am aware of the diagnosis.\\nAPPROACH TO A PATIENT WITH LOSS OF VISION\\nWhen a patient such as this one presents with\\nblurred vision, the first and most important task\\nis to determine whether the vision loss is optical\\n(i.e., refractive) or related to an ophthalmic, med-\\nical, or neurologic disorder. If the visual acuity im-\\nproves when the patient looks through a pinhole,\\nit means that the vision loss is caused by optical\\nor refractive error. If the vision loss is not cor-\\nrected by using the pinhole, the patient needs a\\nmore thorough evaluation, since a lack of improve-\\nment may indicate a more serious ophthalmic or\\nneurologic process. We do not have a record of\\nwhether pinhole testing was done during the pa-\\ntient's initial visits to the emergency department;\\nhowever, his visual acuity did not improve when\\nhe looked through a pinhole during my examina-\\ntion, raising the possibility that the vision loss was\\nof retinal or neurologic origin.\\nLOCALIZATION OF THE LESION\\nThe next step is to localize the defect within the\\nvisual pathway, which includes prechiasmal com-\\nponents (e.g., the retina and optic nerve), the optic\\nchiasm, and the postchiasmal structures (e.g., the\\noptic tract, lateral geniculate nucleus, optic radia-\\ntion, and striate cortex), by assessing visual acuity,\\ncolor vision, pupillary function, the appearance of\\nthe fundus, and visual fields.\\nA unilateral prechiasmal lesion can reduce vi-\\nsual acuity, but only when both the crossing and\\nnoncrossing fibers are affected.1 Therefore, it is\\nimportant to remember that visual acuity is not\\nalways a sensitive test of optic-nerve function\\nand that it may remain normal in the setting of a\\nprofound optic neuropathy. In this patient, a uni-\\nlateral decrease in acuity with dyschromatopsia\\n(acquired loss of color vision) was present, strong-\\nly implicating the optic nerve. Newly acquired\\nipsilateral dyschromatopsia is a very sensitive in-\\ndicator of optic-nerve dysfunction and, as in this\\npatient, usually indicates the presence of an ac-\\nquired optic neuropathy.\\nPerhaps more important, this patient's right\\neye had a relative afferent pupillary defect - one\\nof the most highly localizing signs in all of neu-\\nrology. During the swinging-flashlight test, light\\nshone into the healthy eye causes symmetrical\\npupillary constriction. Light directed into the ab-\\nnormal eye causes bilateral pupillary dilatation,\\nbecause of the reduced neural input that reaches\\nthe pretectal region of the midbrain.² A relative\\nafferent pupillary defect is typically found in the\\npresence of a unilateral optic neuropathy and oc-\\ncasionally, but only rarely, with large macular\\nabnormalities. It is usually present ipsilateral to\\nthe side of an injured optic nerve, whereas a post-\\nchiasmal optic-tract lesion will cause a contralat-\\neral relative afferent pupillary defect. The neuro-\\nophthalmic findings in this patient are consistent\\nwith a right optic neuropathy.\\nThe natural history and specific patterns of\\nvisual-field loss are perhaps the most useful\\nmeans of localizing lesions in the visual path-\\nways. Acute visual-field loss is typical of vascular\\nand demyelinating events. A gradual, progressive\\nloss of visual acuity, visual field, or both is typi-\\ncal of slowly growing compressive lesions. In this\\nsetting, monocular visual-field defects generally\\nindicate involvement of the optic nerve. Chiasmal\\ninvolvement produces a temporal defect in both\\neyes, whereas homonymous hemianopic visual-\\nfield defects with normal visual acuity are the\\nhallmark of a unilateral retrochiasmal lesion.\\nThis patient had a unilateral visual-field defect,\\nwhich had apparently progressed over a period of\\n8 days, consistent with an optic neuropathy. This\\nfinding alone is not sufficient to confidently make\\na clinical diagnosis of an optic neuropathy.\\nFinally, the appearance of the optic nerve on\\nophthalmoscopic examination differs according\\nto the site of injury. Compressive lesions can cause\\nchronic optic-disk swelling or atrophy. Optic-nerve\\npallor may develop with any lesion of the afferent\\npathway that is presynaptic to the lateral genicu-\\nlate nucleus, since the axons of the retinal gan-\\nglion cells extend from the retina to the lateral\\ngeniculate nucleus via the optic nerve. This patient\\nhad swelling of the right optic disk, consistent\\nwith an optic neuropathy.\\nOverall, this 26-year-old man presented with\\nprogressive loss of vision in the right eye over a\\nperiod of 1 week, periorbital pain, decreased vi-\\nsual acuity, dyschromatopsia, a relative afferent\\npupillary defect, a swollen optic nerve, and a gen-\\neralized reduction of sensitivity on automated\\nright visual-field testing. The combination of these\\nfindings localizes this problem to the right optic\\nnerve.\\nOPTIC NEUROPATHY\\nGlaucoma\\nThe most common cause of an optic neuropathy\\nin the general population is open-angle glaucoma;\\nit is often asymptomatic and results in slowly pro-\\ngressive peripheral visual-field constriction over\\na period of years. Central acuity is not affected\\nuntil late in the course of the disease. The acute\\nloss of vision, dyschromatopsia, swelling of the\\noptic nerve, and the normal intraocular pressure\\nrule out this diagnosis.\\nOptic Neuritis\\nOptic neuritis - inflammation of the optic nerve,\\nusually associated with demyelination is an\\nimportant consideration in this patient, since it\\nis by far the most frequent cause of optic-nerve\\ndysfunction in young adults. Although it is most\\ncommon in patients with multiple sclerosis, it may\\noccur as an isolated phenomenon; when it does,\\nit is often followed by the development of multi-\\nple sclerosis. Although it presents with many fea-\\ntures that this patient had loss of central vi-\\nsion, pain with eye movement, dyschromatopsia,\\na relative afferent pupillary defect (when unilat-\\neral), visual-field loss, and swelling of the optic\\ndisk (in one third of cases) — it usually develops\\nmore quickly, over several hours to days. None-\\ntheless, this patient's clinical history and exami-\\nnation findings are consistent with optic neuritis.\\nMRI will be useful in ruling out this diagnosis,\\nsince it should show intrinsic abnormalities of\\nthe optic nerve.3\\nIschemic Optic Neuropathy\\nThe next most common optic neuropathy is ante-\\nrior ischemic optic neuropathy; this is character-\\nized by swelling of the optic disk and peripapil-\\nlary hemorrhages that are visible on funduscopic\\nexamination. It can be divided into arteritic (asso-\\nciated with giant-cell arteritis) and nonarteritic.\\nTypically, there is painless loss of vision with dys-\\nchromatopsia and a relative afferent pupillary de-\\nfect. Visual-field defects are universal and tend to\\ninvolve the lower portion of the field. This pa-\\ntient's age, ethnic background, and periorbital\\npain are atypical for this diagnosis.\\nCompressive and Infiltrative Optic Neuropathies\\nIn addition to intracranial lesions such as menin-\\ngiomas and pituitary adenomas, lesions of the\\norbit, optic canal, or sinuses (by direct extension)\\nmay compress the optic nerve, resulting in an op-\\ntic neuropathy, with or without disk swelling (Ta-\\nble 1). In most cases of anterior compressive optic\\nneuropathy, progressive visual loss is associated\\nwith proptosis. Visual loss tends to be gradual\\nover a period of months or even years when it is\\ndue to a slow-growing lesion such as a menin-\\ngioma. When visual loss is acute, as it was in this\\ncase, it is most often because of an infectious\\ncause such as severe sinusitis. In view of this pa-\\ntient's history of severe sinusitis and the presence\\nof decreased visual acuity, dyschromatopsia, visual-\\nfield abnormalities, and disk swelling accompa-\\nnied by periorbital pain, my leading diagnosis at\\nthis point was compressive optic neuropathy due\\nto a sinus infection, but other entities in the dif-\\nferential diagnosis could not be ruled out. MRI of\\nthe orbits should help to differentiate among non-\\narteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, optic\\nneuritis, and a compressive optic neuropathy. May\\nwe see the MRI?\\nDr. Mary E. Cunnane: MRI of the orbits reveals\\nno evidence of signal abnormality or enhancement\\nin the optic nerves (Fig. 1A and 1B), a finding\\nthat would be expected in optic neuritis but not\\nin anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. There is\\nopacification of the left sphenoid sinus and mu-\\ncosal thickening in the ethmoid and sphenoid\\nsinuses (Fig. 1C), with expansion of the left an-\\nterior ethmoid, indicating a mucocele. The right\\nanterior clinoid does not show normal marrow\\nsignal but, rather, shows low signal consistent\\nwith air and is thus probably pneumatized (Fig.\\n1C, arrows; and 1D). The sphenoid sinus imme-\\ndiately abutting the right optic-nerve canal also\\nshows an absence of signal on the MRI. Signal\\nvoid in a paranasal sinus may be a normal find-\\ning, reflecting normal aeration, but can also be\\ncaused by the presence of very dense material in\\nthe sinuses.\\nDr. Cestari: The MRI helped to rule out optic\\nneuritis but did not explain the findings on the\\nclinical examination, which clearly indicated a\\nright optic neuropathy. Instead, the MRI showed\\nabnormal sinuses on the left but not the right.\\nAlthough findings of hypointensities in the sinus-\\nes on T₁-weighted sequences are consistent with\\naerated sinuses, they are also typical of fungal\\nsinusitis. CT is a better means of showing this\\nabnormality.\\nDr. Cunnane: CT of the sinuses showed com-\\nplete opacification of all the paranasal sinuses\\ndue to material consistent with densely inspissat-\\ned secretions (Fig. 2A and 2B). There is expansion\\nof the walls of the sphenoid sinus and erosion\\nalong the floors of both optic-nerve canals (Fig.\\n2C and 2D, arrows). Dense secretions are a find-\\ning typical of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. The\\nmarked inspissation seen in this disease causes\\nthe increased density of the secretions on CT,\\nbut it can substantially reduce the signal intensity\\nof these secretions on MRI. In addition, asper-\\ngillus, one of the common causes of fungal sinus-\\nitis, tends to concentrate metallic ions from its\\nsurroundings, causing a paramagnetic effect that\\naccentuates the hypointensity on MRI. The com-\\nparison of the MRI and the CT indicates how much\\nmore sensitive CT is for this particular entity.\\nDr. Cestari: Because this patient was immuno-\\ncompetent, this condition was unlikely to be an\\ninvasive fungal sinusitis, and the most likely diag-\\nnosis was allergic fungal sinusitis. However, an\\ninvasive process could not be ruled out on the\\nbasis of the clinical examination alone. There-\\nfore, I asked Dr. Metson to evaluate this patient\\nfor a debulking procedure, which I hoped would\\nbe both diagnostic and curative.\\nSUMMARY\\nDr. Ralph B. Metson: This patient presented with\\nmany symptoms seen in sinusitis, including an\\nupper respiratory infection, nasal congestion, and\\nperiorbital discomfort. The findings of high den-\\nsities within the sphenoid sinuses on CT and low\\nsignal in the same region on T₂-weighted MRI\\nwere strongly suggestive of allergic fungal sinus-\\nitis. The sphenoid sinus is surrounded by the max-\\nillary branch of the trigeminal nerves, the carotid\\narteries, and the optic canals. A layer of bone\\ntypically protects the optic nerve from any disease\\nprocess in the sphenoid sinus, but if the bone is\\neroded in severe sinusitis, compression of the op-\\ntic nerve can occur. All the clinical and radiologic\\nfeatures of this case strongly suggested such a\\ncondition as the cause of the patient's visual loss.\\nTo confirm the diagnosis and to provide relief to\\nthe patient, we performed a transnasal endoscopic\\nexploration of the sphenoid sinus.\\nINTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS\\nAt time of surgery, the right nasal cavity was\\nfilled with inflammatory polyps, which were re-\\nmoved with a motorized shaver (see the video,\\navailable with the full text of this article at www.\\nnejm.org). In the sphenoid sinus, thick brown\\nmaterial with a peanut-butter-like consistency was\\nencountered, a classic finding for allergic fungal\\nsinusitis. The debris was filling the opticocarotid\\nrecess - the space between the optic nerve and\\ncarotid artery and exerting pressure against\\nthe optic nerve. This material was cleared from\\nthe sphenoid cavity, and a 5-mm area of bony\\nerosion of the optic canal, with exposure of the\\noptic nerve, was identified. The nerve itself ap-\\npeared to be intact. Once this material was re-\\nmoved, the sinuses could begin to drain and re-\\nestablish mucociliary clearance.\\nSurgical drainage of the obstructed sinus cav-\\nity is sufficient treatment for most patients with\\nallergic fungal sinusitis. Corticosteroids, either\\noral or as topical nasal sprays, are prescribed af-\\nter surgery in an attempt to control the regrowth\\nof inflammatory nasal polyps that are associated\\nwith this disease. Daily saline rinses of the nasal\\ncavity appear to be of benefit as well. The use\\nof systemic antifungal therapy or topical agents\\nhas not been shown to improve the clinical out-\\ncome in immunocompetent patients.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nAllergic fungal sinusitis with compression of the\\nright optic nerve.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDr. William C. Faquin: Microscopical evaluation of the\\nsinus contents revealed edematous polypoid frag-\\nments of tissue with an attenuated respiratory\\nepithelial lining. A marked chronic inflamma-\\ntory stromal infiltrate was present that consisted\\nof plasma cells, lymphocytes, and many eosino-\\nphils. The eosinophils had nuclei with two lobes\\nand cytoplasm with coarse granules (Fig. 3A and\\ninset). Abundant allergic, eosinophilic mucin, char-\\nacterized by thick extracellular mucin with nu-\\nmerous eosinophils, was present in the sinus\\ncontents (Fig. 3B). Charcot-Leyden crystals, a by-\\nproduct of eosinophil degranulation, were iden-\\ntified in the allergic mucin (Fig. 3B inset, arrow).\\nA silver stain revealed occasional septate fungal\\nhyphae with acute-angle branching that were\\ncompatible with aspergillus species (Fig. 3C).\\nThese features confirm the diagnosis of allergic\\nfungal sinusitis.\\nIn contrast to invasive fungal sinusitis, which\\nis a rare, acute, life-threatening condition seen\\nprimarily in immunocompromised patients, aller-\\ngic fungal sinusitis is a chronic condition that\\ntypically occurs in immunocompetent patients\\nsuch as this one.5 A variety of fungal organisms\\nthat show geographic variations in frequency have\\nbeen identified within the allergic mucin of pa-\\ntients with allergic fungal sinusitis, including\\naspergillus species and various other fungi such as\\nbipolaris, curvularia, fusarium, and alternaria.6,7\\nAllergic fungal sinusitis may be an immune reac-\\ntion to ubiquitous fungal allergens, similar to\\nallergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; how-\\never, several studies have shown that even most\\nhealthy persons without sinonasal disease have\\nevidence of fungal organisms within their nasal\\nmucin, 9-11 so the role of fungus as an initiating\\nfactor in this disorder is somewhat controver-\\nsial. 6,7,12,13\\nDr. Cestari: The day after surgery, the patient\\nnoted rapid improvement in his vision. His visual\\nacuity improved from 20/40 to 20/13, which was\\nalmost as good as that in the left eye, which was\\n20/10. Color vision completely normalized, and I\\ncould no longer detect a relative afferent pupil-\\nlary defect. His visual fields improved, showing\\nsubstantially less reduction in sensitivity.\\nA Physician: Does fungal sinusitis occur as a\\ncomplication of chronic bacterial sinusitis?\\nDr. Metson: It can occur in patients with chron-\\nic bacterial sinusitis. The common initiating fac-\\ntor for both conditions is most likely blockage of\\nthe sinuses.\\nDr. Mandakolathur R. Murali (Allergy and Immu-\\nnology): Should Wegener's granulomatosis be\\nconsidered in the differential diagnosis?\\nDr. Metson: The initial presenting findings\\ncould have been due to Wegener's granulomato-\\nsis or other granulomatous processes that can\\naffect the sinonasal tract and the eye and orbit.\\nHowever, such processes do not have hyperplas-\\ntic mucosa with polyps; rather, they have atro-\\nphic mucosa, dry membranes, crusting, and sep-\\ntal perforations.\\nDr. Cestari: For the practicing clinician, I think\\nthe take-home points for this case are as follows:\\nwhen you see a patient with loss of vision, do a\\npinhole test; when you suspect an optic neuropa-\\nthy, test for dyschromatopsia and a relative affer-\\nent pupillary defect; and always remember that\\nyour findings on physical examination are real,\\neven if they are not supported by neuroradiologic\\nfindings (MRI may miss some findings that are\\nevident on CT).\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

Six days earlier, he was evaluated in the emergency department of\\nthis hospital. He had recently had an upper respiratory infection and nasal conges-\\ntion, for which he was taking pseudoephedrine. The vital signs and general physical\\nexamination were normal. He was referred to the emergency department of the\\nMEEI. He rated the discomfort of the right eye as 2 to 3 on a scale of 0 to 5, where\\n5 is the most severe. Visual acuity, with eyeglasses, was 20/50 in the right eye and\\n20/20 in the left eye. The pupils were 4 mm in diameter. Motility was normal, as were\\nthe results of a confrontational visual-field examination (whereby the examiner\\nsits directly in front of the patient, who, with one eye covered, is asked to look at\\nthe examiner's eye and announce when the examiner's hand is visible as it moves\\nfrom the periphery toward fixation) and a slit-lamp examination. A diagnosis of\\nblepharitis was made, and treatment with warm compresses was recommended.\\nDuring the next 5 days, visual acuity in the right eye gradually decreased, and the\\npatient felt mild discomfort with movement of the eye. Nasal congestion and head-\\nache persisted, and he continued to take pseudoephedrine. One day before admis-\\nsion, he returned to the emergency department of the MEEI. He again rated the\\ndiscomfort of the right eye as 2 to 3. On reexamination, the blood pressure was\\n150/83 mm Hg and the pulse 104 beats per minute. Visual acuity, with eyeglasses,\\nwas 20/60 +1 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Both pupils constricted\\nmore after illumination of the left eye than after illumination of the right eye (indi-\\ncating a relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye). Motility and a confronta-\\ntional visual-field examination were normal in both eyes, and applanation tonometry\\nrevealed intraocular pressures of 16 mm Hg on the right and 17 mm Hg on the left.\\nOn funduscopic examination, the optic nerve of the right eye appeared swollen.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, obtained before and after the admin-\\nistration of gadolinium, revealed bilateral nasal polypoid lesions, a finding consis-\\ntent with inflammatory polyps, mucosal thick-\\nening in all paranasal sinuses, and expansion of\\na left anterior ethmoid air cell, thought to repre-\\nsent a mucocele. The left aspect of the bony sella\\nwas elevated, with superior displacement of the\\nnormal-appearing pituitary gland, which abutted\\nthe optic chiasm. No signal abnormality was\\nnoted in the optic nerves on T₂-weighted images.\\nThere was no enhancement along the course of\\nthe optic nerves.

Cestari: I participated in this patient's\\ncare and am aware of the diagnosis.\\nAPPROACH TO A PATIENT WITH LOSS OF VISION\\nWhen a patient such as this one presents with\\nblurred vision, the first and most important task\\nis to determine whether the vision loss is optical\\n(i.e., refractive) or related to an ophthalmic, med-\\nical, or neurologic disorder. If the visual acuity im-\\nproves when the patient looks through a pinhole,\\nit means that the vision loss is caused by optical\\nor refractive error. If the vision loss is not cor-\\nrected by using the pinhole, the patient needs a\\nmore thorough evaluation, since a lack of improve-\\nment may indicate a more serious ophthalmic or\\nneurologic process.

In this patient, a uni-\\nlateral decrease in acuity with dyschromatopsia\\n(acquired loss of color vision) was present, strong-\\nly implicating the optic nerve. Newly acquired\\nipsilateral dyschromatopsia is a very sensitive in-\\ndicator of optic-nerve dysfunction and, as in this\\npatient, usually indicates the presence of an ac-\\nquired optic neuropathy.\\nPerhaps more important, this patient's right\\neye had a relative afferent pupillary defect - one\\nof the most highly localizing signs in all of neu-\\nrology. During the swinging-flashlight test, light\\nshone into the healthy eye causes symmetrical\\npupillary constriction.

It is usually present ipsilateral to\\nthe side of an injured optic nerve, whereas a post-\\nchiasmal optic-tract lesion will cause a contralat-\\neral relative afferent pupillary defect. The neuro-\\nophthalmic findings in this patient are consistent\\nwith a right optic neuropathy.\\nThe natural history and specific patterns of\\nvisual-field loss are perhaps the most useful\\nmeans of localizing lesions in the visual path-\\nways. Acute visual-field loss is typical of vascular\\nand demyelinating events. A gradual, progressive\\nloss of visual acuity, visual field, or both is typi-\\ncal of slowly growing compressive lesions. In this\\nsetting, monocular visual-field defects generally\\nindicate involvement of the optic nerve. Chiasmal\\ninvolvement produces a temporal defect in both\\neyes, whereas homonymous hemianopic visual-\\nfield defects with normal visual acuity are the\\nhallmark of a unilateral retrochiasmal lesion.\\nThis patient had a unilateral visual-field defect,\\nwhich had apparently progressed over a period of\\n8 days, consistent with an optic neuropathy. This\\nfinding alone is not sufficient to confidently make\\na clinical diagnosis of an optic neuropathy.\\nFinally, the appearance of the optic nerve on\\nophthalmoscopic examination differs according\\nto the site of injury. Compressive lesions can cause\\nchronic optic-disk swelling or atrophy. Optic-nerve\\npallor may develop with any lesion of the afferent\\npathway that is presynaptic to the lateral genicu-\\nlate nucleus, since the axons of the retinal gan-\\nglion cells extend from the retina to the lateral\\ngeniculate nucleus via the optic nerve. This patient\\nhad swelling of the right optic disk, consistent\\nwith an optic neuropathy.\\nOverall, this 26-year-old man presented with\\nprogressive loss of vision in the right eye over a\\nperiod of 1 week, periorbital pain, decreased vi-\\nsual acuity, dyschromatopsia, a relative afferent\\npupillary defect, a swollen optic nerve, and a gen-\\neralized reduction of sensitivity on automated\\nright visual-field testing. The combination of these\\nfindings localizes this problem to the right optic\\nnerve.\\nOPTIC NEUROPATHY\\nGlaucoma\\nThe most common cause of an optic neuropathy\\nin the general population is open-angle glaucoma;\\nit is often asymptomatic and results in slowly pro-\\ngressive peripheral visual-field constriction over\\na period of years. Central acuity is not affected\\nuntil late in the course of the disease. The acute\\nloss of vision, dyschromatopsia, swelling of the\\noptic nerve, and the normal intraocular pressure\\nrule out this diagnosis.\\nOptic Neuritis\\nOptic neuritis - inflammation of the optic nerve,\\nusually associated with demyelination is an\\nimportant consideration in this patient, since it\\nis by far the most frequent cause of optic-nerve\\ndysfunction in young adults.

Although it presents with many fea-\\ntures that this patient had loss of central vi-\\nsion, pain with eye movement, dyschromatopsia,\\na relative afferent pupillary defect (when unilat-\\neral), visual-field loss, and swelling of the optic\\ndisk (in one third of cases) — it usually develops\\nmore quickly, over several hours to days. None-\\ntheless, this patient's clinical history and exami-\\nnation findings are consistent with optic neuritis.\\nMRI will be useful in ruling out this diagnosis,\\nsince it should show intrinsic abnormalities of\\nthe optic nerve.3\\nIschemic Optic Neuropathy\\nThe next most common optic neuropathy is ante-\\nrior ischemic optic neuropathy; this is character-\\nized by swelling of the optic disk and peripapil-\\nlary hemorrhages that are visible on funduscopic\\nexamination. It can be divided into arteritic (asso-\\nciated with giant-cell arteritis) and nonarteritic.\\nTypically, there is painless loss of vision with dys-\\nchromatopsia and a relative afferent pupillary de-\\nfect. Visual-field defects are universal and tend to\\ninvolve the lower portion of the field. This pa-\\ntient's age, ethnic background, and periorbital\\npain are atypical for this diagnosis.\\nCompressive and Infiltrative Optic Neuropathies\\nIn addition to intracranial lesions such as menin-\\ngiomas and pituitary adenomas, lesions of the\\norbit, optic canal, or sinuses (by direct extension)\\nmay compress the optic nerve, resulting in an op-\\ntic neuropathy, with or without disk swelling (Ta-\\nble 1). In most cases of anterior compressive optic\\nneuropathy, progressive visual loss is associated\\nwith proptosis. Visual loss tends to be gradual\\nover a period of months or even years when it is\\ndue to a slow-growing lesion such as a menin-\\ngioma. When visual loss is acute, as it was in this\\ncase, it is most often because of an infectious\\ncause such as severe sinusitis. In view of this pa-\\ntient's history of severe sinusitis and the presence\\nof decreased visual acuity, dyschromatopsia, visual-\\nfield abnormalities, and disk swelling accompa-\\nnied by periorbital pain, my leading diagnosis at\\nthis point was compressive optic neuropathy due\\nto a sinus infection, but other entities in the dif-\\nferential diagnosis could not be ruled out. MRI of\\nthe orbits should help to differentiate among non-\\narteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, optic\\nneuritis, and a compressive optic neuropathy. May\\nwe see the MRI?\\nDr. Mary E. Cunnane: MRI of the orbits reveals\\nno evidence of signal abnormality or enhancement\\nin the optic nerves (Fig. 1A and 1B), a finding\\nthat would be expected in optic neuritis but not\\nin anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. There is\\nopacification of the left sphenoid sinus and mu-\\ncosal thickening in the ethmoid and sphenoid\\nsinuses (Fig. 1C), with expansion of the left an-\\nterior ethmoid, indicating a mucocele. The right\\nanterior clinoid does not show normal marrow\\nsignal but, rather, shows low signal consistent\\nwith air and is thus probably pneumatized (Fig.\\n1C, arrows; and 1D). The sphenoid sinus imme-\\ndiately abutting the right optic-nerve canal also\\nshows an absence of signal on the MRI. Signal\\nvoid in a paranasal sinus may be a normal find-\\ning, reflecting normal aeration, but can also be\\ncaused by the presence of very dense material in\\nthe sinuses.\\nDr. Cestari: The MRI helped to rule out optic\\nneuritis but did not explain the findings on the\\nclinical examination, which clearly indicated a\\nright optic neuropathy. Instead, the MRI showed\\nabnormal sinuses on the left but not the right.\\nAlthough findings of hypointensities in the sinus-\\nes on T₁-weighted sequences are consistent with\\naerated sinuses, they are also typical of fungal\\nsinusitis. CT is a better means of showing this\\nabnormality.\\nDr. Cunnane: CT of the sinuses showed com-\\nplete opacification of all the paranasal sinuses\\ndue to material consistent with densely inspissat-\\ned secretions (Fig. 2A and 2B). There is expansion\\nof the walls of the sphenoid sinus and erosion\\nalong the floors of both optic-nerve canals (Fig.\\n2C and 2D, arrows). Dense secretions are a find-\\ning typical of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. The\\nmarked inspissation seen in this disease causes\\nthe increased density of the secretions on CT,\\nbut it can substantially reduce the signal intensity\\nof these secretions on MRI. In addition, asper-\\ngillus, one of the common causes of fungal sinus-\\nitis, tends to concentrate metallic ions from its\\nsurroundings, causing a paramagnetic effect that\\naccentuates the hypointensity on MRI. The com-\\nparison of the MRI and the CT indicates how much\\nmore sensitive CT is for this particular entity.\\nDr. Cestari: Because this patient was immuno-\\ncompetent, this condition was unlikely to be an\\ninvasive fungal sinusitis, and the most likely diag-\\nnosis was allergic fungal sinusitis. However, an\\ninvasive process could not be ruled out on the\\nbasis of the clinical examination alone. There-\\nfore, I asked Dr. Metson to evaluate this patient\\nfor a debulking procedure, which I hoped would\\nbe both diagnostic and curative.\\nSUMMARY\\nDr. Ralph B. Metson: This patient presented with\\nmany symptoms seen in sinusitis, including an\\nupper respiratory infection, nasal congestion, and\\nperiorbital discomfort. The findings of high den-\\nsities within the sphenoid sinuses on CT and low\\nsignal in the same region on T₂-weighted MRI\\nwere strongly suggestive of allergic fungal sinus-\\nitis. The sphenoid sinus is surrounded by the max-\\nillary branch of the trigeminal nerves, the carotid\\narteries, and the optic canals. A layer of bone\\ntypically protects the optic nerve from any disease\\nprocess in the sphenoid sinus, but if the bone is\\neroded in severe sinusitis, compression of the op-\\ntic nerve can occur. All the clinical and radiologic\\nfeatures of this case strongly suggested such a\\ncondition as the cause of the patient's visual loss.\\nTo confirm the diagnosis and to provide relief to\\nthe patient, we performed a transnasal endoscopic\\nexploration of the sphenoid sinus.\\nINTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS\\nAt time of surgery, the right nasal cavity was\\nfilled with inflammatory polyps, which were re-\\nmoved with a motorized shaver (see the video,\\navailable with the full text of this article at www.\\nnejm.org). In the sphenoid sinus, thick brown\\nmaterial with a peanut-butter-like consistency was\\nencountered, a classic finding for allergic fungal\\nsinusitis. The debris was filling the opticocarotid\\nrecess - the space between the optic nerve and\\ncarotid artery and exerting pressure against\\nthe optic nerve. This material was cleared from\\nthe sphenoid cavity, and a 5-mm area of bony\\nerosion of the optic canal, with exposure of the\\noptic nerve, was identified. The nerve itself ap-\\npeared to be intact. Once this material was re-\\nmoved, the sinuses could begin to drain and re-\\nestablish mucociliary clearance.\\nSurgical drainage of the obstructed sinus cav-\\nity is sufficient treatment for most patients with\\nallergic fungal sinusitis. Corticosteroids, either\\noral or as topical nasal sprays, are prescribed af-\\nter surgery in an attempt to control the regrowth\\nof inflammatory nasal polyps that are associated\\nwith this disease. Daily saline rinses of the nasal\\ncavity appear to be of benefit as well. The use\\nof systemic antifungal therapy or topical agents\\nhas not been shown to improve the clinical out-\\ncome in immunocompetent patients.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nAllergic fungal sinusitis with compression of the\\nright optic nerve.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDr. William C. Faquin: Microscopical evaluation of the\\nsinus contents revealed edematous polypoid frag-\\nments of tissue with an attenuated respiratory\\nepithelial lining. A marked chronic inflamma-\\ntory stromal infiltrate was present that consisted\\nof plasma cells, lymphocytes, and many eosino-\\nphils. The eosinophils had nuclei with two lobes\\nand cytoplasm with coarse granules (Fig. 3A and\\ninset). Abundant allergic, eosinophilic mucin, char-\\nacterized by thick extracellular mucin with nu-\\nmerous eosinophils, was present in the sinus\\ncontents (Fig. 3B). Charcot-Leyden crystals, a by-\\nproduct of eosinophil degranulation, were iden-\\ntified in the allergic mucin (Fig. 3B inset, arrow).\\nA silver stain revealed occasional septate fungal\\nhyphae with acute-angle branching that were\\ncompatible with aspergillus species (Fig. 3C).\\nThese features confirm the diagnosis of allergic\\nfungal sinusitis.\\nIn contrast to invasive fungal sinusitis, which\\nis a rare, acute, life-threatening condition seen\\nprimarily in immunocompromised patients, aller-\\ngic fungal sinusitis is a chronic condition that\\ntypically occurs in immunocompetent patients\\nsuch as this one.5 A variety of fungal organisms\\nthat show geographic variations in frequency have\\nbeen identified within the allergic mucin of pa-\\ntients with allergic fungal sinusitis, including\\naspergillus species and various other fungi such as\\nbipolaris, curvularia, fusarium, and alternaria.6,7\\nAllergic fungal sinusitis may be an immune reac-\\ntion to ubiquitous fungal allergens, similar to\\nallergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; how-\\never, several studies have shown that even most\\nhealthy persons without sinonasal disease have\\nevidence of fungal organisms within their nasal\\nmucin, 9-11 so the role of fungus as an initiating\\nfactor in this disorder is somewhat controver-\\nsial. 6,7,12,13\\nDr. Cestari: The day after surgery, the patient\\nnoted rapid improvement in his vision. His visual\\nacuity improved from 20/40 to 20/13, which was\\nalmost as good as that in the left eye, which was\\n20/10. Color vision completely normalized, and I\\ncould no longer detect a relative afferent pupil-\\nlary defect. His visual fields improved, showing\\nsubstantially less reduction in sensitivity.\\nA Physician: Does fungal sinusitis occur as a\\ncomplication of chronic bacterial sinusitis?\\nDr. Metson: It can occur in patients with chron-\\nic bacterial sinusitis. The common initiating fac-\\ntor for both conditions is most likely blockage of\\nthe sinuses.\\nDr. Mandakolathur R. Murali (Allergy and Immu-\\nnology): Should Wegener's granulomatosis be\\nconsidered in the differential diagnosis?\\nDr. Metson: The initial presenting findings\\ncould have been due to Wegener's granulomato-\\nsis or other granulomatous processes that can\\naffect the sinonasal tract and the eye and orbit.\\nHowever, such processes do not have hyperplas-\\ntic mucosa with polyps; rather, they have atro-\\nphic mucosa, dry membranes, crusting, and sep-\\ntal perforations.\\nDr. Cestari: For the practicing clinician, I think\\nthe take-home points for this case are as follows:\\nwhen you see a patient with loss of vision, do a\\npinhole test; when you suspect an optic neuropa-\\nthy, test for dyschromatopsia and a relative affer-\\nent pupillary defect; and always remember that\\nyour findings on physical examination are real,\\neven if they are not supported by neuroradiologic\\nfindings (MRI may miss some findings that are\\nevident on CT).\", 'images_used': [], 'answer': 'WORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Allergic fungal sinusitis with compression of the right optic nerve.\\nDISEASE_NAME: Allergic Fungal Sinusitis\\n', 'original_file': 'NEJMcpc0805311.json'}\n",

Burnett (Pediatric Dermatology): A 10.8-year-old girl was seen in the\\nPediatric Dermatology Clinic of this hospital because of recurrent oral ulcers and\\ncutaneous bullae.\\nThe patient was well until 2 years of age, when white lesions developed in the\\nmouth that were followed by vesicles and bullae on the dorsal and plantar surfaces\\nof the feet and, to a lesser degree, on the knees and hands. The white lesions on\\nthe buccal mucosa became ulcerated and painful; the other lesions were occasion-\\nally painful and pruritic. The lesions lasted 4 days to 2 weeks. Similar lesions re-\\ncurred intermittently thereafter, at intervals of approximately 3 to 4 months,\\nwithout seasonal variation or precipitant trauma.\\nAt age 6.9 years, she saw her pediatrician because of recurrent blisters on her\\nfeet, left knee, and both hands. A swab from a lesion on the toe was sent for cul-\\nture, and antibiotics were prescribed; the culture was sterile. During the following\\nweek, a pink rash developed under the arms and on the inner thighs. The patient\\nsaw a dermatologist at another facility. On examination, there were white, slight-\\nly oval plaques on the buccal mucosa that were approximately 2 to 3 cm in diam-\\neter. Tense bullae, containing clear to slightly cloudy fluid and measuring 3 to 8\\nmm in diameter, were located on the dorsum of all toes, extending slightly onto\\nthe feet (Fig. 1A); on the plantar surfaces of the toes and feet; and on the fingers\\nand palms. Several lesions were confluent. There were resolving bullae with minimal\\noverlying erythema and a slight hemorrhagic crust on the toes, and there was a re-\\nsolving bulla approximately 1 cm in diameter on the left knee (Fig. 1B). There were\\nmultiple pink-to-tan hyperkeratotic papules, 2 to 3 mm in diameter, on the upper\\nthighs and arms (Fig. 1C). There were no nail changes or scarring of the skin. Nikol-\\nsky's sign (ready removal of the epidermis with slight tangential pressure) was nega-\\ntive. Skin care to decrease local trauma and biopsy of a skin lesion for pathological\\nexamination were recommended.\\nTwo months later, a punch biopsy of the skin of the left inner arm was performed.\\nPathological examination revealed a subepidermal microvesicle. The results of im-\\nFigure 1. Cutaneous Lesions.\\nTwo years before this evaluation, numerous bullae, ulcers, and crusted lesions are present on the dorsal surfaces of\\nthe toes of the left foot (Panel A). There is a resolving bulla approximately 1 cm in diameter on the left knee (Panel B).\\nThere are multiple pink-to-tan hyperkeratotic papules, 2 to 3 mm in diameter, on the inner upper arms and axillae\\n(Panel C). Ten days after the initial evaluation at this hospital, vesicular lesions developed on both feet (Panel D).\\n(Photographs courtesy of Melissa M. Burnett, M.D., Pediatric Dermatology, Massachusetts General Hospital.)\\nmunohistochemical staining were interpreted as\\nshowing a lack of laminin-5 at the basement-\\nmembrane zone, the roof, and the floor of the\\nmicrovesicle. The findings were thought to be\\nconsistent with junctional epidermolysis bullosa,\\npossibly the Herlitz type. Genetic studies were not\\nperformed. Two years later, at age 8.9 years, she\\nwas referred to an allergist at another health\\ncare facility because of chronic sneezing, for which\\nshe was taking loratadine. Additional question-\\ning revealed that an oral rash had occurred after\\nthe consumption of mangoes, but radioallergo-\\nsorbent testing for allergy to mangoes was nega-\\ntive. Other test results included a white-cell count\\nof 14,200 cells per cubic millimeter (61% poly-\\nmorphonuclear leukocytes and 29% lymphocytes,\\nand a total eosinophil count of 748 cells per cubic\\nmillimeter). Analysis of a nasal smear revealed\\n1+ eosinophils and 3+ neutrophils. Environmen-\\ntal measures to decrease dust-mite exposure and\\ncontinued use of loratadine were recommended.\\nTreatment with antibiotics was given on sev-\\neral occasions and with famciclovir on one occa-\\nsion for suspected bacterial or viral infections,\\nwithout improvement in the lesions. At age 10.8\\nyears, she presented to the pediatric dermatology\\nclinic of this hospital.\\nThe patient had been born at a gestational age\\nof 38 weeks by emergency cesarean section and\\nweighed 5 lb 12 oz (2.6 kg) at birth. The prenatal\\ncourse had been complicated by maternal hyper-\\ntension. Routine childhood immunizations had\\nbeen administered. The patient had a seizure of\\nunknown origin at age 3 years; phenytoin was\\nadministered and later discontinued because of\\na rash. She was allergic to cephalexin, dust, and\\npollen. Her only medication was ibuprofen, as\\nneeded for pain. Her ethnic and racial background\\nwas Asian and white. Several relatives had atopy,\\nhives, and eczema, and her siblings were healthy.\\nThere was no family history of autoimmune dis-\\nease or blistering disorders. She appeared well, and\\nthe physical examination was normal, with no\\nscarring or visible abnormality of the oropharynx,\\nskin, or nails.\\nTen days after the visit, vesicular lesions devel-\\noped on both feet after the patient wore new shoes\\n(Fig. 1D). She returned to the dermatologist. Punch\\nbiopsies of skin lesions on both feet were per-\\nformed. Pathological examination with the use of\\nhematoxylin and eosin staining was interpreted\\nas showing spongiotic dermatitis with intraepi-\\ndermal vesicle formation and dyskeratosis. Stains\\nfor fungi and immunofluorescence staining for\\nIgA, IgG, IgM, C3, albumin, and fibrinogen were\\nnegative. The findings were thought to be consis-\\ntent with an eczematous process or pompholyx.\\nElectron microscopical examination showed a nor-\\nmal dermoepidermal junction with no evidence of\\nclefting, no degeneration of basal-layer keratino-\\ncytes, and normal collagen type VII. There was\\nprominent spongiosis, with occasional mononu-\\nclear inflammatory cells and necrotic keratino-\\ncytes.\\nAdditional diagnostic testing was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDr. James G.H. Dinulos: In the differential diagnosis\\nof this child with recurrent oral ulcers and cuta-\\nneous bullae, one must ask two basic questions.\\nDoes this child have a primary cutaneous disor-\\nder in which the underlying mechanism of disease\\nis directed toward the skin? Or, does this child\\nhave cutaneous manifestations of a systemic dis-\\norder? Table 1 lists the disorders in each category\\nthat need to be considered in this case.\\nIn the evaluation of this child with oral ulcer-\\nations and cutaneous bullae, several key features\\nare important to consider. These include age at\\nonset, precipitating factors, general health of the\\nchild, family history of blisters, distribution of the\\nlesions, and the nature of the blisters (e.g., an es-\\ntimation of their depth [a negative or positive\\nNikolski's sign] and a determination of whether\\nthey are recurrent or constant).\\nIn the present case, four key points should be\\nconsidered when sorting through the many con-\\nditions on the differential-diagnosis list. First, the\\nchild was healthy for the first 2 years of life, and\\nshe appeared healthy, aside from her skin lesions,\\nwhen she presented to this hospital. Second, the\\ndisease process is chronic and intermittent, and\\nacute flares last less than 2 weeks. Third, the con-\\ndition leaves no residual cutaneous effects, such as\\nscarring; and fourth, the mouth and the hands\\nand feet (acral sites) are predominantly affected.\\nThese facts narrow our list of primary cutaneous\\nconditions to epidermolysis bullosa, contact der-\\nmatitis, and pompholyx. The systemic diseases\\npresenting in the skin that should be considered\\nin this child include recurrent erythema multi-\\nforme due to herpes simplex virus, Behçet's syn-\\ndrome, and gastrointestinal disorders such as\\nCrohn's disease and conditions producing malab-\\nsorption (e.g., cystic fibrosis and acrodermatitis\\nenteropathica).\\nEPIDERMOLYSIS BULLOSA\\nEpidermolysis bullosa, a group of inherited skin\\ndisorders characterized by skin fragility,¹ in which\\nbullae occur as a result of alterations in proteins\\nthat are critical for maintaining skin integrity, is\\nan important consideration in this case. Severe\\nforms of epidermolysis bullosa such as junctional\\nepidermolysis bullosa, which typically present at\\nbirth or in the newborn period, are unlikely, since\\nthis patient did not have blisters until the age of\\n2 years. A milder form, such as epidermolysis\\nbullosa simplex (the Weber-Cockayne variant),\\nwhich can present later in childhood and adoles-\\ncence with recurrent blisters on the legs, should\\nbe considered. Nonetheless, a biopsy specimen of\\na subepidermal blister was reported to show com-\\nplete absence of laminin-5, suggesting a severe\\nform of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, the Her-\\nlitz variant. Although there is great clinical and\\ngenetic heterogeneity in junctional epidermolysis\\nbullosa, severely affected patients die in infancy\\nbecause of widespread blistering; although mildly\\naffected patients survive, they have lifelong and\\npersistent blistering.2,3 In view of this patient's\\nclinical course, this diagnosis is unlikely, and the\\ncomplete absence of laminin-5 is probably a false\\npositive test result.\\nCONTACT DERMATITIS\\nContact allergens do not frequently cause oral ul-\\ncerations, such as those seen in this patient, al-\\nthough cinnamon mints, potassium dicyanoaurate,\\nnickel sulfate, and gold sodium may do so.4,5 A sys-\\ntemic reaction to oleoresin can produce a peri-\\noral and intertriginous rash. After this patient\\nate mangoes, a rash developed around her mouth,\\nsuggesting an allergy to oleoresin, but contact\\ndermatitis does not explain the associated inter-\\nmittent acral bullae. Contact dermatitis that leads\\nto the production of oral ulcerations that are fol-\\nlowed by intermittent acral bullae has not, to my\\nknowledge, been described. Although contact al-\\nlergy is an important consideration in this pa-\\ntient, it is not the likely diagnosis.\\nPOMPHOLYX\\nThe findings on the skin biopsy in this case were\\ninterpreted as consistent with pompholyx. This is\\na recurring condition characterized by discrete,\\nwell-defined vesicles, occurring principally on the\\nsides of the fingers and toes, which may resem-\\nble tapioca. The underlying cause is not known,\\nand although this condition is also referred to as\\ndyshidrotic eczema, there is no abnormality of\\nsweat glands. However, pompholyx does not in-\\nvolve the oral mucosa and is rare in preschool-\\nage children. Thus, this patient is not likely to have\\npompholyx.\\nRECURRENT ERYTHEMA MULTIFORME\\nThis patient's intermittent course, lesion duration\\nof about 2 weeks, oral ulcerations, and acral blis-\\nters, as well as the necrotic keratinocytes seen on\\nskin biopsy, would all be consistent with recurrent\\nerythema multiforme. Erythema multiforme is a\\nself-limited condition characterized by symmet-\\nrically distributed “target” or edematous papules,\\nvesicles, and bullae that tend to be distributed on\\nacral sites, remain for at least 7 days, and gener-\\nally heal without scarring. Many children present\\nwith oral lesions, as seen in this patient. 8,9 How-\\never, when erythema multiforme is recurrent, as\\nthe lesions are in this case, 10 it is most common-\\nly in a setting of recurrent infection with herpes\\nsimplex virus. This patient does not have a his-\\ntory of herpes simplex virus, and despite multiple\\nepisodes and physical examinations with several\\nphysicians, no classic target lesions were described.\\nFurther diagnostic testing could include testing of\\na skin lesion for herpes simplex virus nucleic acid\\nby polymerase chain reaction.11,12\\nBEHÇET'S DISEASE\\nBehçet's disease is a chronic vasculitis of unknown\\ncause that affects multiple organ systems; its ma-\\nTable 1.

Other clinical features that are considered\\nminor criteria include eye lesions (anterior or pos-\\nterior uveitis, cells in the vitreous, or retinal vascu-\\nlitis) and skin lesions (erythema nodosum, pseud-\\nofolliculitis, papulopustular lesions, or acneiform\\nlesions). Oral and genital ulcerations are seen in\\nvirtually all children with Behçet's disease.13 Our\\npatient has both oral and cutaneous lesions, but she\\nis not reported to have genital ulcerations; how-\\never, we were not told whether anyone actually per-\\nformed a complete examination of the genitalia.\\nAlthough the absence of genital ulcers argues\\nagainst a diagnosis of Behçet's disease in this case,\\na slit-lamp examination could be performed to as-\\nsist in evaluating for this diagnosis.\\nGASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS\\nGastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory\\nbowel disease are important diagnostic consider-\\nations in our patient, since gastrointestinal signs\\ncan be subtle and skin findings can precede gas-\\ntrointestinal findings. In children with asymptom-\\natic inflammatory bowel disease, extraintestinal\\nlesions are seen most commonly in the oral and\\nperianal regions and are more common in cases\\nof Crohn's disease than in cases of ulcerative coli-\\ntis.14 Oral lesions include lip swelling, gingival\\nedema, oral erosions and ulcerations, and angular\\ncheilitis. Perianal lesions include skin tags, pus-\\ntules, fissures, and abscesses. Because of the oral\\nlesions, occult Crohn's disease is an important con-\\nsideration in this patient.\\nFinally, disorders resulting in malabsorption\\nmay produce oral and acral rashes due to vitamin\\nand mineral deficiencies. Although this may oc-\\ncur in children with inflammatory bowel disease,\\nceliac disease, and cystic fibrosis, the classic ex-\\nample is acrodermatitis enteropathica due to zinc\\ndeficiency.15,16\\nACRODERMATITIS ENTEROPATHICA\\nZinc deficiency may occur as an autosomal reces-\\nsive inherited disorder due to mutations in the\\nSLC39A4 gene that encodes the zinc transporter\\nprotein ZIP4, a condition known as acrodermati-\\ntis enteropathica. Alternatively, it may occur as a\\nresult of an acquired condition that involves the\\ndefective absorption of zinc, producing an acro-\\ndermatitis enteropathica-like syndrome. Either\\nform may result in skin lesions similar to those\\nseen in this patient. The lesions in acrodermatitis\\nenteropathica are variable in appearance and in-\\nclude eczematous or psoriasiform plaques, angu-\\nlar cheilitis (i.e., perleche), and paronychia, or less\\ncommonly, vesicles and bullae; they occur on the\\narms and legs and the perigenital and perioral re-\\ngions. Without treatment, alopecia and diarrhea\\ncan develop.17 The vast majority of patients with\\ninherited zinc deficiency present during infancy:\\nsigns and symptoms of acrodermatitis develop in\\nbottle-fed infants shortly after birth, whereas in\\nbreast-fed infants the signs occur days to weeks\\nafter weaning.18 Symptoms did not develop in our\\npatient until 2 years of age, making the inherited\\nform unlikely. Acquired acrodermatitis can occur\\nin association with malabsorption syndromes,\\nextensive burns, Crohn's disease, sickle cell ane-\\nmia, celiac disease, systemic cancers, pancreatic\\ninsufficiency, renal tubular dysfunction, a defect\\nof mammary zinc secretion, short-bowel syndrome,\\ndiets high in phytates, total parenteral nutrition,\\nand prematurity. In this child, occult celiac dis-\\nease, Crohn's disease, and cystic fibrosis should\\nbe considered.\\nMy diagnosis is zinc deficiency - either acro-\\ndermatitis enteropathica or acrodermatitis entero-\\npathica-like syndrome. The diagnostic test should\\nbe a skin biopsy followed by determination of a\\nserum or plasma zinc level.\\nDr. Nancy Lee Harris (Pathology): Dr. Burnett, can\\nyou tell us your thinking at the time of the diag-\\nnostic procedures?\\nDr. Burnett: The patient carried a diagnosis of\\nepidermolysis bullosa with laminin-5 deficiency.\\nDr. Dinulos and I considered that diagnosis to be\\nunlikely, since the patient appeared well and had\\nno scarring. I considered a milder form of epider-\\nmolysis bullosa or an autoimmune bullous disor-\\nder such as bullous pemphigoid. I performed two\\npunch biopsies of affected skin, one of which was\\nprocessed for light microscopy and the other for\\nelectron microscopy.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nEpidermolysis bullosa.\\nDR. JAMES G.H. DINULOS'S\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nAcrodermatitis enteropathica or acrodermatitis en-\\nteropathica-like syndrome.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDr. Artur Zembowicz: The sections processed for rou-\\ntine histologic examination showed confluent in-\\ntraepidermal vesicles with a dense inflammatory\\ninfiltrate within intraepidermal spaces, at the der-\\nmoepidermal junction, and in the superficial retic-\\nular dermis (Fig. 2A). This process was initially\\ninterpreted as spongiotic dermatitis with dyskera-\\ntosis, a rather nonspecific pattern that can be seen\\nin cases of eczema, contact and systemic allergic\\nreactions, and a variety of other conditions. How-\\never, careful evaluation revealed that the mech-\\nanism of vesicle formation did not involve the\\naccumulation of intraepidermal fluid due to in-\\nflammation (spongiosis) but instead involved the\\ndegeneration of individual keratinocytes, with bal-\\nlooning degeneration, dyskeratosis, loss of inter-\\ncellular connections, cell necrosis, and a secondary\\ninflammatory response (Fig. 2B). Loss of kerati-\\nnocytes leads to pallor of the superficial layer of\\nthe epidermis that forms the roof of the vesicles\\n(Fig. 2A). These histologic features are consistent\\nwith epidermal changes due to a nutritional defi-\\nciency and have been described in cases of zinc\\ndeficiency associated with acrodermatitis entero-\\npathica, necrolytic migratory erythema associat-\\ned with the glucagonoma syndrome, free fatty\\nacid deficiency, and pellagra. The typical histo-\\nlogic changes present in the more common ery-\\nthematous lesions of acrodermatitis enteropathi-\\nca consist of degeneration of the surface epidermis\\nassociated with pallor on routine staining, para-\\nkeratosis, and a mild inflammatory infiltrate; the\\npseudospongiotic changes seen in this case are less\\ncommon but are characteristic of the bullous vari-\\nant acrodermatitis enteropathica.19,20 In view of\\nthe clinical picture, a bullous variant of acroder-\\nmatitis enteropathica or an acrodermatitis-like\\nsyndrome was thought to be the most likely diag-\\nnosis.\\nElectron microscopy was also performed, be-\\ncause it is useful in the evaluation of blistering\\ndisorders, especially epidermolysis bullosa and ac-\\nquired immunobullous disorders, since it allows\\nprecise determination of the level of split at the\\ndermoepidermal junction. In this case, the der-\\nmoepidermal junction had normal ultrastructure,\\nwithout evidence of bulla formation, findings that\\ndo not support the presence of either epidermoly-\\nsis bullosa or an immunobullous disease affect-\\ning the dermoepidermal junction. Subsequent test-\\ning disclosed that the serum level of zinc was\\n311 µg per liter (5 µmol per liter) (reference range,\\n670 to 1240 µg per liter [10 to 19 μmol per liter]),\\nconfirming the diagnosis of zinc deficiency.\\nThis case illustrates the diagnostic challenges\\nin recognizing zinc deficiency in children and the\\nneed for increased awareness of this readily treat-\\nable condition among pediatricians and patholo-\\ngists. The diagnosis of acrodermatitis enteropath-\\nica is often delayed for months or years, as it was\\nin this case, even when skin biopsies are per-\\nformed. The bullous variant of the disease, which\\nthis patient has, is particularly challenging, be-\\ncause it is not usually considered in the clinical\\ndifferential diagnosis of bullous diseases of child-\\nhood, and the epidermal changes seen on exami-\\nnation of skin-biopsy specimens are often mis-\\ninterpreted as spongiotic dermatitis, as initially\\nhappened in this case.20\\nDr. Burnett: After the diagnosis was made, the\\npatient was referred to a gastroenterologist. Her\\ndiet was low in red meat, but she was not a pure\\nvegetarian. She did not take any dietary supple-\\nments. She had a normal serum IgA level and did\\nnot have antibodies to gliadin or transglutami-\\nnase, which made celiac disease unlikely. She had\\nno symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, and\\nupper and lower gastrointestinal imaging dis-\\nclosed no abnormalities. A diet high in zinc and\\nover-the-counter zinc supplements were prescribed.\\nI saw her at a follow-up appointment 1 year after\\nFigure 2. Skin-Biopsy Specimen.\\nThe superficial portion of a 4-mm punch-biopsy speci-\\nmen of a lesion on the foot (Panel A) shows an irregu-\\nlar intraepidermal blister with an inflammatory infil-\\ntrate present within vesicles and in the superficial\\nreticular dermis. On higher magnification of the edge\\nof the intraepidermal vesicle (Panel B), three features\\nshow that the mechanism of blister formation is indi-\\nvidual cell degeneration and necrosis rather than in-\\nflammation (spongiosis): there are numerous dyskera-\\ntotic cells (keratinocytes undergoing apoptosis with\\nabnormal keratinization, short arrow), the intact epi-\\ndermis shows no evidence of the fluid accumulation\\nbetween keratinocytes that would be expected in spon-\\ngiotic dermatitis (arrowhead), and the inflammatory in-\\nfiltrate within the blister space is associated with rem-\\nnants of degenerated keratinocytes (long arrow).\\nthe diagnosis, and she did not report additional\\nepisodes of oral or cutaneous lesions.\\nDr. Harris: Dr. Dinulos, can you explain why this\\npatient had only intermittent symptoms, in con-\\ntrast to the severe, chronic manifestations that are\\ntypical of the hereditary form of the disease?\\nDr. Dinulos: If this patient has inherited acro-\\ndermatitis enteropathica, she may have partial en-\\nzyme activity, which in physiologic situations is\\nable to keep her free of symptoms. During periods\\nof stress, such as growth, increased zinc require-\\nments may overcome the patient's ability for zinc\\nabsorption and produce cutaneous findings.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "\n",
      "Reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Information Gathering:** The patient is a 10-year-old girl with recurrent oral ulcers and cutaneous bullae. The lesions are intermittent, lasting 4 days to 2 weeks, and occur at intervals of 3-4 months. She has a history of oral rash after mango consumption (negative allergy test), and the skin biopsy shows spongiotic dermatitis with intraepidermal vesicle formation and dyskeratosis. The patient is well-nourished, and there is no family history of blistering disorders. The zinc level is low (311 µg/L).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **System 1 (Intuitive):** The intermittent nature of the lesions, the presence of oral ulcers, and the skin biopsy findings (spongiotic dermatitis with dyskeratosis) strongly suggest a nutritional deficiency. The recurrent nature points towards a chronic condition.\n",
      "    *   **System 2 (Analytic):** The differential diagnosis includes epidermolysis bullosa, contact dermatitis, pompholyx, recurrent erythema multiforme, Behçet's syndrome, and gastrointestinal disorders. However, the lack of scarring, the negative Nikolsky's sign, and the specific biopsy findings make these diagnoses less likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Defining Features:** The key features are the recurrent oral ulcers, the cutaneous bullae, the spongiotic dermatitis with dyskeratosis on biopsy, and the low zinc level.\n",
      "    *   **Discriminatory Features:** The intermittent nature of the lesions, the lack of scarring, and the negative Nikolsky's sign help to differentiate this condition from other blistering disorders.\n",
      "    *   **Point-of-Care Tests/Labs:** A serum zinc level is the most important test to confirm the diagnosis.\n",
      "    *   **Potential Diagnostic Biases:** Anchoring to the initial biopsy interpretation (spongiotic dermatitis) could lead to overlooking the specific features of acrodermatitis enteropathica.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:** The combination of clinical findings (recurrent oral ulcers, cutaneous bullae, intermittent nature of lesions) and the low zinc level strongly supports the diagnosis of acrodermatitis enteropathica. The patient's age and the lack of severe blistering make the hereditary form less likely. The intermittent nature of the lesions is consistent with the acquired form.\n",

Burnett (Pediatric Dermatology): A 10.8-year-old girl was seen in the\\nPediatric Dermatology Clinic of this hospital because of recurrent oral ulcers and\\ncutaneous bullae.\\nThe patient was well until 2 years of age, when white lesions developed in the\\nmouth that were followed by vesicles and bullae on the dorsal and plantar surfaces\\nof the feet and, to a lesser degree, on the knees and hands. The white lesions on\\nthe buccal mucosa became ulcerated and painful; the other lesions were occasion-\\nally painful and pruritic. The lesions lasted 4 days to 2 weeks. Similar lesions re-\\ncurred intermittently thereafter, at intervals of approximately 3 to 4 months,\\nwithout seasonal variation or precipitant trauma.\\nAt age 6.9 years, she saw her pediatrician because of recurrent blisters on her\\nfeet, left knee, and both hands. A swab from a lesion on the toe was sent for cul-\\nture, and antibiotics were prescribed; the culture was sterile. During the following\\nweek, a pink rash developed under the arms and on the inner thighs. The patient\\nsaw a dermatologist at another facility. On examination, there were white, slight-\\nly oval plaques on the buccal mucosa that were approximately 2 to 3 cm in diam-\\neter. Tense bullae, containing clear to slightly cloudy fluid and measuring 3 to 8\\nmm in diameter, were located on the dorsum of all toes, extending slightly onto\\nthe feet (Fig. 1A); on the plantar surfaces of the toes and feet; and on the fingers\\nand palms. Several lesions were confluent. There were resolving bullae with minimal\\noverlying erythema and a slight hemorrhagic crust on the toes, and there was a re-\\nsolving bulla approximately 1 cm in diameter on the left knee (Fig. 1B). There were\\nmultiple pink-to-tan hyperkeratotic papules, 2 to 3 mm in diameter, on the upper\\nthighs and arms (Fig. 1C). There were no nail changes or scarring of the skin. Nikol-\\nsky's sign (ready removal of the epidermis with slight tangential pressure) was nega-\\ntive. Skin care to decrease local trauma and biopsy of a skin lesion for pathological\\nexamination were recommended.\\nTwo months later, a punch biopsy of the skin of the left inner arm was performed.\\nPathological examination revealed a subepidermal microvesicle. The results of im-\\nFigure 1. Cutaneous Lesions.\\nTwo years before this evaluation, numerous bullae, ulcers, and crusted lesions are present on the dorsal surfaces of\\nthe toes of the left foot (Panel A). There is a resolving bulla approximately 1 cm in diameter on the left knee (Panel B).\\nThere are multiple pink-to-tan hyperkeratotic papules, 2 to 3 mm in diameter, on the inner upper arms and axillae\\n(Panel C). Ten days after the initial evaluation at this hospital, vesicular lesions developed on both feet (Panel D).\\n(Photographs courtesy of Melissa M. Burnett, M.D., Pediatric Dermatology, Massachusetts General Hospital.)\\nmunohistochemical staining were interpreted as\\nshowing a lack of laminin-5 at the basement-\\nmembrane zone, the roof, and the floor of the\\nmicrovesicle. The findings were thought to be\\nconsistent with junctional epidermolysis bullosa,\\npossibly the Herlitz type. Genetic studies were not\\nperformed. Two years later, at age 8.9 years, she\\nwas referred to an allergist at another health\\ncare facility because of chronic sneezing, for which\\nshe was taking loratadine. Additional question-\\ning revealed that an oral rash had occurred after\\nthe consumption of mangoes, but radioallergo-\\nsorbent testing for allergy to mangoes was nega-\\ntive. Other test results included a white-cell count\\nof 14,200 cells per cubic millimeter (61% poly-\\nmorphonuclear leukocytes and 29% lymphocytes,\\nand a total eosinophil count of 748 cells per cubic\\nmillimeter). Analysis of a nasal smear revealed\\n1+ eosinophils and 3+ neutrophils. Environmen-\\ntal measures to decrease dust-mite exposure and\\ncontinued use of loratadine were recommended.\\nTreatment with antibiotics was given on sev-\\neral occasions and with famciclovir on one occa-\\nsion for suspected bacterial or viral infections,\\nwithout improvement in the lesions. At age 10.8\\nyears, she presented to the pediatric dermatology\\nclinic of this hospital.\\nThe patient had been born at a gestational age\\nof 38 weeks by emergency cesarean section and\\nweighed 5 lb 12 oz (2.6 kg) at birth. The prenatal\\ncourse had been complicated by maternal hyper-\\ntension. Routine childhood immunizations had\\nbeen administered. The patient had a seizure of\\nunknown origin at age 3 years; phenytoin was\\nadministered and later discontinued because of\\na rash. She was allergic to cephalexin, dust, and\\npollen. Her only medication was ibuprofen, as\\nneeded for pain. Her ethnic and racial background\\nwas Asian and white. Several relatives had atopy,\\nhives, and eczema, and her siblings were healthy.\\nThere was no family history of autoimmune dis-\\nease or blistering disorders. She appeared well, and\\nthe physical examination was normal, with no\\nscarring or visible abnormality of the oropharynx,\\nskin, or nails.\\nTen days after the visit, vesicular lesions devel-\\noped on both feet after the patient wore new shoes\\n(Fig. 1D). She returned to the dermatologist. Punch\\nbiopsies of skin lesions on both feet were per-\\nformed. Pathological examination with the use of\\nhematoxylin and eosin staining was interpreted\\nas showing spongiotic dermatitis with intraepi-\\ndermal vesicle formation and dyskeratosis. Stains\\nfor fungi and immunofluorescence staining for\\nIgA, IgG, IgM, C3, albumin, and fibrinogen were\\nnegative. The findings were thought to be consis-\\ntent with an eczematous process or pompholyx.\\nElectron microscopical examination showed a nor-\\nmal dermoepidermal junction with no evidence of\\nclefting, no degeneration of basal-layer keratino-\\ncytes, and normal collagen type VII. There was\\nprominent spongiosis, with occasional mononu-\\nclear inflammatory cells and necrotic keratino-\\ncytes.\\nAdditional diagnostic testing was performed.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDr. James G.H. Dinulos: In the differential diagnosis\\nof this child with recurrent oral ulcers and cuta-\\nneous bullae, one must ask two basic questions.\\nDoes this child have a primary cutaneous disor-\\nder in which the underlying mechanism of disease\\nis directed toward the skin? Or, does this child\\nhave cutaneous manifestations of a systemic dis-\\norder? Table 1 lists the disorders in each category\\nthat need to be considered in this case.\\nIn the evaluation of this child with oral ulcer-\\nations and cutaneous bullae, several key features\\nare important to consider. These include age at\\nonset, precipitating factors, general health of the\\nchild, family history of blisters, distribution of the\\nlesions, and the nature of the blisters (e.g., an es-\\ntimation of their depth [a negative or positive\\nNikolski's sign] and a determination of whether\\nthey are recurrent or constant).\\nIn the present case, four key points should be\\nconsidered when sorting through the many con-\\nditions on the differential-diagnosis list. First, the\\nchild was healthy for the first 2 years of life, and\\nshe appeared healthy, aside from her skin lesions,\\nwhen she presented to this hospital. Second, the\\ndisease process is chronic and intermittent, and\\nacute flares last less than 2 weeks. Third, the con-\\ndition leaves no residual cutaneous effects, such as\\nscarring; and fourth, the mouth and the hands\\nand feet (acral sites) are predominantly affected.\\nThese facts narrow our list of primary cutaneous\\nconditions to epidermolysis bullosa, contact der-\\nmatitis, and pompholyx. The systemic diseases\\npresenting in the skin that should be considered\\nin this child include recurrent erythema multi-\\nforme due to herpes simplex virus, Behçet's syn-\\ndrome, and gastrointestinal disorders such as\\nCrohn's disease and conditions producing malab-\\nsorption (e.g., cystic fibrosis and acrodermatitis\\nenteropathica).\\nEPIDERMOLYSIS BULLOSA\\nEpidermolysis bullosa, a group of inherited skin\\ndisorders characterized by skin fragility,¹ in which\\nbullae occur as a result of alterations in proteins\\nthat are critical for maintaining skin integrity, is\\nan important consideration in this case. Severe\\nforms of epidermolysis bullosa such as junctional\\nepidermolysis bullosa, which typically present at\\nbirth or in the newborn period, are unlikely, since\\nthis patient did not have blisters until the age of\\n2 years. A milder form, such as epidermolysis\\nbullosa simplex (the Weber-Cockayne variant),\\nwhich can present later in childhood and adoles-\\ncence with recurrent blisters on the legs, should\\nbe considered. Nonetheless, a biopsy specimen of\\na subepidermal blister was reported to show com-\\nplete absence of laminin-5, suggesting a severe\\nform of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, the Her-\\nlitz variant. Although there is great clinical and\\ngenetic heterogeneity in junctional epidermolysis\\nbullosa, severely affected patients die in infancy\\nbecause of widespread blistering; although mildly\\naffected patients survive, they have lifelong and\\npersistent blistering.2,3 In view of this patient's\\nclinical course, this diagnosis is unlikely, and the\\ncomplete absence of laminin-5 is probably a false\\npositive test result.\\nCONTACT DERMATITIS\\nContact allergens do not frequently cause oral ul-\\ncerations, such as those seen in this patient, al-\\nthough cinnamon mints, potassium dicyanoaurate,\\nnickel sulfate, and gold sodium may do so.4,5 A sys-\\ntemic reaction to oleoresin can produce a peri-\\noral and intertriginous rash. After this patient\\nate mangoes, a rash developed around her mouth,\\nsuggesting an allergy to oleoresin, but contact\\ndermatitis does not explain the associated inter-\\nmittent acral bullae. Contact dermatitis that leads\\nto the production of oral ulcerations that are fol-\\nlowed by intermittent acral bullae has not, to my\\nknowledge, been described. Although contact al-\\nlergy is an important consideration in this pa-\\ntient, it is not the likely diagnosis.\\nPOMPHOLYX\\nThe findings on the skin biopsy in this case were\\ninterpreted as consistent with pompholyx. This is\\na recurring condition characterized by discrete,\\nwell-defined vesicles, occurring principally on the\\nsides of the fingers and toes, which may resem-\\nble tapioca. The underlying cause is not known,\\nand although this condition is also referred to as\\ndyshidrotic eczema, there is no abnormality of\\nsweat glands. However, pompholyx does not in-\\nvolve the oral mucosa and is rare in preschool-\\nage children. Thus, this patient is not likely to have\\npompholyx.\\nRECURRENT ERYTHEMA MULTIFORME\\nThis patient's intermittent course, lesion duration\\nof about 2 weeks, oral ulcerations, and acral blis-\\nters, as well as the necrotic keratinocytes seen on\\nskin biopsy, would all be consistent with recurrent\\nerythema multiforme. Erythema multiforme is a\\nself-limited condition characterized by symmet-\\nrically distributed “target” or edematous papules,\\nvesicles, and bullae that tend to be distributed on\\nacral sites, remain for at least 7 days, and gener-\\nally heal without scarring. Many children present\\nwith oral lesions, as seen in this patient. 8,9 How-\\never, when erythema multiforme is recurrent, as\\nthe lesions are in this case, 10 it is most common-\\nly in a setting of recurrent infection with herpes\\nsimplex virus. This patient does not have a his-\\ntory of herpes simplex virus, and despite multiple\\nepisodes and physical examinations with several\\nphysicians, no classic target lesions were described.\\nFurther diagnostic testing could include testing of\\na skin lesion for herpes simplex virus nucleic acid\\nby polymerase chain reaction.11,12\\nBEHÇET'S DISEASE\\nBehçet's disease is a chronic vasculitis of unknown\\ncause that affects multiple organ systems; its ma-\\nTable 1.

Other clinical features that are considered\\nminor criteria include eye lesions (anterior or pos-\\nterior uveitis, cells in the vitreous, or retinal vascu-\\nlitis) and skin lesions (erythema nodosum, pseud-\\nofolliculitis, papulopustular lesions, or acneiform\\nlesions). Oral and genital ulcerations are seen in\\nvirtually all children with Behçet's disease.13 Our\\npatient has both oral and cutaneous lesions, but she\\nis not reported to have genital ulcerations; how-\\never, we were not told whether anyone actually per-\\nformed a complete examination of the genitalia.\\nAlthough the absence of genital ulcers argues\\nagainst a diagnosis of Behçet's disease in this case,\\na slit-lamp examination could be performed to as-\\nsist in evaluating for this diagnosis.\\nGASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS\\nGastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory\\nbowel disease are important diagnostic consider-\\nations in our patient, since gastrointestinal signs\\ncan be subtle and skin findings can precede gas-\\ntrointestinal findings. In children with asymptom-\\natic inflammatory bowel disease, extraintestinal\\nlesions are seen most commonly in the oral and\\nperianal regions and are more common in cases\\nof Crohn's disease than in cases of ulcerative coli-\\ntis.14 Oral lesions include lip swelling, gingival\\nedema, oral erosions and ulcerations, and angular\\ncheilitis. Perianal lesions include skin tags, pus-\\ntules, fissures, and abscesses. Because of the oral\\nlesions, occult Crohn's disease is an important con-\\nsideration in this patient.\\nFinally, disorders resulting in malabsorption\\nmay produce oral and acral rashes due to vitamin\\nand mineral deficiencies. Although this may oc-\\ncur in children with inflammatory bowel disease,\\nceliac disease, and cystic fibrosis, the classic ex-\\nample is acrodermatitis enteropathica due to zinc\\ndeficiency.15,16\\nACRODERMATITIS ENTEROPATHICA\\nZinc deficiency may occur as an autosomal reces-\\nsive inherited disorder due to mutations in the\\nSLC39A4 gene that encodes the zinc transporter\\nprotein ZIP4, a condition known as acrodermati-\\ntis enteropathica. Alternatively, it may occur as a\\nresult of an acquired condition that involves the\\ndefective absorption of zinc, producing an acro-\\ndermatitis enteropathica-like syndrome. Either\\nform may result in skin lesions similar to those\\nseen in this patient. The lesions in acrodermatitis\\nenteropathica are variable in appearance and in-\\nclude eczematous or psoriasiform plaques, angu-\\nlar cheilitis (i.e., perleche), and paronychia, or less\\ncommonly, vesicles and bullae; they occur on the\\narms and legs and the perigenital and perioral re-\\ngions. Without treatment, alopecia and diarrhea\\ncan develop.17 The vast majority of patients with\\ninherited zinc deficiency present during infancy:\\nsigns and symptoms of acrodermatitis develop in\\nbottle-fed infants shortly after birth, whereas in\\nbreast-fed infants the signs occur days to weeks\\nafter weaning.18 Symptoms did not develop in our\\npatient until 2 years of age, making the inherited\\nform unlikely. Acquired acrodermatitis can occur\\nin association with malabsorption syndromes,\\nextensive burns, Crohn's disease, sickle cell ane-\\nmia, celiac disease, systemic cancers, pancreatic\\ninsufficiency, renal tubular dysfunction, a defect\\nof mammary zinc secretion, short-bowel syndrome,\\ndiets high in phytates, total parenteral nutrition,\\nand prematurity. In this child, occult celiac dis-\\nease, Crohn's disease, and cystic fibrosis should\\nbe considered.\\nMy diagnosis is zinc deficiency - either acro-\\ndermatitis enteropathica or acrodermatitis entero-\\npathica-like syndrome. The diagnostic test should\\nbe a skin biopsy followed by determination of a\\nserum or plasma zinc level.\\nDr. Nancy Lee Harris (Pathology): Dr. Burnett, can\\nyou tell us your thinking at the time of the diag-\\nnostic procedures?\\nDr. Burnett: The patient carried a diagnosis of\\nepidermolysis bullosa with laminin-5 deficiency.\\nDr. Dinulos and I considered that diagnosis to be\\nunlikely, since the patient appeared well and had\\nno scarring. I considered a milder form of epider-\\nmolysis bullosa or an autoimmune bullous disor-\\nder such as bullous pemphigoid. I performed two\\npunch biopsies of affected skin, one of which was\\nprocessed for light microscopy and the other for\\nelectron microscopy.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nEpidermolysis bullosa.\\nDR. JAMES G.H. DINULOS'S\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nAcrodermatitis enteropathica or acrodermatitis en-\\nteropathica-like syndrome.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDr. Artur Zembowicz: The sections processed for rou-\\ntine histologic examination showed confluent in-\\ntraepidermal vesicles with a dense inflammatory\\ninfiltrate within intraepidermal spaces, at the der-\\nmoepidermal junction, and in the superficial retic-\\nular dermis (Fig. 2A). This process was initially\\ninterpreted as spongiotic dermatitis with dyskera-\\ntosis, a rather nonspecific pattern that can be seen\\nin cases of eczema, contact and systemic allergic\\nreactions, and a variety of other conditions. How-\\never, careful evaluation revealed that the mech-\\nanism of vesicle formation did not involve the\\naccumulation of intraepidermal fluid due to in-\\nflammation (spongiosis) but instead involved the\\ndegeneration of individual keratinocytes, with bal-\\nlooning degeneration, dyskeratosis, loss of inter-\\ncellular connections, cell necrosis, and a secondary\\ninflammatory response (Fig. 2B). Loss of kerati-\\nnocytes leads to pallor of the superficial layer of\\nthe epidermis that forms the roof of the vesicles\\n(Fig. 2A). These histologic features are consistent\\nwith epidermal changes due to a nutritional defi-\\nciency and have been described in cases of zinc\\ndeficiency associated with acrodermatitis entero-\\npathica, necrolytic migratory erythema associat-\\ned with the glucagonoma syndrome, free fatty\\nacid deficiency, and pellagra. The typical histo-\\nlogic changes present in the more common ery-\\nthematous lesions of acrodermatitis enteropathi-\\nca consist of degeneration of the surface epidermis\\nassociated with pallor on routine staining, para-\\nkeratosis, and a mild inflammatory infiltrate; the\\npseudospongiotic changes seen in this case are less\\ncommon but are characteristic of the bullous vari-\\nant acrodermatitis enteropathica.19,20 In view of\\nthe clinical picture, a bullous variant of acroder-\\nmatitis enteropathica or an acrodermatitis-like\\nsyndrome was thought to be the most likely diag-\\nnosis.\\nElectron microscopy was also performed, be-\\ncause it is useful in the evaluation of blistering\\ndisorders, especially epidermolysis bullosa and ac-\\nquired immunobullous disorders, since it allows\\nprecise determination of the level of split at the\\ndermoepidermal junction. In this case, the der-\\nmoepidermal junction had normal ultrastructure,\\nwithout evidence of bulla formation, findings that\\ndo not support the presence of either epidermoly-\\nsis bullosa or an immunobullous disease affect-\\ning the dermoepidermal junction. Subsequent test-\\ning disclosed that the serum level of zinc was\\n311 µg per liter (5 µmol per liter) (reference range,\\n670 to 1240 µg per liter [10 to 19 μmol per liter]),\\nconfirming the diagnosis of zinc deficiency.\\nThis case illustrates the diagnostic challenges\\nin recognizing zinc deficiency in children and the\\nneed for increased awareness of this readily treat-\\nable condition among pediatricians and patholo-\\ngists. The diagnosis of acrodermatitis enteropath-\\nica is often delayed for months or years, as it was\\nin this case, even when skin biopsies are per-\\nformed. The bullous variant of the disease, which\\nthis patient has, is particularly challenging, be-\\ncause it is not usually considered in the clinical\\ndifferential diagnosis of bullous diseases of child-\\nhood, and the epidermal changes seen on exami-\\nnation of skin-biopsy specimens are often mis-\\ninterpreted as spongiotic dermatitis, as initially\\nhappened in this case.20\\nDr. Burnett: After the diagnosis was made, the\\npatient was referred to a gastroenterologist. Her\\ndiet was low in red meat, but she was not a pure\\nvegetarian. She did not take any dietary supple-\\nments. She had a normal serum IgA level and did\\nnot have antibodies to gliadin or transglutami-\\nnase, which made celiac disease unlikely.

During periods\\nof stress, such as growth, increased zinc require-\\nments may overcome the patient's ability for zinc\\nabsorption and produce cutaneous findings.\", 'images_used': [], 'answer': \"WORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Acrodermatitis enteropathica\\nDISEASE_NAME: Acrodermatitis enteropathica\\n\\nReasoning:\\n\\n1.  **Information Gathering:** The patient is a 10-year-old girl with recurrent oral ulcers and cutaneous bullae. The lesions are intermittent, lasting 4 days to 2 weeks, and occur at intervals of 3-4 months. She has a history of oral rash after mango consumption (negative allergy test), and the skin biopsy shows spongiotic dermatitis with intraepidermal vesicle formation and dyskeratosis. The patient is well-nourished, and there is no family history of blistering disorders. The zinc level is low (311 µg/L).\\n\\n2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\\n\\n    *   **System 1 (Intuitive):** The intermittent nature of the lesions, the presence of oral ulcers, and the skin biopsy findings (spongiotic dermatitis with dyskeratosis) strongly suggest a nutritional deficiency. The recurrent nature points towards a chronic condition.\\n    *   **System 2 (Analytic):** The differential diagnosis includes epidermolysis bullosa, contact dermatitis, pompholyx, recurrent erythema multiforme, Behçet's syndrome, and gastrointestinal disorders. However, the lack of scarring, the negative Nikolsky's sign, and the specific biopsy findings make these diagnoses less likely.\\n\\n3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\\n\\n    *   **Defining Features:** The key features are the recurrent oral ulcers, the cutaneous bullae, the spongiotic dermatitis with dyskeratosis on biopsy, and the low zinc level.\\n    *   **Discriminatory Features:** The intermittent nature of the lesions, the lack of scarring, and the negative Nikolsky's sign help to differentiate this condition from other blistering disorders.\\n    *   **Point-of-Care Tests/Labs:** A serum zinc level is the most important test to confirm the diagnosis.\\n    *   **Potential Diagnostic Biases:** Anchoring to the initial biopsy interpretation (spongiotic dermatitis) could lead to overlooking the specific features of acrodermatitis enteropathica.\\n\\n4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:** The combination of clinical findings (recurrent oral ulcers, cutaneous bullae, intermittent nature of lesions) and the low zinc level strongly supports the diagnosis of acrodermatitis enteropathica. The patient's age and the lack of severe blistering make the hereditary form less likely. The intermittent nature of the lesions is consistent with the acquired form.\\n\\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\\\boxed{WORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Acrodermatitis enteropathica, DISEASE_NAME: Acrodermatitis enteropathica}$\\n\", 'original_file': 'NEJMcpc0805312.json'}\n",

The pain increased in severity over a period of\\nseveral days and began to radiate intermittently to the right shoulder. She under-\\nwent an acupressure massage, without relief, and the next day tingling developed\\nin all fingers but was most severe in the first three fingers of the right hand. She\\ntook nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, without improvement.\\nTwelve days before admission, the patient went to the urgent care clinic at an-\\nother hospital. She reported that intermittent right-sided neck pain and mild\\nheadaches had occurred for the past 3 months, which she had attributed to muscle\\nstrain from work-related activity. On examination, she appeared uncomfortable.\\nThe range of motion of the neck was decreased in all directions, and the muscles\\nof the right lateral neck were tender and taut. Strength and sensation were intact\\nin the arms. There was no evidence of radiculopathy. Cyclobenzaprine, ibuprofen,\\nand oxycodone-acetaminophen were administered.\\nFive days before admission, the patient returned to the urgent care clinic because\\nof increasing pain that was not responsive to heat, as well as intermittent numbness\\nin the left hand with a sensation of increased warmth. On examination, she ap-\\npeared uncomfortable and held her head stiffly. The temperature was 38.2°C, the\\nblood pressure 138/70 mm Hg, and the pulse 92 beats per minute. She was unable\\nto raise her arms above her head, and the range of motion of the neck was esti-\\nmated to be 25% of the normal range of motion. The suboccipital and trapezius\\nmuscles were tense, without point tenderness. Hand grasp, sensation in the arms,\\nand deep-tendon reflexes were normal. A radiograph of the neck was normal.\\nAnalysis of the urine revealed values of 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter) for\\nglucose and 15 mg per deciliter for ketones. The serum glucose level was 156 mg\\nper deciliter (8.7 mmol per liter), and the sodium level was 132 mmol per liter;\\nmeasurements of other electrolyte levels and renal function were normal. Other\\nlaboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Ke-\\ntorolac tromethamine (60 mg) was administered,\\nwith relief of the pain within 30 minutes. Ketoro-\\nlac (10 mg up to every 4 to 6 hours as needed for\\npain) was prescribed, and a soft cervical neck col-\\nlar was provided. She was advised to return if her\\ncondition did not improve; an appointment with\\nan orthopedist was scheduled for 3 days later.\\nTwo days later, 3 days before admission, the\\ntemperature rose to 40.0°C, with chills, cough,\\nand pain on swallowing and neck movement.\\nThe patient returned to the urgent care clinic.\\nShe did not have headache, visual changes,\\nweakness, bowel or bladder dysfunction, dysu-\\nria, or dyspnea. On examination, the tempera-\\nture was 38.1°C, the pulse 80 beats per minute,\\nthe respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and\\nthe blood pressure 130/60 mm Hg. The range\\nof motion of the neck was limited because of\\npain; the remainder of the examination was\\nnormal. A 5-day course of azithromycin was pre-\\nscribed.\\nThe next day, the temperature rose to 39.4°C;\\nthe patient saw her primary care physician and\\nan orthopedist. She reported decreased neck\\npain. The temperature was 37.2°C; the face ap-\\npeared flushed and slightly swollen. The neck\\nwas tender without masses; the pain was in-\\ncreased with both extension and flexion of the\\nneck. Deep-tendon reflexes of the biceps and the\\nbrachialis muscles on the right were slightly di-\\nminished as compared with those on the left.\\nSpecimens of blood were sent for cultures. Mea-\\nsurements of creatine kinase and aldolase levels\\nwere normal; other laboratory-test results are\\nshown in Table 1, and additional test results\\nwere pending. MRI of the cervical spine, per-\\nformed without the administration of contrast\\nmaterial, revealed a large epidural fluid collec-\\ntion in the disk space extending from the level\\nof the fourth to seventh cervical vertebrae, with\\nmaximum thickness at the level of the fifth to\\nsixth vertebrae. There was evidence of mild cord\\ncompression. The next day, she saw an infec-\\ntious-disease specialist.\\nThe patient was a technologist in a microbiol-\\nogy laboratory. Seven months earlier, she had\\nbeen exposed to a specimen obtained by fine-\\nneedle aspiration from which Brucella melitensis\\nwas subsequently cultured. Two weeks after the\\nexposure, when the organism was identified,\\nshe was seen in the occupational health clinic of\\nthis hospital. A specimen of blood was drawn\\nand stored for serologic testing for brucella. She\\nwas advised to take prophylactic antibiotics, but\\nshe declined therapy. Follow-up by telephone oc-\\ncurred weekly for the next 3 1/2 months, during\\nwhich she felt well. Three months before admis-\\nsion, the patient noted discomfort in the right\\nupper back and right side of the neck, swelling\\nin the right side of the neck that she believed\\nwas an enlarged lymph node, and pain on swal-\\nlowing; she returned to the occupational health\\nclinic. She did not have fever, chills, night\\nsweats, malaise, weakness, or arthralgias. The\\ntemperature was 37.1°C. Slightly enlarged, soft\\nposterior cervical lymph nodes were palpated;\\nthe remainder of the examination was normal.\\nAt this time, testing for antibodies to brucella\\non a specimen of blood obtained 4 months ear-\\nlier and a current specimen were performed\\n(Table 1).\\nThe patient had received bacille Calmette-\\nGuérin vaccine in childhood, and a tuberculin\\nskin test had been positive years earlier. She\\nhad never taken antituberculosis medications.\\nShe had scoliosis of the thoracic spine, osteo-\\nporosis, and occasional hip pain; a bone scan\\nobtained 17 days earlier revealed minimal de-\\ngenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine,\\nwith no evidence of stress fractures. The pa-\\ntient had been born in Taiwan, immigrated to\\nthe United States 30 years earlier, and lived in\\nNew England. She was married and had two\\nhealthy adult children. She gardened frequently\\nand drank alcohol occasionally; she had no his-\\ntory of tobacco or illicit drug use, recent travel,\\nor exposure to sick persons. Medications in-\\ncluded ketorolac, ibuprofen, aspirin, azithromy-\\ncin, alendronate, and conjugated estrogens and\\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate. There were no\\nallergies.\\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8°C.\\nThere was severe pain on palpation of the right\\nlateral neck; there were no palpable masses or\\nlymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the ex-\\namination was normal. The next day, an MRI\\nscan obtained after the administration of gado-\\nlinium revealed a peripherally enhancing extra-\\ndural fluid collection along the posterior aspect\\nof the C5 and C6 vertebral bodies, a finding that\\nwas consistent with an epidural abscess. This\\nlesion resulted in mass effect over the ventral\\naspect of the spinal cord. The patient was admit-\\nted to the other hospital. The vital signs were\\nnormal, and the findings on physical examina-\\ntion were unchanged. Vancomycin and narcotic\\nanalgesia were administered intravenously. Mea-\\nsurements of serum electrolyte levels and renal\\nfunction were normal; results of other labora-\\ntory tests are shown in Table 1.\\nOn the fifth hospital day a diagnostic-test\\nresult was received. The patient was transferred\\nto this hospital for further care.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDr. Javier M. Romero: An MRI scan of the cervical\\nspine, obtained on the day of admission to the\\nother hospital, shows high signal intensity with-\\nin the C5 and C6 vertebral bodies, most likely\\nrepresenting edema (Fig. 1A). T₂-weighted im-\\nages show a hyperintense epidural lesion at this\\nlevel, probably representing an epidural fluid col-\\nlection (Fig. 1B). T₁-weighted images obtained\\nafter the administration of gadolinium show lin-\\near enhancement at the margin of the epidural\\nlesion and enhancement of the overlying dura,\\nresulting in mild cord compression (Fig. 1C).\\nThe differential diagnosis for a progressive,\\nenhancing lesion involving two adjacent verte-\\nbral bodies, prevertebral soft tissues, and an\\nepidural fluid collection that does not compro-\\nmise the intervertebral disk or vertebral end\\nplates includes granulomatous osteomyelitis\\nand, less likely, an atypical presentation of a\\npyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis, a metastasis,\\nand lymphoma.1,2\\nDr. Julie L. Gerberding: This microbiologist was\\nadmitted with acute symptoms and signs sug-\\ngestive of a cervical epidural abscess, which fol-\\nlowed a history of neck pain and headaches for\\nweeks to months. Fever did not occur until 5 days\\nbefore admission, when the severity of her symp-\\ntoms escalated. She did not have the classic triad\\nof signs and symptoms of cervical epidural ab-\\nscess — fever, pain in the neck, and radiculopa-\\nthy — until the day before admission to the\\nhospital. However, most patients with epidural\\nabscesses do not initially present with this triad,\\nand the diagnosis should be suspected whenever\\nany combination of these findings occurs. Impor-\\ntant laboratory findings include the gradual de-\\nvelopment of anemia over a period of 3 months,\\na moderately elevated sedimentation rate, elevat-\\ned aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase\\nlevels at the time of admission, and negative\\nserologic tests for brucella.\\nSPINAL EPIDURAL ABSCESS\\nThere are many causes of spinal epidural ab-\\nscess. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common\\ncause in the United States, and the patient\\'s\\nacute illness was entirely consistent with that\\ndiagnosis.3 Hematogenous dissemination from\\na primary source in a patient who is at increased\\nrisk for invasive staphylococcal disease is the\\nmost common mechanism for the development\\nof an epidural abscess, but this patient had no\\nhistory suggestive of this. Since the emergence of\\ncommunity-acquired, methicillin-resistant staphy-\\nlococcal infections has increased the likelihood\\nthat a health care worker could be colonized with\\nstaphylococci, empirical treatment with vanco-\\nmycin was appropriate.\\nTUBERCULOSIS\\nThe patient\\'s history suggests a risk of exposure\\nto two pathogens that could account for her\\nclinical illness. She was born in a part of the\\nworld where tuberculosis is endemic. Despite\\nreceipt of bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine, she\\nmay have been infected with Mycobacterium tuber-\\nculosis before she moved to the United States.\\nThe most common manifestation of a tubercular\\nspinal infection is vertebral-body infection with\\nanterior collapse (Pott\\'s disease). The thoracic\\nand lumbar spines are much more likely to be\\naffected than is the cervical spine. Preservation\\nof the disk spaces, as seen in this case, is one of\\nthe hallmarks of spinal tuberculosis. Although\\nparavertebral abscesses are a more likely soft-\\ntissue complication, epidural abscesses also oc-\\ncur. The MRI findings of vertebral-body involve-\\nment, sparing of the disk space, and anterior\\nedema, as well as the posterior epidural abscess,\\nare consistent with M. tuberculosis infection.\\nBRUCELLOSIS\\nThe patient also reported occupational exposure\\nto a clinical specimen of B. melitensis 7 months\\nbefore admission, and she had been monitored\\nin the occupational health clinic for 4 months\\nafter the exposure. Patients with brucellosis may\\npresent with focal findings, but the disease is\\nalways systemic. It is one of the most common\\nzoonotic diseases in the world and remains a se-\\nrious threat to animals and humans in countries\\nsurrounding the Mediterranean Sea, on the Ara-\\nbian Peninsula, and in Central and South Ameri-\\nca. Humans acquire infection by ingestion of\\nunpasteurized milk products or, less commonly,\\ningestion of poorly cooked meat from infected\\nanimals, by direct or indirect exposure to the or-\\nganism through mucous membranes or broken\\nskin, or by inhalation of infectious material. In\\nlaboratories, inhalation of aerosols is an ex-\\ntremely important mode of transmission, be-\\ncause the inoculum necessary to cause disease is\\nvery low. In countries where the disease is endem-\\nic, it is the most common laboratory-acquired\\ninfection, occurring in 12% of laboratory work-\\ners in Spain, according to one study. In the United\\nStates, infection with brucella species is one of\\nthe most common laboratory-acquired infections,\\naccounting for 10% of all laboratory-acquired in-\\nfections, 24% of laboratory-acquired bacterial\\ninfections, and 11% of deaths attributable to oc-\\ncupational exposure.5 Thus, the risk that this pa-\\ntient acquired brucellosis from her exposure in\\nthe laboratory is high.\\nBrucellosis can involve any tissue, including\\nthe spine, although the frequency of vertebral\\ninvolvement is difficult to ascertain from pub-\\nlished case series. 6,7 Spinal involvement can be\\nfocal, as in this case, or it can involve multiple\\nvertebrae. The typical spinal involvement is a\\ndiskitis or spondylitis, but osteomyelitis and\\nabscesses are not rare, and soft-tissue masses,\\nincluding epidural abscesses and prevertebral\\nedema, occur in more than half the cases.6\\nThe patient\\'s occupational exposure occurred\\n7 months before she was admitted to the hospi-\\ntal and about 4 months before neck symptoms\\ndeveloped, which in retrospect may have been\\nthe first clinical evidence of infection. The incu-\\nbation period for brucella infection is highly vari-\\nable, ranging from a few days to many months.\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n(CDC) recommends that laboratory workers ex-\\nposed to brucella undergo active surveillance for\\nfever for 6 months after the last exposure, as\\nwell as testing for seroconversion with the use\\nof a microagglutination assay at the CDC or the\\nstate public health laboratory. In this case,\\nserum samples obtained both 2 weeks and\\n4 months after exposure were tested for bru-\\ncella antibodies, but the results were normal.\\nAntibody tests are usually positive by the time\\nthe patient has clinical evidence of brucellosis,\\nbut serial quantitative serologic assays are re-\\nquired for the monitoring of exposed laboratory\\nworkers. A prozone phenomenon, in which very\\nhigh titers of antibody interfere with agglutina-\\ntion, may cause a false negative test result. Al-\\nternatively, this patient may have had a second\\nunsuspected or unreported exposure to brucella\\nor sequestration of the organism within the\\nabscess.\\nIn patients with acute spinal infection, blood\\ncultures usually reveal the organism. This patient\\nbegan treatment with azithromycin 24 hours\\nbefore the blood cultures were drawn. Azithro-\\nmycin has some in vitro activity against brucella\\nspecies but does not have high activity in intrac-\\nellular phagolysosomes where the organism is\\nlocated. A negative blood culture in the presence\\nof antimicrobial therapy with azithromycin may\\ntherefore be a false negative result.\\nClinicians and laboratory staff involved in the\\ndiagnosis of brucellosis should also be cognizant\\nof federal regulations associated with this dis-\\nease. The possession, use, and transfer of B. abor-\\ntus, B. suis, and B. melitensis in the United States\\nare regulated under the \"select agent\" rules of\\nthe Department of Health and Human Services\\nand the Department of Agriculture (USDA) (see\\nwww.selectagents.gov) in accordance with the\\nCode of Federal Regulations (42 CFR 73, 7 CFR\\n331, and 9 CFR 121). The isolation of these spe-\\ncies, as well as associated laboratory exposures,\\nmust be reported to either the CDC or the USDA\\nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\\nSUMMARY\\nBrucella-associated vertebral osteomyelitis com-\\nplicated by an epidural abscess would account for\\nthis patient\\'s symptoms and signs. Although dis-\\ntinguishing spinal infection due to tuberculosis\\nfrom that due to brucellosis is difficult on purely\\nclinical grounds, the pretest probability of bru-\\ncellosis is high in view of the patient\\'s laboratory\\nexposure, her decision not to have prophylactic\\nantimicrobial treatment, and the absence of con-\\nditions that would cause reactivation of latent\\ntuberculosis. I suspect that the diagnostic-test\\nresult was a blood culture that showed B. meliten-\\nsis, a slow-growing organism that might take\\neven longer to be detected in the blood because\\nof the azithromycin treatment she had received.\\nDr. Eric S. Rosenberg (Pathology): Dr. Heller,\\nwhat was your clinical impression after seeing\\nthis patient at the other hospital?\\nDr. Howard M. Heller (Infectious Disease): Al-\\nthough I was concerned about brucella, my\\nconcern was mitigated by the negative serologic\\ntests so many months after the exposure, so\\nstaphylococcal infection was higher on my list.\\nBoth the radiologist and the neurosurgeon\\nthought that the abscess was in an area that\\nwould be difficult to aspirate or drain. I chose to\\ntreat the patient with vancomycin alone while we\\nawaited the results of blood cultures and re-\\npeated brucella serologic tests, performed at a\\ndifferent laboratory.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nS. aureus osteomyelitis with epidural abscess.\\nDR. JULIE L. GERBERDING\\'S\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nB. melitensis vertebral osteomyelitis complicated\\nby an epidural abscess.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDr. Mary Jane Ferraro: The diagnostic result was\\nthat of a blood culture. After 6 days of incuba-\\ntion, blood that was cultured aerobically in one\\nof the blood-culture bottles grew small, gram-\\nnegative coccobacillary organisms, which were\\nconsistent with brucella species. The isolate was\\nreferred that day to the Massachusetts Depart-\\nment of Public Health State Laboratory Institute\\nfor further identification, according to the current\\nprotocol of the CDC Laboratory Response Network\\nfor Bioterrorism. The next day, a presumptive\\nidentification of brucella was reported by the\\nstate laboratory. Rapid identification was achieved\\nwith the use of polymerase-chain-reaction nucle-\\nic acid amplification and genus-specific brucella\\nDNA probes. The organism was ultimately iden-\\ntified as B. melitensis biovar 3 at the CDC.\\nDETERMINING THE SOURCE OF THE INFECTION\\nOur first question was whether this infection had\\nresulted from the exposure 7 months earlier or\\nwhether there had been a second exposure. The\\norganism that the patient (the laboratory tech-\\nnologist) had been exposed to was from a spinal\\nepidural abscess in a 67-year-old woman and was\\nidentified as B. melitensis biovar 3. To definitively\\nlink our patient\\'s isolate to that specimen, Dr. Ba-\\nrun Kumar De at the CDC performed genetic pro-\\nfiling based on the variable number of tandem\\nrepeats at 15 different genetic loci (multilocus vari-\\nable-number tandem repeats assay) to determine\\nthe relatedness of the two isolates. B. melitensis\\nisolates from the original patient, her husband\\n(also infected with B. melitensis), and the laboratory\\ntechnologist were compared. The technologist\\'s\\nisolate matched the original patient\\'s isolate in 14\\nof the 15 loci and matched the husband\\'s isolate\\nin 13 of the 15 loci. Dr. De concluded that the tech-\\nnologist had probably been infected while work-\\ning with the B. melitensis culture 7 months earlier.\\nWe then asked why the results of microag-\\nglutination testing for IgG and IgM antibodies\\nto B. melitensis remained negative 4 months after\\nexposure. A specimen of blood obtained on the\\npatient\\'s admission to the other hospital was\\ntested at another reference laboratory with the\\nuse of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\\n(ELISA).10 The test revealed IgM and IgG anti-\\nbodies to brucella. A sample obtained 4 months\\nafter exposure was then retested both at the\\nCDC reference laboratory and at the Massachu-\\nsetts Department of Public Health State Labora-\\ntory Institute. According to the ELISA method,\\nthis specimen was positive for IgM and negative\\nfor IgG antibodies. Repeated microagglutination\\ntesting of that specimen at the two laboratories\\ndetected total antibody titers of 1:40 and 1:80,\\nrespectively, either of which represented an in-\\ncrease by a factor of three over the initial nega-\\ntive test. Tests for IgG antibody were negative at\\nboth laboratories. Had IgM antibodies been re-\\nported in the sample at the time, even at these\\nvery low levels, the hospital\\'s Occupational\\nHealth Service would have continued to monitor\\nthis patient\\'s symptoms.\\nLESSONS LEARNED BY THE LABORATORY\\nAn adverse event such as this is an opportunity to\\nlearn about problems in our practice and to cor-\\nrect them. We asked several questions.\\nShould the microbiology laboratory change\\nthe biosafety-level practices for tissue specimens?\\nOur procedures specified that the initial workup\\nof all positive blood cultures and of any slowly\\ngrowing organism resembling brucella from\\nanother specimen type should be performed in a\\nbiosafety cabinet with the use of biosafety level\\n3 (BSL3) practices (gown, gloves, and avoidance\\nof aerosols by using a biosafety cabinet). This\\ntechnologist reported that she initially suspected\\nhaemophilus species in the culture and per-\\nformed the initial tests on the open bench with\\nonly biosafety level 2 practices. We therefore\\nundertook complete retraining of the entire lab-\\noratory staff on the protocol for testing slowly\\ngrowing bacterial pathogens from tissues and\\nfluids. We also discussed whether it would be\\nfeasible to convert part of our laboratory to a\\nBSL3 facility but determined that it would be\\nneither feasible nor necessary in view of the low\\nincidence of brucella in our community.\\nAre our serologic testing methods adequate?\\nThe discrepant results of serologic testing ob-\\ntained in this case underscore the fact that sero-\\nlogic testing for brucella is not perfect, and both\\nthe sensitivity and specificity of the tests may\\nvary. The microagglutination test is considered\\nthe standard, 11 although there have been some\\nreports of lower sensitivity with this test than\\nwith some of the newer ELISA tests. However,\\nfalse positive IgM results have been reported\\nwith ELISA tests.11 In the future, we will request\\ntesting by both methods.\\nCan clinicians help? In order to minimize the\\nrisk of exposure of laboratory staff, any suspi-\\ncion of brucellosis, based on epidemiologic or\\nclinical information, should be communicated\\nto the laboratory on the requisition. This prac-\\ntice not only protects the staff but also benefits\\nthe patient, because if the laboratory knows\\nwhat organisms are suspected, a faster and more\\ndirected workup can be initiated. By presenting\\nthis case at a Clinicopathological Conference, we\\nhope to increase awareness of this problem\\namong clinicians.\\nDr. Rosenberg: Dr. Atkins, what would the Oс-\\ncupational Health Service do differently if an-\\nother occupational exposure to brucella occurs?\\nDr. Elisha H. Atkins (Occupational Health Ser-\\nvice): Although evidence supporting the use of\\npostexposure prophylaxis is limited, we would\\nmore strongly encourage it, particularly for\\nthose at highest risk from handling the speci-\\nmen. Second, we would follow exposed employ-\\nees for 6 months. In this case, we consulted the\\nDepartment of Public Health, and the incubation\\nperiod for brucella was thought to be up to 60\\ndays, so we followed exposed workers for twice\\nthat time, for 120 days. We would also change\\nour clinical evaluation of employees with symp-\\ntoms. I saw this employee when symptoms de-\\nveloped, 4 months after exposure, and thought\\nthe likelihood of brucellosis was low, because\\nsymptoms began after what we thought was the\\nmaximal incubation period and because she had\\nhad no fever and her serologic test for brucella\\nwas negative. In a similar situation, I would now\\ncheck a blood culture and, most important, en-\\nsure longer and closer follow up.\\nDr. Rosenberg: Dr. Heller, how did you manage\\nthis patient\\'s illness, and how is she now?\\nDr. Heller: Once the culture result indicated\\ninfection with brucella, we discontinued vanco-\\nmycin and began to administer doxycycline with\\ngentamicin. After her liver-function tests returned\\nto normal, we switched to a combination of doxy-\\ncycline and rifampin. The resolution of her symp-\\ntoms and the radiographic improvement were\\nslow, and we treated her for a total of 3 months.\\nEighteen months after treatment, she is well.\\nShe has some residual neck pain but has other-\\nwise had a complete recovery.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "Based on the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is **Brucella-associated vertebral osteomyelitis complicated by an epidural abscess.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Information Gathering:**\n",
      "    *   **Key Signs/Symptoms:** Neck pain, fever, swelling in the neck, tingling in the fingers, headache, neck stiffness, decreased range of motion, and a large epidural fluid collection on MRI.\n",
      "    *   **Duration:** Symptoms have been present for several weeks, with a recent worsening.\n",
      "    *   **Epidemiologic Context:** Occupational exposure to a specimen from a fine-needle aspiration (likely a bone biopsy or other tissue sample) from a patient with a known Brucella infection.\n",
      "    *   **Comorbidities/Medications:** No significant comorbidities or medications mentioned.\n",
      "    *   **Red-Flag Features:** Fever, neck stiffness, and neurological symptoms (tingling, decreased reflexes) are concerning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Hypothesis Generation:**\n",
      "    *   **Anatomical System:** Spinal cord compression due to the epidural abscess.\n",
      "    *   **Timing/Progression:** The symptoms developed gradually over weeks, with a recent acute worsening.\n",
      "    *   **Age/Risk Factors:** The patient's age (58 years old) is not a major risk factor for Brucella infection, but the occupational exposure is a significant risk factor.\n",
      "    *   **Differential Diagnosis:**\n",
      "        *   **Brucella Osteomyelitis:** This is the most likely diagnosis given the occupational exposure and the presence of an epidural abscess.\n",
      "        *   **Staphylococcus aureus Epidural Abscess:** This is a possibility, but the occupational history makes Brucella more likely.\n",
      "        *   **Tuberculosis (TB) Spinal Infection:** Less likely given the lack of classic TB symptoms (night sweats, weight loss) and the absence of a positive tuberculin skin test.\n",
      "        *   **Other Infections:** Less likely given the clinical picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
      "    *   **Defining Features:** The presence of an epidural abscess, the history of Brucella exposure, and the clinical symptoms are defining features.\n",
      "    *   **Discriminatory Features:** The occupational history is a key discriminator. The MRI findings (epidural fluid collection) are also highly suggestive.\n",
      "    *   **Point-of-Care Tests/Labs:**\n",
      "        *   Blood cultures to confirm the presence of Brucella.\n",
      "        *   Brucella serology (ELISA and/or microagglutination) to confirm the diagnosis.\n",
      "        *   MRI to assess the extent of the abscess and cord compression.\n",
      "    *   **Potential Diagnostic Biases:**\n",
      "        *   **Anchoring Bias:** The initial suspicion of a staphylococcal infection might have influenced the initial treatment.\n",
      "        *   **Availability Bias:** The availability of Brucella serology might have led to a more rapid diagnosis.\n",
      "        *   **Framing Bias:** The presentation of the case as a \"Brucella infection\" might have influenced the clinician's thinking.\n",
      "    *   **Early Empiric Considerations:** Given the high suspicion for Brucella, empiric antibiotic therapy with doxycycline and gentamicin should be initiated while awaiting culture results.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:**\n",
      "    *   The patient's history of Brucella exposure, combined with the clinical presentation and MRI findings, strongly suggests Brucella-associated vertebral osteomyelitis with an epidural abscess.\n",
      "    *   The patient's symptoms are consistent with spinal cord compression.\n",
      "    *   The initial treatment with vancomycin was appropriate, but the diagnosis of Brucella infection was eventually confirmed.\n",
      "    *   The patient is currently being treated with doxycycline and gentamicin.\n",
      "    *   **Warning Signs:** Worsening neurological symptoms (weakness, bowel/bladder dysfunction), sepsis, and failure to respond to antibiotics.\n",

The pain increased in severity over a period of\\nseveral days and began to radiate intermittently to the right shoulder. She under-\\nwent an acupressure massage, without relief, and the next day tingling developed\\nin all fingers but was most severe in the first three fingers of the right hand. She\\ntook nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, without improvement.\\nTwelve days before admission, the patient went to the urgent care clinic at an-\\nother hospital. She reported that intermittent right-sided neck pain and mild\\nheadaches had occurred for the past 3 months, which she had attributed to muscle\\nstrain from work-related activity. On examination, she appeared uncomfortable.\\nThe range of motion of the neck was decreased in all directions, and the muscles\\nof the right lateral neck were tender and taut. Strength and sensation were intact\\nin the arms. There was no evidence of radiculopathy. Cyclobenzaprine, ibuprofen,\\nand oxycodone-acetaminophen were administered.\\nFive days before admission, the patient returned to the urgent care clinic because\\nof increasing pain that was not responsive to heat, as well as intermittent numbness\\nin the left hand with a sensation of increased warmth. On examination, she ap-\\npeared uncomfortable and held her head stiffly. The temperature was 38.2°C, the\\nblood pressure 138/70 mm Hg, and the pulse 92 beats per minute. She was unable\\nto raise her arms above her head, and the range of motion of the neck was esti-\\nmated to be 25% of the normal range of motion. The suboccipital and trapezius\\nmuscles were tense, without point tenderness. Hand grasp, sensation in the arms,\\nand deep-tendon reflexes were normal. A radiograph of the neck was normal.\\nAnalysis of the urine revealed values of 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter) for\\nglucose and 15 mg per deciliter for ketones. The serum glucose level was 156 mg\\nper deciliter (8.7 mmol per liter), and the sodium level was 132 mmol per liter;\\nmeasurements of other electrolyte levels and renal function were normal. Other\\nlaboratory-test results are shown in Table 1. Ke-\\ntorolac tromethamine (60 mg) was administered,\\nwith relief of the pain within 30 minutes. Ketoro-\\nlac (10 mg up to every 4 to 6 hours as needed for\\npain) was prescribed, and a soft cervical neck col-\\nlar was provided. She was advised to return if her\\ncondition did not improve; an appointment with\\nan orthopedist was scheduled for 3 days later.\\nTwo days later, 3 days before admission, the\\ntemperature rose to 40.0°C, with chills, cough,\\nand pain on swallowing and neck movement.\\nThe patient returned to the urgent care clinic.\\nShe did not have headache, visual changes,\\nweakness, bowel or bladder dysfunction, dysu-\\nria, or dyspnea. On examination, the tempera-\\nture was 38.1°C, the pulse 80 beats per minute,\\nthe respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and\\nthe blood pressure 130/60 mm Hg. The range\\nof motion of the neck was limited because of\\npain; the remainder of the examination was\\nnormal. A 5-day course of azithromycin was pre-\\nscribed.\\nThe next day, the temperature rose to 39.4°C;\\nthe patient saw her primary care physician and\\nan orthopedist. She reported decreased neck\\npain. The temperature was 37.2°C; the face ap-\\npeared flushed and slightly swollen. The neck\\nwas tender without masses; the pain was in-\\ncreased with both extension and flexion of the\\nneck. Deep-tendon reflexes of the biceps and the\\nbrachialis muscles on the right were slightly di-\\nminished as compared with those on the left.\\nSpecimens of blood were sent for cultures. Mea-\\nsurements of creatine kinase and aldolase levels\\nwere normal; other laboratory-test results are\\nshown in Table 1, and additional test results\\nwere pending. MRI of the cervical spine, per-\\nformed without the administration of contrast\\nmaterial, revealed a large epidural fluid collec-\\ntion in the disk space extending from the level\\nof the fourth to seventh cervical vertebrae, with\\nmaximum thickness at the level of the fifth to\\nsixth vertebrae. There was evidence of mild cord\\ncompression. The next day, she saw an infec-\\ntious-disease specialist.\\nThe patient was a technologist in a microbiol-\\nogy laboratory. Seven months earlier, she had\\nbeen exposed to a specimen obtained by fine-\\nneedle aspiration from which Brucella melitensis\\nwas subsequently cultured. Two weeks after the\\nexposure, when the organism was identified,\\nshe was seen in the occupational health clinic of\\nthis hospital. A specimen of blood was drawn\\nand stored for serologic testing for brucella. She\\nwas advised to take prophylactic antibiotics, but\\nshe declined therapy. Follow-up by telephone oc-\\ncurred weekly for the next 3 1/2 months, during\\nwhich she felt well. Three months before admis-\\nsion, the patient noted discomfort in the right\\nupper back and right side of the neck, swelling\\nin the right side of the neck that she believed\\nwas an enlarged lymph node, and pain on swal-\\nlowing; she returned to the occupational health\\nclinic. She did not have fever, chills, night\\nsweats, malaise, weakness, or arthralgias. The\\ntemperature was 37.1°C. Slightly enlarged, soft\\nposterior cervical lymph nodes were palpated;\\nthe remainder of the examination was normal.\\nAt this time, testing for antibodies to brucella\\non a specimen of blood obtained 4 months ear-\\nlier and a current specimen were performed\\n(Table 1).\\nThe patient had received bacille Calmette-\\nGuérin vaccine in childhood, and a tuberculin\\nskin test had been positive years earlier. She\\nhad never taken antituberculosis medications.\\nShe had scoliosis of the thoracic spine, osteo-\\nporosis, and occasional hip pain; a bone scan\\nobtained 17 days earlier revealed minimal de-\\ngenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine,\\nwith no evidence of stress fractures. The pa-\\ntient had been born in Taiwan, immigrated to\\nthe United States 30 years earlier, and lived in\\nNew England. She was married and had two\\nhealthy adult children. She gardened frequently\\nand drank alcohol occasionally; she had no his-\\ntory of tobacco or illicit drug use, recent travel,\\nor exposure to sick persons. Medications in-\\ncluded ketorolac, ibuprofen, aspirin, azithromy-\\ncin, alendronate, and conjugated estrogens and\\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate. There were no\\nallergies.\\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8°C.\\nThere was severe pain on palpation of the right\\nlateral neck; there were no palpable masses or\\nlymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the ex-\\namination was normal. The next day, an MRI\\nscan obtained after the administration of gado-\\nlinium revealed a peripherally enhancing extra-\\ndural fluid collection along the posterior aspect\\nof the C5 and C6 vertebral bodies, a finding that\\nwas consistent with an epidural abscess. This\\nlesion resulted in mass effect over the ventral\\naspect of the spinal cord. The patient was admit-\\nted to the other hospital. The vital signs were\\nnormal, and the findings on physical examina-\\ntion were unchanged. Vancomycin and narcotic\\nanalgesia were administered intravenously. Mea-\\nsurements of serum electrolyte levels and renal\\nfunction were normal; results of other labora-\\ntory tests are shown in Table 1.\\nOn the fifth hospital day a diagnostic-test\\nresult was received. The patient was transferred\\nto this hospital for further care.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nDr. Javier M. Romero: An MRI scan of the cervical\\nspine, obtained on the day of admission to the\\nother hospital, shows high signal intensity with-\\nin the C5 and C6 vertebral bodies, most likely\\nrepresenting edema (Fig. 1A). T₂-weighted im-\\nages show a hyperintense epidural lesion at this\\nlevel, probably representing an epidural fluid col-\\nlection (Fig. 1B). T₁-weighted images obtained\\nafter the administration of gadolinium show lin-\\near enhancement at the margin of the epidural\\nlesion and enhancement of the overlying dura,\\nresulting in mild cord compression (Fig. 1C).\\nThe differential diagnosis for a progressive,\\nenhancing lesion involving two adjacent verte-\\nbral bodies, prevertebral soft tissues, and an\\nepidural fluid collection that does not compro-\\nmise the intervertebral disk or vertebral end\\nplates includes granulomatous osteomyelitis\\nand, less likely, an atypical presentation of a\\npyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis, a metastasis,\\nand lymphoma.1,2\\nDr. Julie L. Gerberding: This microbiologist was\\nadmitted with acute symptoms and signs sug-\\ngestive of a cervical epidural abscess, which fol-\\nlowed a history of neck pain and headaches for\\nweeks to months. Fever did not occur until 5 days\\nbefore admission, when the severity of her symp-\\ntoms escalated. She did not have the classic triad\\nof signs and symptoms of cervical epidural ab-\\nscess — fever, pain in the neck, and radiculopa-\\nthy — until the day before admission to the\\nhospital. However, most patients with epidural\\nabscesses do not initially present with this triad,\\nand the diagnosis should be suspected whenever\\nany combination of these findings occurs. Impor-\\ntant laboratory findings include the gradual de-\\nvelopment of anemia over a period of 3 months,\\na moderately elevated sedimentation rate, elevat-\\ned aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase\\nlevels at the time of admission, and negative\\nserologic tests for brucella.\\nSPINAL EPIDURAL ABSCESS\\nThere are many causes of spinal epidural ab-\\nscess. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common\\ncause in the United States, and the patient\\'s\\nacute illness was entirely consistent with that\\ndiagnosis.3 Hematogenous dissemination from\\na primary source in a patient who is at increased\\nrisk for invasive staphylococcal disease is the\\nmost common mechanism for the development\\nof an epidural abscess, but this patient had no\\nhistory suggestive of this. Since the emergence of\\ncommunity-acquired, methicillin-resistant staphy-\\nlococcal infections has increased the likelihood\\nthat a health care worker could be colonized with\\nstaphylococci, empirical treatment with vanco-\\nmycin was appropriate.\\nTUBERCULOSIS\\nThe patient\\'s history suggests a risk of exposure\\nto two pathogens that could account for her\\nclinical illness. She was born in a part of the\\nworld where tuberculosis is endemic. Despite\\nreceipt of bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine, she\\nmay have been infected with Mycobacterium tuber-\\nculosis before she moved to the United States.\\nThe most common manifestation of a tubercular\\nspinal infection is vertebral-body infection with\\nanterior collapse (Pott\\'s disease). The thoracic\\nand lumbar spines are much more likely to be\\naffected than is the cervical spine. Preservation\\nof the disk spaces, as seen in this case, is one of\\nthe hallmarks of spinal tuberculosis. Although\\nparavertebral abscesses are a more likely soft-\\ntissue complication, epidural abscesses also oc-\\ncur. The MRI findings of vertebral-body involve-\\nment, sparing of the disk space, and anterior\\nedema, as well as the posterior epidural abscess,\\nare consistent with M. tuberculosis infection.\\nBRUCELLOSIS\\nThe patient also reported occupational exposure\\nto a clinical specimen of B. melitensis 7 months\\nbefore admission, and she had been monitored\\nin the occupational health clinic for 4 months\\nafter the exposure. Patients with brucellosis may\\npresent with focal findings, but the disease is\\nalways systemic. It is one of the most common\\nzoonotic diseases in the world and remains a se-\\nrious threat to animals and humans in countries\\nsurrounding the Mediterranean Sea, on the Ara-\\nbian Peninsula, and in Central and South Ameri-\\nca. Humans acquire infection by ingestion of\\nunpasteurized milk products or, less commonly,\\ningestion of poorly cooked meat from infected\\nanimals, by direct or indirect exposure to the or-\\nganism through mucous membranes or broken\\nskin, or by inhalation of infectious material. In\\nlaboratories, inhalation of aerosols is an ex-\\ntremely important mode of transmission, be-\\ncause the inoculum necessary to cause disease is\\nvery low. In countries where the disease is endem-\\nic, it is the most common laboratory-acquired\\ninfection, occurring in 12% of laboratory work-\\ners in Spain, according to one study. In the United\\nStates, infection with brucella species is one of\\nthe most common laboratory-acquired infections,\\naccounting for 10% of all laboratory-acquired in-\\nfections, 24% of laboratory-acquired bacterial\\ninfections, and 11% of deaths attributable to oc-\\ncupational exposure.5 Thus, the risk that this pa-\\ntient acquired brucellosis from her exposure in\\nthe laboratory is high.\\nBrucellosis can involve any tissue, including\\nthe spine, although the frequency of vertebral\\ninvolvement is difficult to ascertain from pub-\\nlished case series. 6,7 Spinal involvement can be\\nfocal, as in this case, or it can involve multiple\\nvertebrae. The typical spinal involvement is a\\ndiskitis or spondylitis, but osteomyelitis and\\nabscesses are not rare, and soft-tissue masses,\\nincluding epidural abscesses and prevertebral\\nedema, occur in more than half the cases.6\\nThe patient\\'s occupational exposure occurred\\n7 months before she was admitted to the hospi-\\ntal and about 4 months before neck symptoms\\ndeveloped, which in retrospect may have been\\nthe first clinical evidence of infection. The incu-\\nbation period for brucella infection is highly vari-\\nable, ranging from a few days to many months.\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n(CDC) recommends that laboratory workers ex-\\nposed to brucella undergo active surveillance for\\nfever for 6 months after the last exposure, as\\nwell as testing for seroconversion with the use\\nof a microagglutination assay at the CDC or the\\nstate public health laboratory. In this case,\\nserum samples obtained both 2 weeks and\\n4 months after exposure were tested for bru-\\ncella antibodies, but the results were normal.\\nAntibody tests are usually positive by the time\\nthe patient has clinical evidence of brucellosis,\\nbut serial quantitative serologic assays are re-\\nquired for the monitoring of exposed laboratory\\nworkers. A prozone phenomenon, in which very\\nhigh titers of antibody interfere with agglutina-\\ntion, may cause a false negative test result. Al-\\nternatively, this patient may have had a second\\nunsuspected or unreported exposure to brucella\\nor sequestration of the organism within the\\nabscess.\\nIn patients with acute spinal infection, blood\\ncultures usually reveal the organism. This patient\\nbegan treatment with azithromycin 24 hours\\nbefore the blood cultures were drawn. Azithro-\\nmycin has some in vitro activity against brucella\\nspecies but does not have high activity in intrac-\\nellular phagolysosomes where the organism is\\nlocated. A negative blood culture in the presence\\nof antimicrobial therapy with azithromycin may\\ntherefore be a false negative result.\\nClinicians and laboratory staff involved in the\\ndiagnosis of brucellosis should also be cognizant\\nof federal regulations associated with this dis-\\nease. The possession, use, and transfer of B. abor-\\ntus, B. suis, and B. melitensis in the United States\\nare regulated under the \"select agent\" rules of\\nthe Department of Health and Human Services\\nand the Department of Agriculture (USDA) (see\\nwww.selectagents.gov) in accordance with the\\nCode of Federal Regulations (42 CFR 73, 7 CFR\\n331, and 9 CFR 121). The isolation of these spe-\\ncies, as well as associated laboratory exposures,\\nmust be reported to either the CDC or the USDA\\nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\\nSUMMARY\\nBrucella-associated vertebral osteomyelitis com-\\nplicated by an epidural abscess would account for\\nthis patient\\'s symptoms and signs. Although dis-\\ntinguishing spinal infection due to tuberculosis\\nfrom that due to brucellosis is difficult on purely\\nclinical grounds, the pretest probability of bru-\\ncellosis is high in view of the patient\\'s laboratory\\nexposure, her decision not to have prophylactic\\nantimicrobial treatment, and the absence of con-\\nditions that would cause reactivation of latent\\ntuberculosis. I suspect that the diagnostic-test\\nresult was a blood culture that showed B. meliten-\\nsis, a slow-growing organism that might take\\neven longer to be detected in the blood because\\nof the azithromycin treatment she had received.\\nDr. Eric S. Rosenberg (Pathology): Dr. Heller,\\nwhat was your clinical impression after seeing\\nthis patient at the other hospital?\\nDr. Howard M. Heller (Infectious Disease): Al-\\nthough I was concerned about brucella, my\\nconcern was mitigated by the negative serologic\\ntests so many months after the exposure, so\\nstaphylococcal infection was higher on my list.\\nBoth the radiologist and the neurosurgeon\\nthought that the abscess was in an area that\\nwould be difficult to aspirate or drain. I chose to\\ntreat the patient with vancomycin alone while we\\nawaited the results of blood cultures and re-\\npeated brucella serologic tests, performed at a\\ndifferent laboratory.\\nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\\nS. aureus osteomyelitis with epidural abscess.\\nDR. JULIE L. GERBERDING\\'S\\nDIAGNOSIS\\nB. melitensis vertebral osteomyelitis complicated\\nby an epidural abscess.\\nPATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION\\nDr. Mary Jane Ferraro: The diagnostic result was\\nthat of a blood culture. After 6 days of incuba-\\ntion, blood that was cultured aerobically in one\\nof the blood-culture bottles grew small, gram-\\nnegative coccobacillary organisms, which were\\nconsistent with brucella species. The isolate was\\nreferred that day to the Massachusetts Depart-\\nment of Public Health State Laboratory Institute\\nfor further identification, according to the current\\nprotocol of the CDC Laboratory Response Network\\nfor Bioterrorism. The next day, a presumptive\\nidentification of brucella was reported by the\\nstate laboratory. Rapid identification was achieved\\nwith the use of polymerase-chain-reaction nucle-\\nic acid amplification and genus-specific brucella\\nDNA probes. The organism was ultimately iden-\\ntified as B. melitensis biovar 3 at the CDC.\\nDETERMINING THE SOURCE OF THE INFECTION\\nOur first question was whether this infection had\\nresulted from the exposure 7 months earlier or\\nwhether there had been a second exposure. The\\norganism that the patient (the laboratory tech-\\nnologist) had been exposed to was from a spinal\\nepidural abscess in a 67-year-old woman and was\\nidentified as B. melitensis biovar 3. To definitively\\nlink our patient\\'s isolate to that specimen, Dr. Ba-\\nrun Kumar De at the CDC performed genetic pro-\\nfiling based on the variable number of tandem\\nrepeats at 15 different genetic loci (multilocus vari-\\nable-number tandem repeats assay) to determine\\nthe relatedness of the two isolates. B. melitensis\\nisolates from the original patient, her husband\\n(also infected with B. melitensis), and the laboratory\\ntechnologist were compared. The technologist\\'s\\nisolate matched the original patient\\'s isolate in 14\\nof the 15 loci and matched the husband\\'s isolate\\nin 13 of the 15 loci. Dr. De concluded that the tech-\\nnologist had probably been infected while work-\\ning with the B. melitensis culture 7 months earlier.\\nWe then asked why the results of microag-\\nglutination testing for IgG and IgM antibodies\\nto B. melitensis remained negative 4 months after\\nexposure. A specimen of blood obtained on the\\npatient\\'s admission to the other hospital was\\ntested at another reference laboratory with the\\nuse of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\\n(ELISA).10 The test revealed IgM and IgG anti-\\nbodies to brucella. A sample obtained 4 months\\nafter exposure was then retested both at the\\nCDC reference laboratory and at the Massachu-\\nsetts Department of Public Health State Labora-\\ntory Institute. According to the ELISA method,\\nthis specimen was positive for IgM and negative\\nfor IgG antibodies. Repeated microagglutination\\ntesting of that specimen at the two laboratories\\ndetected total antibody titers of 1:40 and 1:80,\\nrespectively, either of which represented an in-\\ncrease by a factor of three over the initial nega-\\ntive test. Tests for IgG antibody were negative at\\nboth laboratories. Had IgM antibodies been re-\\nported in the sample at the time, even at these\\nvery low levels, the hospital\\'s Occupational\\nHealth Service would have continued to monitor\\nthis patient\\'s symptoms.\\nLESSONS LEARNED BY THE LABORATORY\\nAn adverse event such as this is an opportunity to\\nlearn about problems in our practice and to cor-\\nrect them. We asked several questions.\\nShould the microbiology laboratory change\\nthe biosafety-level practices for tissue specimens?\\nOur procedures specified that the initial workup\\nof all positive blood cultures and of any slowly\\ngrowing organism resembling brucella from\\nanother specimen type should be performed in a\\nbiosafety cabinet with the use of biosafety level\\n3 (BSL3) practices (gown, gloves, and avoidance\\nof aerosols by using a biosafety cabinet). This\\ntechnologist reported that she initially suspected\\nhaemophilus species in the culture and per-\\nformed the initial tests on the open bench with\\nonly biosafety level 2 practices. We therefore\\nundertook complete retraining of the entire lab-\\noratory staff on the protocol for testing slowly\\ngrowing bacterial pathogens from tissues and\\nfluids. We also discussed whether it would be\\nfeasible to convert part of our laboratory to a\\nBSL3 facility but determined that it would be\\nneither feasible nor necessary in view of the low\\nincidence of brucella in our community.\\nAre our serologic testing methods adequate?\\nThe discrepant results of serologic testing ob-\\ntained in this case underscore the fact that sero-\\nlogic testing for brucella is not perfect, and both\\nthe sensitivity and specificity of the tests may\\nvary. The microagglutination test is considered\\nthe standard, 11 although there have been some\\nreports of lower sensitivity with this test than\\nwith some of the newer ELISA tests. However,\\nfalse positive IgM results have been reported\\nwith ELISA tests.11 In the future, we will request\\ntesting by both methods.\\nCan clinicians help? In order to minimize the\\nrisk of exposure of laboratory staff, any suspi-\\ncion of brucellosis, based on epidemiologic or\\nclinical information, should be communicated\\nto the laboratory on the requisition. This prac-\\ntice not only protects the staff but also benefits\\nthe patient, because if the laboratory knows\\nwhat organisms are suspected, a faster and more\\ndirected workup can be initiated. By presenting\\nthis case at a Clinicopathological Conference, we\\nhope to increase awareness of this problem\\namong clinicians.\\nDr. Rosenberg: Dr. Atkins, what would the Oс-\\ncupational Health Service do differently if an-\\nother occupational exposure to brucella occurs?\\nDr. Elisha H. Atkins (Occupational Health Ser-\\nvice): Although evidence supporting the use of\\npostexposure prophylaxis is limited, we would\\nmore strongly encourage it, particularly for\\nthose at highest risk from handling the speci-\\nmen. Second, we would follow exposed employ-\\nees for 6 months. In this case, we consulted the\\nDepartment of Public Health, and the incubation\\nperiod for brucella was thought to be up to 60\\ndays, so we followed exposed workers for twice\\nthat time, for 120 days. We would also change\\nour clinical evaluation of employees with symp-\\ntoms. I saw this employee when symptoms de-\\nveloped, 4 months after exposure, and thought\\nthe likelihood of brucellosis was low, because\\nsymptoms began after what we thought was the\\nmaximal incubation period and because she had\\nhad no fever and her serologic test for brucella\\nwas negative.

Emer-gency medical services was called and arrived approximately 7 minutes later. Ex-amination disclosed ventricular fibrillation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, includ-ing the administration of epinephrine and atropine and electrical defibrillationfollowed by the administration of lidocaine, was performed; a junctional cardiacrhythm was established after 4 minutes. The patient remained hypotensive and un-conscious. He was transported to this hospital. The trachea was intubated en route,and the lungs were ventilated by handheld bag.There was no history of trauma, and the patient had no known illnesses. He hadbeen born in South America and immigrated to the United States several years ear-lier; he was employed in construction and lived with relatives. On examination, he didnot respond to voice, sternal rub, or nasal stimulation. The temperature was 36.1°C,the blood pressure 97/52 mm Hg (during the administration of norepinephrine bycontinuous infusion), the pulse 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breathsper minute with assisted ventilation, and the oxygen saturation 96% while 100% in-spired oxygen was delivered. The pupils were fixed and 8 mm in diameter, and bloodwas present in the nares. There were rare myoclonic jerks. There were no spontane-ous respirations; oculocephalic, corneal, or gag reflexes; deep-tendon reflexes; orwithdrawal in response to pressure on the deep nail beds or pinching of the ex-tremities. He was incontinent of melanotic stool. Analysis of a urine specimen re-vealed cannabinoids and cocaine metabolites; other laboratory-test results are shownin Table 1. Urinalysis revealed a pH of 7.5, trace glucose, 3+ blood, 2+ protein, andtrace urobilinogen, as well as 3 to 5 hyaline casts, more than 100 red cells, 50 to100 white cells, many bacteria, and a moderate number of squamous cells per high-power field. Radiographs of the chest and abdomen and computed tomography (CT)of the head, cervical spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, after the administration ofcontrast material, showed no abnormalities. An electrocardiogram revealed sinustachycardia at a rate of 133 beats per minute and was otherwise normal.

Later that day,coffee-grounds material was aspirated from theoral gastric tube. Omeprazole was administeredfor gastric protection, and fluids and electrolyteswere administered to maintain normal blood pres-sure and serum electrolyte levels. On the secondhospital day, hypotension recurred that requiredpressor support, and cooling was stopped after 21hours. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1.Specimens of blood and urine and nasal swabswere sent for culture and remained sterile, and nopathogens were identified by stool culture. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered intrave-nously, and supportive care was continued. Theblood pressure continued to fluctuate, and thepatient was intermittently febrile.On the fifth hospital day, without sedation, thepatient did not respond to any stimuli and thepupils did not constrict. Magnetic resonance im-aging (MRI) of the brain after the administrationof gadolinium revealed restricted diffusion, con-sistent with diffuse hypoxic-ischemic injury andright uncal and bilateral cerebellar tonsillar her-niation. A radiograph of the abdomen showedpossible thickening of the haustral folds of thetransverse colon, suggestive of colitis. Mannitolwas begun. CT of the head on the sixth and eighthhospital days revealed progressive loss of gray-white differentiation, with effacement of sulci, bi-lateral uncal herniation, and downward herniationof the contents of the posterior fossa. On the ninthday, a brain scan obtained after the administrationof technetium-99m showed no appreciable uptakein the brain, and the patient met criteria for braindeath.The patient\\'s family expressed a wish to donatehis organs. The New England Organ Bank wasconsulted; a coordinator performed initial screen-ing to confirm his suitability as a donor and ob-tained consent for organ donation. Echocardiog-raphy revealed no abnormalities and a normalejection fraction, and cardiac catheterization re-vealed no coronary artery disease. Testing of theserum was positive for antibodies to cytomegalo-virus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) andnegative for syphilis, human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV) types 1 and 2, human T-lymphotropicvirus (HTLV) types I and II, hepatitis C virus(HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV).On the 11th hospital day, the patient was pro-nounced brain-dead and taken to the operatingroom for organ procurement. On initial inspec-tion of the abdomen and pelvis, the cecum andascending colon appeared inflamed and thick-ened. The heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, and pancreaswere procured for transplantation.A diagnostic procedure was performed.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSISDr. Camille N. Kotton: This 25-year-old man with noknown illnesses had a catastrophic event that re-sulted in brain death. His family generously agreedto donate his organs. With this patient, as withall potential organ donors, the transplantationteam needs to make a rapid assessment of the suit-ability of his organs for donation. On initial eval-uation, this patient appeared to be a good can-didate for organ donation. The presence of athickened colon, however, raised the question ofwhether there was a pathologic process such as aninfection or a neoplasm that could be transferredto the recipient on transplantation. I was involvedin this case and assisted the team in making thisdecision. The first step in the decision processstarts with an evaluation by the organ bank, whichwas done in this case. Dr. Delmonico, will you dis-cuss the role of the New England Organ Bank inassessing possible organ donors such as this one?Dr. Francis L. Delmonico: The New England OrganBank is 1 of 58 organ-procurement organizationsthat are members of the Organ Procurement andTransplantation Network that was established byCongress in 1984 and the United Network for Or-gan Sharing (UNOS).In our region, the New England Organ Bank isnotified of every imminent death in accordancewith federal mandate. On notification, a donationcoordinator makes an on-site evaluation as towhether the deceased person would be a suitableorgan donor, as occurred in this case. The foun-dation of this assessment is to determine whetherthe organ is likely to function properly after trans-plantation and whether there are any infectiousdiseases or cancers that could be transmitted tothe recipient through organ donation. The organbank coordinates a standard evaluation to deter-mine organ function (Table 2).

In this case, laboratoryevaluation included a battery of serologic tests forHIV, HBV, HCV, rapid plasma reagin, HTLV, CMV,EBV, and toxoplasma. Donor infection with HIV,HBV, or HCV is typically a \"deal breaker\" andwould preclude donation except to previously in-fected recipients. Infection with other potentialpathogens including EBV, CMV, and other herpes-viruses do not preclude organ donation, but theinformation is used in assessing the risk of infec-tion to the recipient and implementation of pro-phylactic or preemptive antiviral therapy. The CDChas defined exclusion criteria for organ donorsthat are based on behavior and history (Table 3) toreduce the potential for the transmission of HIV.Although our donor did not have any otherworrisome infections that would preclude organdonation according to UNOS policy, certain severeand difficult-to-eradicate active infections (e.g.,tuberculosis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and ra-bies) in a potential organ donor should precludeorgan donation. Potential donors with controlledinfections may be acceptable candidates.This donor had no identifiable risk factorsthat would rule out donation. The donor wasseropositive for CMV and EBV only; the recipientat our institution was seropositive for CMV andEBV, as well as for hepatitis C antibody andhepatitis B surface antibody; organ transplanta-tion appeared to pose an acceptable risk to thisdonor-recipient pair.Given the information available, our donor wasconsidered medically suitable for donation, and thenext step in the process was organ procurement.Dr. Elias, will you review the procurement proce-dure and your intraoperative findings?Dr. Nahel Elias: We performed the procurementby means of a thoracoabdominal midline incisionthat allowed comprehensive exposure and explo-ration. The thoracic and abdominal great vesselswere dissected. We cooled the organs in situ in-ternally with preservation solution infused throughthe abdominal aorta and externally with sterilesaline ice. Concurrently, the heart was arrested,and the cold ischemic time started. The blood wasdrained from the inferior vena cava, and the or-gans were sequentially recovered. We assessed thefunction of each organ on the basis of specificdonor information (Table 2).During the exploration, we noted an inflamedand thickened cecum and ascending colon.

Cancer transmission is minimizedby excluding donors with active or recent cancer,except nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ cer-vical cancer, since their transmission with trans-plantation is unprecedented. Donors with can-cers considered to be of low metastatic potential,such as certain tumors of the central nervous sys-tem or small renal-cell carcinomas, are variablyused. 10 Highly metastatic cancers should be ruledout by history, physical examination, and thoroughevaluation at the time of organ procurement.After primary thoracic and abdominal dissec-tion, the heart and lungs were procured, followedby the liver, pancreas, and kidneys. I then per-formed the diagnostic procedure a full-thick-ness colon biopsy — and the specimen was sentfor intraoperative examination of a frozen sec-tion. This was done after all organ recovery toavoid contamination with intraluminal coloniccontents.CLINICAL DIAGNOSISCancer or infection of the colon in a brain-deadorgan donor.PATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONDr. Richard L. Kradin: Examination of a full-thick-ness biopsy specimen of the cecum showed severeulcerative ischemic necrosis of the bowel wall(Fig. 1A). The cecal mucosa contained numerousgranulomas with refractile ova (approximately150 µm in length) surrounded by epithelioid his-tiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils (Fig. 1B).Some of the ova showed well-developed lateralspines that stained with the Fite method (a weaklydecolorized modification of the Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast stain for mycobacteria) (Fig. 1C), whereasothers had terminal spines (Fig. 1D). The appear-ances of the ova are consistent with schistosomalinfection. Speciation of schistosomes is achieved bydifferences in morphology of the ova, with Schis-tosoma mansoni showing a well-developed lateralspine, whereas S. haematobium and S. intercalatumshow well-developed terminal spines and S. japoni-cum shows a nonconspicuous terminal spine. Inthis case, the morphologic findings suggest amixed infection, possibly with S. haematobium orS. intercalatum; within South America, only S. man-soni has been identified, in Brazil.N ENGLJ MED 360;20 NEJM.ORG MAY 14, 2009The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

The Model for End-Stage Liver Diseasescore was 30 (on a scale of 1 to 40, with a higherscore indicating a greater severity of illness), pre-dicting a 53% likelihood of death within 3 months.11When we learned that the donor had schistoso-miasis involving the colon, we had to quickly as-sess the likelihood of transmission of this infec-tion to the recipient and weigh this risk against thebenefit of transplantation in a patient with a highlikelihood of dying within the next 3 months.In this case, our decision to accept this donorwas complicated by the findings of active colitispresumed secondary to schistosomiasis. Schisto-somiasis is an unusual finding in the evaluationof a prospective organ donor. Adult schistosomesdo not replicate within the human host, becausethey need snails to serve as the intermediate host.Therefore, we were concerned about the transmis-sion of nonreplicating adult worms, because theysometimes crawl into surgical sites and disruptcritical anastomoses. There have been several casereports that describe the successful use of organsfrom schistosoma-infected donors. 12-15In this donor, we also considered possible co-existing tropical infections, such as Chagas\\' dis-ease (transmitted by Trypanosoma cruzi), Strongyloidesstercoralis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, yellow fever,and leishmania, although some were ruled out bythe length of time since he had left South Amer-ica; the donor was later confirmed to be sero-negative for T. cruzi and strongyloides. We consid-ered numerous factors before deciding to proceedwith the transplantation procedure, including thesuccesses described in the literature, the avail-ability of effective therapy, the fact that this wasa potentially lifesaving two-organ transplantation,and that the initial liver biopsy showed no evi-dence of S. mansoni.DISCUSSION OF MANAGEMENTDr. Elias: In this case, the heart, lungs, and liverwere allocated by the New England Organ Bank.The primary liver recipient was a child; the trans-plantation surgeon accepted the left lateral seg-ment and planned to split the liver. The right lobeof the liver and a kidney were offered to the re-cipient from this hospital, who was waiting forboth. The other kidney was allocated separately.The transplantation surgeons in all cases were in-formed of the diagnosis of schistosomiasis in thedonor and decided to accept the organs.After the liver was split, we transplanted theright lobe into our recipient. During the same op-eration, she also received a kidney. The procedurewas uneventful. On the first postoperative day,the recipient required an additional surgery forcontrol of some intraabdominal bleeding. Her con-dition subsequently improved, and she was dis-charged on day 12. Her renal function was excel-lent 4 months later; she had liver dysfunction dueto recurrence of HCV infection, which was treatedand resulted in a partial response.Dr. Eric S.

As international travel increases, we maysee more unusual and unexpected donor-derivedinfections.Dr. Lloyd Axelrod (Medicine): Is the incidence ofdonor-derived infection increasing?Dr. Kotton: We do not know whether the in-crease in reports of these infections reflects a trueincrease in cases, an increased recognition of theissue, or both. Certainly, infections will be morecommon, given the increase in world travel and inforeign-born organ donors in the United States.A Physician: Do you routinely perform surgicalevaluation of the intestine in potential organ do-nors?

The only rea-son for the biopsy in this case was because I pal-pated the colonic thickening. It is very unusualfor a 25-year-old to have such an abnormality inthe colon, and we were most concerned about de-tecting colon cancer. The thickened colon in thispatient was diffuse, did not look like colon can-cer, and was more consistent with colitis; there is,however, no harm in performing an additionalbiopsy.A Physician: Were the other patients who re-ceived organs from this donor notified?Dr. Elias: We informed all the other transplan-tation surgeons about our findings, and eachtransplantation surgeon made a decision regard-ing the risk versus the benefit of transplantationfor their recipient. The risk has to be weighedagainst the seriousness of the disorders of thepatient on the waiting list and the consequencesof not receiving a transplant. For instance, wewould not transplant this donor\\'s pancreas, be-cause it is not a lifesaving organ and there is somerisk to the recipient.Dr. Delmonico: When we detect the presence oftransmissible infection in a potential donor, wedo contact the donor\\'s family if there is a poten-tial health hazard to a family member.Dr. Delmonico reports receiving honoraria from Wyeth, Astel-las, and Roche.

Emer-gency medical services was called and arrived approximately 7 minutes later. Ex-amination disclosed ventricular fibrillation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, includ-ing the administration of epinephrine and atropine and electrical defibrillationfollowed by the administration of lidocaine, was performed; a junctional cardiacrhythm was established after 4 minutes. The patient remained hypotensive and un-conscious. He was transported to this hospital. The trachea was intubated en route,and the lungs were ventilated by handheld bag.There was no history of trauma, and the patient had no known illnesses. He hadbeen born in South America and immigrated to the United States several years ear-lier; he was employed in construction and lived with relatives. On examination, he didnot respond to voice, sternal rub, or nasal stimulation. The temperature was 36.1°C,the blood pressure 97/52 mm Hg (during the administration of norepinephrine bycontinuous infusion), the pulse 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breathsper minute with assisted ventilation, and the oxygen saturation 96% while 100% in-spired oxygen was delivered. The pupils were fixed and 8 mm in diameter, and bloodwas present in the nares. There were rare myoclonic jerks. There were no spontane-ous respirations; oculocephalic, corneal, or gag reflexes; deep-tendon reflexes; orwithdrawal in response to pressure on the deep nail beds or pinching of the ex-tremities. He was incontinent of melanotic stool. Analysis of a urine specimen re-vealed cannabinoids and cocaine metabolites; other laboratory-test results are shownin Table 1. Urinalysis revealed a pH of 7.5, trace glucose, 3+ blood, 2+ protein, andtrace urobilinogen, as well as 3 to 5 hyaline casts, more than 100 red cells, 50 to100 white cells, many bacteria, and a moderate number of squamous cells per high-power field. Radiographs of the chest and abdomen and computed tomography (CT)of the head, cervical spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, after the administration ofcontrast material, showed no abnormalities. An electrocardiogram revealed sinustachycardia at a rate of 133 beats per minute and was otherwise normal.

Later that day,coffee-grounds material was aspirated from theoral gastric tube. Omeprazole was administeredfor gastric protection, and fluids and electrolyteswere administered to maintain normal blood pres-sure and serum electrolyte levels. On the secondhospital day, hypotension recurred that requiredpressor support, and cooling was stopped after 21hours. Laboratory-test results are shown in Table 1.Specimens of blood and urine and nasal swabswere sent for culture and remained sterile, and nopathogens were identified by stool culture. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered intrave-nously, and supportive care was continued. Theblood pressure continued to fluctuate, and thepatient was intermittently febrile.On the fifth hospital day, without sedation, thepatient did not respond to any stimuli and thepupils did not constrict. Magnetic resonance im-aging (MRI) of the brain after the administrationof gadolinium revealed restricted diffusion, con-sistent with diffuse hypoxic-ischemic injury andright uncal and bilateral cerebellar tonsillar her-niation. A radiograph of the abdomen showedpossible thickening of the haustral folds of thetransverse colon, suggestive of colitis. Mannitolwas begun. CT of the head on the sixth and eighthhospital days revealed progressive loss of gray-white differentiation, with effacement of sulci, bi-lateral uncal herniation, and downward herniationof the contents of the posterior fossa. On the ninthday, a brain scan obtained after the administrationof technetium-99m showed no appreciable uptakein the brain, and the patient met criteria for braindeath.The patient\\'s family expressed a wish to donatehis organs. The New England Organ Bank wasconsulted; a coordinator performed initial screen-ing to confirm his suitability as a donor and ob-tained consent for organ donation. Echocardiog-raphy revealed no abnormalities and a normalejection fraction, and cardiac catheterization re-vealed no coronary artery disease. Testing of theserum was positive for antibodies to cytomegalo-virus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) andnegative for syphilis, human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV) types 1 and 2, human T-lymphotropicvirus (HTLV) types I and II, hepatitis C virus(HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV).On the 11th hospital day, the patient was pro-nounced brain-dead and taken to the operatingroom for organ procurement. On initial inspec-tion of the abdomen and pelvis, the cecum andascending colon appeared inflamed and thick-ened. The heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, and pancreaswere procured for transplantation.A diagnostic procedure was performed.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSISDr. Camille N. Kotton: This 25-year-old man with noknown illnesses had a catastrophic event that re-sulted in brain death. His family generously agreedto donate his organs. With this patient, as withall potential organ donors, the transplantationteam needs to make a rapid assessment of the suit-ability of his organs for donation. On initial eval-uation, this patient appeared to be a good can-didate for organ donation. The presence of athickened colon, however, raised the question ofwhether there was a pathologic process such as aninfection or a neoplasm that could be transferredto the recipient on transplantation. I was involvedin this case and assisted the team in making thisdecision. The first step in the decision processstarts with an evaluation by the organ bank, whichwas done in this case. Dr. Delmonico, will you dis-cuss the role of the New England Organ Bank inassessing possible organ donors such as this one?Dr. Francis L. Delmonico: The New England OrganBank is 1 of 58 organ-procurement organizationsthat are members of the Organ Procurement andTransplantation Network that was established byCongress in 1984 and the United Network for Or-gan Sharing (UNOS).In our region, the New England Organ Bank isnotified of every imminent death in accordancewith federal mandate. On notification, a donationcoordinator makes an on-site evaluation as towhether the deceased person would be a suitableorgan donor, as occurred in this case. The foun-dation of this assessment is to determine whetherthe organ is likely to function properly after trans-plantation and whether there are any infectiousdiseases or cancers that could be transmitted tothe recipient through organ donation. The organbank coordinates a standard evaluation to deter-mine organ function (Table 2).

A thoroughlaboratory evaluation is also a critical part of thedonor evaluation, especially in the assessment ofinfectious risk. Cultures of blood and urine areroutinely obtained, and standard serologic testingis performed to detect potentially transmissiblepathogens.There have been numerous reports of donor-derived infections in solid-organ transplantationin the past few years, including rabies,1,2 West Nilevirus,3 lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Cha-gas\\' disease,5,6 and HIV.7 Prevention of donor-derived infections has been a main focus of thetransplantation community.

In this case, laboratoryevaluation included a battery of serologic tests forHIV, HBV, HCV, rapid plasma reagin, HTLV, CMV,EBV, and toxoplasma. Donor infection with HIV,HBV, or HCV is typically a \"deal breaker\" andwould preclude donation except to previously in-fected recipients. Infection with other potentialpathogens including EBV, CMV, and other herpes-viruses do not preclude organ donation, but theinformation is used in assessing the risk of infec-tion to the recipient and implementation of pro-phylactic or preemptive antiviral therapy. The CDChas defined exclusion criteria for organ donorsthat are based on behavior and history (Table 3) toreduce the potential for the transmission of HIV.Although our donor did not have any otherworrisome infections that would preclude organdonation according to UNOS policy, certain severeand difficult-to-eradicate active infections (e.g.,tuberculosis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and ra-bies) in a potential organ donor should precludeorgan donation. Potential donors with controlledinfections may be acceptable candidates.This donor had no identifiable risk factorsthat would rule out donation. The donor wasseropositive for CMV and EBV only; the recipientat our institution was seropositive for CMV andEBV, as well as for hepatitis C antibody andhepatitis B surface antibody; organ transplanta-tion appeared to pose an acceptable risk to thisdonor-recipient pair.Given the information available, our donor wasconsidered medically suitable for donation, and thenext step in the process was organ procurement.Dr. Elias, will you review the procurement proce-dure and your intraoperative findings?Dr. Nahel Elias: We performed the procurementby means of a thoracoabdominal midline incisionthat allowed comprehensive exposure and explo-ration. The thoracic and abdominal great vesselswere dissected. We cooled the organs in situ in-ternally with preservation solution infused throughthe abdominal aorta and externally with sterilesaline ice. Concurrently, the heart was arrested,and the cold ischemic time started. The blood wasdrained from the inferior vena cava, and the or-gans were sequentially recovered. We assessed thefunction of each organ on the basis of specificdonor information (Table 2).During the exploration, we noted an inflamedand thickened cecum and ascending colon. Noother abdominal or thoracic abnormality was not-ed.

Cancer transmission is minimizedby excluding donors with active or recent cancer,except nonmelanoma skin cancer or in situ cer-vical cancer, since their transmission with trans-plantation is unprecedented. Donors with can-cers considered to be of low metastatic potential,such as certain tumors of the central nervous sys-tem or small renal-cell carcinomas, are variablyused. 10 Highly metastatic cancers should be ruledout by history, physical examination, and thoroughevaluation at the time of organ procurement.After primary thoracic and abdominal dissec-tion, the heart and lungs were procured, followedby the liver, pancreas, and kidneys. I then per-formed the diagnostic procedure a full-thick-ness colon biopsy — and the specimen was sentfor intraoperative examination of a frozen sec-tion. This was done after all organ recovery toavoid contamination with intraluminal coloniccontents.CLINICAL DIAGNOSISCancer or infection of the colon in a brain-deadorgan donor.PATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONDr. Richard L. Kradin: Examination of a full-thick-ness biopsy specimen of the cecum showed severeulcerative ischemic necrosis of the bowel wall(Fig. 1A). The cecal mucosa contained numerousgranulomas with refractile ova (approximately150 µm in length) surrounded by epithelioid his-tiocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils (Fig. 1B).Some of the ova showed well-developed lateralspines that stained with the Fite method (a weaklydecolorized modification of the Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast stain for mycobacteria) (Fig. 1C), whereasothers had terminal spines (Fig. 1D). The appear-ances of the ova are consistent with schistosomalinfection. Speciation of schistosomes is achieved bydifferences in morphology of the ova, with Schis-tosoma mansoni showing a well-developed lateralspine, whereas S. haematobium and S. intercalatumshow well-developed terminal spines and S. japoni-cum shows a nonconspicuous terminal spine. Inthis case, the morphologic findings suggest amixed infection, possibly with S. haematobium orS. intercalatum; within South America, only S. man-soni has been identified, in Brazil.N ENGLJ MED 360;20 NEJM.ORG MAY 14, 2009The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

Exclusion Criteria for Organ Donors, Based on Behavior and History.*Men who have had sex with other men in the preceding 5 yearsPersons who report nonmedical intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection of drugs in the preceding5 yearsPersons with hemophilia or related clotting disorders who have received human-derived clotting-factor concentratesMen and women who have engaged in sex in exchange for money or drugs in the preceding 5 yearsPersons who have had sex in the preceding 12 months with any person described in the preceding four items or with aperson known or suspected to have infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)Persons who have been exposed in the preceding 12 months to known or suspected HIV-infected blood through percu-taneous inoculation or through contact with an open wound, nonintact skin, or a mucous membraneInmates of correctional systems (the purpose of this exclusion is to address issues such as difficulties with informedconsent and increased prevalence of HIV in this population)* The data are from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.8Dr. Kotton: The organ recipient at our institu-tion was a 53-year-old woman with end-stage liverdisease due to hepatitis C infection and end-stagerenal disease due to fibrillary glomerulonephritiswho had been receiving hemodialysis for 2 years.She was listed for both liver and kidney trans-plantation. The Model for End-Stage Liver Diseasescore was 30 (on a scale of 1 to 40, with a higherscore indicating a greater severity of illness), pre-dicting a 53% likelihood of death within 3 months.11When we learned that the donor had schistoso-miasis involving the colon, we had to quickly as-sess the likelihood of transmission of this infec-tion to the recipient and weigh this risk against thebenefit of transplantation in a patient with a highlikelihood of dying within the next 3 months.In this case, our decision to accept this donorwas complicated by the findings of active colitispresumed secondary to schistosomiasis. Schisto-somiasis is an unusual finding in the evaluationof a prospective organ donor. Adult schistosomesdo not replicate within the human host, becausethey need snails to serve as the intermediate host.Therefore, we were concerned about the transmis-sion of nonreplicating adult worms, because theysometimes crawl into surgical sites and disruptcritical anastomoses. There have been several casereports that describe the successful use of organsfrom schistosoma-infected donors. 12-15In this donor, we also considered possible co-existing tropical infections, such as Chagas\\' dis-ease (transmitted by Trypanosoma cruzi), Strongyloidesstercoralis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, yellow fever,and leishmania, although some were ruled out bythe length of time since he had left South Amer-ica; the donor was later confirmed to be sero-negative for T. cruzi and strongyloides. We consid-ered numerous factors before deciding to proceedwith the transplantation procedure, including thesuccesses described in the literature, the avail-ability of effective therapy, the fact that this wasa potentially lifesaving two-organ transplantation,and that the initial liver biopsy showed no evi-dence of S. mansoni.DISCUSSION OF MANAGEMENTDr. Elias: In this case, the heart, lungs, and liverwere allocated by the New England Organ Bank.The primary liver recipient was a child; the trans-plantation surgeon accepted the left lateral seg-ment and planned to split the liver. The right lobeof the liver and a kidney were offered to the re-cipient from this hospital, who was waiting forboth. The other kidney was allocated separately.The transplantation surgeons in all cases were in-formed of the diagnosis of schistosomiasis in thedonor and decided to accept the organs.After the liver was split, we transplanted theright lobe into our recipient. During the same op-eration, she also received a kidney. The procedurewas uneventful. On the first postoperative day,the recipient required an additional surgery forcontrol of some intraabdominal bleeding. Her con-dition subsequently improved, and she was dis-charged on day 12. Her renal function was excel-lent 4 months later; she had liver dysfunction dueto recurrence of HCV infection, which was treatedand resulted in a partial response.Dr. Eric S. Rosenberg (Pathology): Dr. Kotton, didyou treat the recipient for schistosomiasis?Dr. Kotton: Praziquantel was given to the re-cipient at 20 mg per kilogram of body weight(1700 mg) by mouth twice a day on postoperativeN ENGLJ MED 360;20 NEJM.ORG MAY 14, 2009The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.Downloaded from nejm.org by Thanh Nguyen on July 22, 2025.

As international travel increases, we maysee more unusual and unexpected donor-derivedinfections.Dr. Lloyd Axelrod (Medicine): Is the incidence ofdonor-derived infection increasing?Dr. Kotton: We do not know whether the in-crease in reports of these infections reflects a trueincrease in cases, an increased recognition of theissue, or both. Certainly, infections will be morecommon, given the increase in world travel and inforeign-born organ donors in the United States.A Physician: Do you routinely perform surgicalevaluation of the intestine in potential organ do-nors? Were you planning on harvesting the in-testine for bowel transplantation?Dr. Elias: Examination of the bowel is part ofthe donor evaluation.

The only rea-son for the biopsy in this case was because I pal-pated the colonic thickening. It is very unusualfor a 25-year-old to have such an abnormality inthe colon, and we were most concerned about de-tecting colon cancer. The thickened colon in thispatient was diffuse, did not look like colon can-cer, and was more consistent with colitis; there is,however, no harm in performing an additionalbiopsy.A Physician: Were the other patients who re-ceived organs from this donor notified?Dr. Elias: We informed all the other transplan-tation surgeons about our findings, and eachtransplantation surgeon made a decision regard-ing the risk versus the benefit of transplantationfor their recipient. The risk has to be weighedagainst the seriousness of the disorders of thepatient on the waiting list and the consequencesof not receiving a transplant. For instance, wewould not transplant this donor\\'s pancreas, be-cause it is not a lifesaving organ and there is somerisk to the recipient.Dr. Delmonico: When we detect the presence oftransmissible infection in a potential donor, wedo contact the donor\\'s family if there is a poten-tial health hazard to a family member.Dr. Delmonico reports receiving honoraria from Wyeth, Astel-las, and Roche.

The patient had been well until 5 days before this presentation, when fatigue, malaise, fever, chills, and cough that was productive of terra cotta-colored sputum developed. Three days before this presentation, he had presented to an urgent care clinic with nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal, and the patient was told he had a viral illness. Intravenous fluids were administered, and he was advised to return to the clinic if symptoms persisted or worsened. The next day, symptoms increased in severity, and the patient was unable to eat or drink owing to persistent nausea and vomiting. Back pain, neck pain, headache, and photophobia developed. The patient reported positional chest pain and dyspnea, which progressed rapidly, such that he could not walk up a flight of stairs. The day before presentation to this hospital, he presented to another hospital. The temperature was 36.5°C, the blood pressure 105/66 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. On examination, he appeared unwell and in mild distress. Breath sounds were decreased throughout the upper and lower lung fields, and scattered expiratory wheezes were present. The white-cell count was 21,890 per microliter (reference range, 4800 to 10,800), with a neutrophil count of 45% (9851 per microliter; reference range, 37 to 80% [1800 to 7700 per microliter]) and a band count of 23% (5035 per microliter; reference range, <5% [0 to 1100 per microliter]). The platelet count was 60,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000), the creatinine level 1.37 mg per deciliter (121.1 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.66 to 1.25 mg per deciliter [58.3 to 110.5 µmol per liter]), and the lactate level 3.50 mmol per liter (32 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.70 to 2.10 mmol per liter [6.3 to 18.9 mg per deciliter]). Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus was negative, as was a blood test for heterophile antibodies. Chest radiography revealed diffuse reticulonodular interstitial opacities in both lungs. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, doxycycline, methylprednisolone, and intravenous fluids were administered. During the next 3 hours, the oxygen saturation decreased to 80% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. Bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated. Dr. Shaunagh McDermott: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Fig. 1A through 1C) revealed ground-glass opacities in both lungs and interlobular septal thickening. Small bilateral pleural effusions were also present. Dr. Guell: The patient's family requested that the patient be transferred to this hospital. The patient's trachea was intubated in a nonemergency setting; continuous infusions of norepinephrine, propofol, and hydromorphone were started. He was transported by medical helicopter to this hospital, arriving approximately 17 hours after his presentation to the first hospital. On the patient's arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from family members. The patient had been camping in a northern New England forest for 9 days before presentation to the other hospital. Four days before presentation to this hospital, he found an unattached tick on his head, but he had no known tick bites; however, he had many mosquito bites. The patient lived on the mid-Atlantic coast with two cats in a trailer in which mold was reportedly present. He enjoyed outdoor activities such as dirt biking, hiking, boating, rafting, and swimming in fresh water. He worked in carpentry. During a house renovation project approximately 2 weeks before this presentation, he was bitten by a mouse; he did not seek medical attention. The patient had a history of chronic lower back pain. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He had smoked cigarettes for 13 years and had quit 1 year earlier. During the past year, the patient used electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and smoked commercial marijuana on a daily basis. His parents and older sibling were alive and well; his grandfather was living with a gastrointestinal cancer. The temperature was 36.3°C, the blood pressure 98/57 mm Hg, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP], 12 cm of water; tidal volume, 500 ml; fraction of inspired oxygen [F102], 1.0; respiratory rate, 15 breaths per minute). The pupils were symmetric and reactive, the lungs were clear on auscultation, and there were no rashes. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Tests for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens in the urine were negative, as were tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus antigens. Screening for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 and HIV type 1 p24 antigen was negative. Urinalysis results were normal. Blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. McDermott: A chest radiograph obtained on arrival at this hospital showed diffuse bilateral opacities, with endotracheal and enteric tubes in an appropriate position (Fig. 1D). Dr. Guell: Transthoracic echocardiography revealed diffuse hypokinesis of the left ventricle and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% (reference range, 50 to 75). A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid was colorless; the total protein level was 31 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), the glucose level 93 mg per deciliter (5.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), and the nucleated-cell count 1 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5). Gram's staining revealed few mononuclear cells and no neutrophils or organisms. Dr. Alexandra K. Wong: Flexible bronchoscopy performed on the first hospital day (Fig. 2) revealed diffuse erythema and inflammation in the airways, scattered areas of submucosal petechiae and hemorrhage, and scant secretions that were most prominent in the left lung. The bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid was clear and yellow; specimens were obtained for culture. These findings are nonspecific and are often seen with infectious or inflammatory processes, typically accompanied by thrombocytopenia. Dr. Guell: Treatment with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and doxycycline was continued, and gentamicin and furosemide were initiated. A diagnostic test was performed. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Dr. Nicolas Barros: This previously healthy 24-year-old man had fever, fatigue, cough, and dyspnea with rapid progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure in the absence of preceding upper respiratory symptoms. Before the development of symptoms, he had multiple epidemiologic exposures, including a rodent bite, freshwater activities, mosquito bites, an unattached tick, and e-cigarette use. The patient's initial illness was nonspecific until a cardiopulmonary disorder developed abruptly and led to intubation and initiation of vasopressor support. He had severe leukocytosis, prominent bandemia, and thrombocytopenia, but there was little to no involvement of the liver or kidneys. In addition, left ventricular dysfunction developed, and a bronchoscopy revealed diffuse erythema and inflammation but no overt purulence or hemorrhage. On the basis of his signs, symptoms, and exposures, the differential diagnosis is broad and includes e-cigarette-associated lung injury, community-acquired pneumonia, leptospirosis, tularemia, pneumonic plague, and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. DR. NICOLAS BARROS'S DIAGNOSIS Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome due to Sin Nombre virus infection. PATHOLOGICAL DISCUSSION Dr. Sarah E. Turbett: The diagnostic test was an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Sin Nombre virus, which was positive for both IgM and IgG at titers of 1:6400 or above (reference titer, <1:400). A qualitative assay to detect all hantaviral nucleic acids in the blood was also positive. Serologic testing, nucleic acid testing, and immunohistochemical staining are all acceptable methods for diagnostic confirmation of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Serologic testing for hantavirus-specific IgM is the most commonly performed diagnostic test, because almost all infected persons will have hantavirus-specific IgM at the onset of clinical symptoms. Hantavirus-specific IgG is often also present in the blood shortly after the onset of illness and can persist for months to years after the acute illness has occurred; the detection of rising titers of hantavirus-specific IgG in serial samples can also be used for diagnostic confirmation. Nucleic acid testing for the detection of hantavirus viremia can be a useful diagnostic tool only if it is performed early in the course of the acute illness, since blood levels of the virus decrease quickly after the onset of symptoms. Immunohistochemical staining for hantaviral antigens directly on tissue can also be performed. In this case, the patient met the laboratory criteria of the case definition for hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, as specified by the CDC. Given the patient's clinical syndrome, the diagnosis of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome was confirmed. Treatment of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome is largely supportive care, and mortality approaches 40%. Although the antiviral ribavirin has in vitro efficacy against hantavirus species, clinical data regarding its efficacy are mixed, and toxic effects from this medication are common. As such, use of this agent for the treatment of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome is not recommended. DISCUSSION OF MANAGEMENT Dr. Wong: The management of this patient's illness began even before he was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU). Available information at the time of triage was that a young, previously healthy man had respiratory failure that had progressed over the course of 12 hours from when he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute to when he was receiving bilevel positive airway pressure at 100% F102, with an inhalation pressure of 14 cm of water and an exhalation pressure of 8 cm of water. At these settings, the patient had a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao₂) of 70 mm Hg. He also had increased work of breathing, and bilateral lung infiltrates were observed on imaging. Given the patient's sudden onset of symptoms (<7 days), bilateral opacities seen on chest radiography and chest CT, absence of evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and severely impaired oxygen saturation, the patient met the criteria for ARDS. The severity of ARDS is graded on the basis of the ratio of Pao, to F10, with the patient receiving oxygen by invasive or noninvasive ventilatory strategies with a minimum PEEP of 5 cm of water. This patient's ratio of Pao, to Fio, was 70 mm Hg, which met the criterion for severe ARDS; severe ARDS has an estimated mortality of 45%. Although noninvasive ventilation, such as bilevel positive airway pressure, is used for respiratory support in some patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, there are data suggesting a decrease in mortality with the use of invasive mechanical ventilation, particularly among patients with the most severe ARDS (Pa02:F102 <150 mm Hg). Thus, intubation before the patient's transfer to this hospital was requested. On the patient's arrival at the ICU, the initial primary focus was to ensure that ventilator settings were adjusted appropriately for the management of ARDS. There are compelling data to support the use of ventilation with low tidal volume in patients with ARDS. A ventilation strategy involving low tidal volume (6 ml per kilogram of ideal body weight) has been shown to be associated with significantly lower mortality and fewer days of ventilator dependence than strategies that involve higher tidal volumes. This patient's tidal volumes were set to 6 ml per kilogram of his ideal body weight, and his oxygen saturation was further improved by adjustment of the PEEP and with the use of gentle diuresis. In cases of severe, refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure, additional interventions are available, with variable robustness of data to support their use. A trial that evaluated prone positioning among patients with severe ARDS showed a significantly lower incidence of death at 28 and 90 days among patients who had been placed in the prone position early in the course of their disease than among those who had remained in the supine position. Administration of paralytic agents early in the course of ARDS had previously been reported to reduce 90-day mortality and to increase the number of ventilator-free days. However, these results have since been called into question in the context of sedation protocols used in the ICU; on the basis of this more recent study, the need for paralysis may be obviated in some cases. Another possible intervention is the administration of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, which can result in abatement of hypoxemia by improving ventilation-perfusion matching, although this therapy has not been shown to affect long-term outcomes. Lastly, for patients who have ongoing refractory hypoxemia despite aggressive interventions, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be considered. This patient's oxygen saturation began to improve after adjustment of his ventilator settings in combination with small amounts of diuresis. Dr. Turbett: This patient initially received broad-spectrum antibiotics and ventilator support. When cultures revealed no evidence of a bacterial pathogen, antimicrobial therapy was discontinued. During the next few days, the patient's respiratory status improved, and his trachea was extubated on hospital day 3. By hospital day 5, he was able to ambulate independently, and he was discharged home with plans to follow up with his primary care physician.\\n\\n# CONTEXT — RETRIEVED_DOCS\\nNo Infomation\\n\\n# CONTEXT — KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH\\nNo Information\\n\\nThese are relative information now give yyou diagnosis for the PATIENT CASE.

      "Based on the patient's presentation, including fever, cough, dyspnea, rapid progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure, bilateral lung infiltrates on chest imaging, thrombocytopenia, and a history of a tick bite, the most likely diagnosis is **Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPR)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Information Gathering:** The patient presents with a constellation of symptoms including fever, cough, dyspnea, and rapid progression to respiratory failure. The history of a tick bite, rodent exposure (camping in a forest), and a rodent bite are all significant risk factors. The presence of thrombocytopenia and cardiac dysfunction (hypokinesis of the left ventricle) further supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Hypothesis Generation:** The differential diagnosis includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPR):** This is the most likely diagnosis given the clinical picture and exposure history.\n",
      "    *   **ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome):** The rapid progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral infiltrates are consistent with ARDS.\n",
      "    *   **Pneumonia:** While possible, the rapid progression and specific findings (thrombocytopenia, cardiac dysfunction) are less typical of bacterial or viral pneumonia.\n",
      "    *   **Other Tick-borne illnesses:** Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) can present with fever, rash, and thrombocytopenia, but the respiratory symptoms and cardiac involvement are less common.\n",
      "    *   **Other viral infections:** Influenza, COVID-19, and other respiratory viruses can cause pneumonia and ARDS, but the specific findings are less suggestive.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **HCPR:** The positive Sin Nombre virus test confirms the diagnosis. The clinical presentation (fever, cough, dyspnea, rapid progression to respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, cardiac dysfunction) is highly suggestive of Hantavirus infection.\n",
      "    *   **ARDS:** The chest imaging findings (ground-glass opacities, interlobular septal thickening) are consistent with ARDS. The patient's rapid deterioration and need for mechanical ventilation support the diagnosis.\n",
      "    *   **Pneumonia:** The absence of a clear bacterial source on cultures and the presence of thrombocytopenia and cardiac dysfunction make pneumonia less likely.\n",
      "    *   **Other Tick-borne illnesses:** RMSF is less likely given the lack of a rash and the presence of cardiac dysfunction.\n",
      "    *   **Other viral infections:** The negative influenza, RSV, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus tests make these less likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:** The patient's clinical presentation, exposure history, and laboratory findings strongly support the diagnosis of Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome. The positive Sin Nombre virus test confirms the diagnosis. The patient is critically ill and requires intensive care support.\n",

The patient's rapid deterioration and need for mechanical ventilation support the diagnosis.\\n    *   **Pneumonia:** The absence of a clear bacterial source on cultures and the presence of thrombocytopenia and cardiac dysfunction make pneumonia less likely.\\n    *   **Other Tick-borne illnesses:** RMSF is less likely given the lack of a rash and the presence of cardiac dysfunction.\\n    *   **Other viral infections:** The negative influenza, RSV, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus tests make these less likely.\\n\\n4.  **Reflection & Final Diagnosis:** The patient's clinical presentation, exposure history, and laboratory findings strongly support the diagnosis of Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome. The positive Sin Nombre virus test confirms the diagnosis. The patient is critically ill and requires intensive care support.\\n\\nWORKING_DIAGNOSIS: Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPR), severe\\nDISEASE_NAME: Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome\\n\", 'original_file': 'NEJMcpc1916256.json'}\n"
